      "The following is an excerpt from Fleming’s first James Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\". In this book, Bond has been assigned to ‘ruin’ a criminal figure named Le Chiffre by, as it happens, causing Le Chiffre to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. Along the way, Bond has acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond has, in fact, brought about the gambling losses, Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen.\n",

      "Le Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the right. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons.\n",
      "  Vesper was being led down a passage towards the back of the house. Bond suddenly decided. With a backward kick which connected with the thin man’s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him, Bond hurled himself down the passage after her. His plan was to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with the girl.\n",
      "  Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond’s foot whistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond’s shoe at the top of its arc, and twisted it sharply. As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion in which he took great pride, he righted himself with minimal damage.\n",
      "  “Search him.” barked Le Chiffre.\n",
