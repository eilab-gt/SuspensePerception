## Abstract

We suggest that readers’ reports of suspense are moderated by their perceptions of the range of solutions available to a textual dilemma. We provide seven experiments to test this relationship between problem solving and suspense. In each experiment, subjects read texts that placed James Bond (or some other fictional hero) in a situation of grave danger. The texts differed with respect to the apparent range of escapes available to the hero. Subjects gave ratings of the likelihood that the hero would escape and of their feelings of suspense. Although ratings of likelihood were little affected, ratings of suspense were heightened when readers believed that the number of paths to a solution had been restricted.

## 1. Introduction

Suspense is a critical component of engaging narratives. Previous research has shown that the presence or absence of suspense has a powerful impact on readers’ enjoyment of texts and even on their willingness to label texts as stories (Lichtenstein, 1981, 1982; Brewer and Ohtsuka, 1988a,b). In one experiment, Brewer and Lichtenstein (1981) wrote base texts which were not suspenseful. The base text for “The Trip” described a man driving home from work, coping with several minor inconveniences. To create a suspense version of this text, the researchers added an initiating event: a bomb with a 10-minute timer was activated when the driver got in. After reading a base or suspense version of three texts, subjects rated their liking for the text. On a 7-point scale, subjects gave, on average, ratings that were 2 points higher for the suspense versions of the narratives. Brewer and Ohtsuka (1988a,b) replicated the association between suspense and liking for naturally occurring stories of both American and Japanese origin.

## 2. Experiments

We intend the analogy between problem solving and suspense to enable us to make more precise predictions of relative levels of suspense between texts that share identical overall structures. Each of our experiments contrasts pairs of texts that differ only minimally: in each case, one of the texts contains extra material that is intended to change readers’ perceptions of the availability of possible solutions to the hero’s dilemma.

### 2.1. Experiment 1

In Experiment 1, we tested the hypothesis that readers’ perceptions of the set of possible solutions to a hero’s dilemma would moderate their feelings of suspense. Subjects read excerpts from a James Bond novel that differed with respect to the availability of escape routes. In the “No Mention” version, Bond’s fountain pen, a potential escape tool, is not mentioned. In the “Removed Pen” version, the pen is introduced but then taken away. Forty-five subjects read the “No Mention” version and forty-six read the “Removed Pen” version. Subjects made two judgments: how likely they believed it to be that Bond would escape and how suspenseful they found the text. As predicted, ratings of suspense were higher in the “Removed Pen” condition (mean = 4.38) than in the “No Mention” condition (mean = 3.35).

### 2.2. Experiment 2

To rule out the possibility that the mere mention of a potential solution could enhance suspense, Experiment 2 included a third version of the text, where the pen is mentioned but not removed. This “Mention Only” condition was compared to the “No Mention” and “Removed Pen” conditions. Results showed that suspense ratings were highest in the “Removed Pen” condition (mean = 4.38), followed by the “Mention Only” condition (mean = 3.89), and lowest in the “No Mention” condition (mean = 3.35).

### 2.3. Experiment 3

Experiment 3 replicated the findings of Experiments 1 and 2 with a different object, Bond’s pocket comb. The “Unused Comb” version did not mention the comb, while the “Used Comb” version introduced and then removed the comb. Results confirmed that removing a potential escape tool increased suspense.

### 2.4. Experiment 4

Experiment 4 created a set effect by alluding to past successful escapes. The “No Mention” version did not refer to past escapes, while the “Set Removed” version did. Suspense ratings were higher in the “Set Removed” condition (mean = 4.61) than in the “No Mention” condition (mean = 3.76).

### 2.5. Experiment 5

To ensure that it was the pruning of a possible solution, and not an explicit threat, that increased suspense, Experiment 5 included a “No Threat” condition, which omitted threatening language but retained the set removal. Results showed that suspense was enhanced in the “Set Removed” condition (mean = 3.99) and the “No Threat” condition (mean = 4.14), compared to the “No Mention” condition (mean = 3.34).

### 2.6. Experiments 6 and 7

Experiments 6 and 7 replicated the earlier findings with different heroes and villains. These experiments confirmed that the patterns of response were not specific to James Bond.

## 3. Discussion

Taken together, these results support our contention that readers experience suspense in parallel to their frustration as problem solvers. Authors can create suspense by pruning readers’ perceptions of paths toward solution. Although our experiments focus on suspense within specific circumstances of danger in spy novels, we believe that the analogy has broader scope to a wide variety of texts.
