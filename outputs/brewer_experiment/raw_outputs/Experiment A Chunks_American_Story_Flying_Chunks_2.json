"Here are the answers to the questions after each paragraph:\n\n**Paragraph 1:**\nHe moved swiftly down the stairs to the street and began to walk, thinking suddenly. It is only in sleep that we may know we live. There only, in that living death, do we meet ourselves and the far earth, God and the saints, the names of our fathers, the substance of remote moments: it is there that the centuries merge in the moment, that the vast becomes the tiny, tangible atom of eternity. He walked into the day as alertly as might be, making a definite noise with his heels, perceiving with his eyes the superficial truth of streets and structures, the trivial truth of reality.\n\n***Question 1:*** 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n***Question 2:*** 7. Extremely\n***Question 3:*** 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n***Question 4:*** 2. Slightly surprised\n***Question 5:*** 2. Slight irony\n\nThe paragraph starts with a sense of movement and sudden thinking, but the content is more introspective and philosophical, leaving the reader feeling neutral about what's to come. The reader is extremely interested in learning more about past events, as the paragraph explores abstract ideas about sleep and reality. The reader is neutral about learning more about future events, as the paragraph is more focused on the present moment. There's a slight sense of surprise at the philosophical musings, and a slight irony in the contrast between the abstract ideas and the mundane reality of walking down the street.\n\n**Paragraph 2:**\nHelplessly his mind sang, He flies through the air with the greatest of ease, the daring young man on the flying trapeze, then laughed with all the might of his being.

In the gutter he saw a coin which proved to be a penny dated 1923, and placing it in the palm of his hand he examined it closely, remembering that year and thinking of Lincoln, whose profile was stamped upon the coin. There was almost nothing a man could do with a penny. I will purchase a motor-car, he thought. I will dress myself in the fashion of a fop, visit the hotel strumpets, drink and dine, and then return to the quiet. Or"
