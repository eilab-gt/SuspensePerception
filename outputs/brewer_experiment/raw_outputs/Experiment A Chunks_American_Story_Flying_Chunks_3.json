"Here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?\"***\n2. Slightly\n\nThe passage mentions the narrator's desire to read certain books, which suggests a sense of longing or anticipation, but it's not a strong feeling. The narrator is more focused on their current situation of hunger and poverty.\n\n***Question 2: \"To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?\"***\n5. Moderately\n\nThe passage hints at the narrator's past experiences, such as being in a hospital and living in Brooklyn, but these events are not fully explored. The narrator's thoughts about Mollica and his desire to see California before dying suggest a curiosity about the past, but it's not a dominant feeling.\n\n***Question 3: \"To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?\"***\n6. Very much\n\nThe passage ends with the narrator's desperate desire to find work and avoid death, which creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and this curiosity drives the desire to learn more about events yet to come.\n\n***Question 4: \"To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?\"***\n3. Somewhat surprised\n\nThe passage's matter-of-fact description of the narrator's dire situation and their desperate thoughts about dying might be surprising to some readers, especially given the narrator's somewhat detached tone.\n\n***Question 5: \"To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?\"***\n7. Extreme irony\n\nThe passage's contrast between the narrator's intellectual pursuits (reading books) and their physical needs (hunger and poverty) creates a sense of irony. The narrator's desire to read Hamlet or Huckleberry Finn while struggling to survive is a stark reminder of the disconnect between their intellectual ambitions and their harsh reality."
