**Answer:** 3. Somewhat 

*The passage describes a ritualistic event called "the lottery," and the buildup of details about the preparations suggests something significant is about to happen. This creates a sense of anticipation.*

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

*While the passage mentions some past practices that have been discontinued, it doesn't leave me with a strong desire to know more about them at this point.*
