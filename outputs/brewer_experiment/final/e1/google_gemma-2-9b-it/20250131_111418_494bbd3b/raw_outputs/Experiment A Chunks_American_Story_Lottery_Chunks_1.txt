Here are my responses to the questions after the first paragraph of Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery":

**Question 1: To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 3. Somewhat 

*The description of the sunny day and the villagers gathering creates a sense of normalcy, but there's an underlying tension in the children's behavior and the men's quiet jokes. This hints at something unusual about to happen.*

**Question 2: To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?**

**Answer:** 2. Slightly

*We have a basic understanding of the setting and the day's events. While there's a sense of history implied (the lottery being an annual event), I'm not particularly curious about specific past events at this point.*

**Question 3: To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 5. Moderately

*The paragraph sets up a clear expectation of the lottery, but the details are vague. I'm curious to see how the lottery unfolds and what its significance is to the villagers.*

**Question 4: To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 1. No surprise

*The passage is descriptive and doesn't contain any unexpected twists or revelations.*

**Question 5: To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 2. Slight irony

*The juxtaposition of the idyllic summer day with the ominous gathering for the lottery creates a subtle sense of irony.*
