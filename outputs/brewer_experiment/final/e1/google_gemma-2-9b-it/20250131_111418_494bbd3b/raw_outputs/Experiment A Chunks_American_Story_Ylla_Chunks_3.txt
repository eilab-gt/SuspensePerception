Here are my responses to your questions after reading the provided paragraph:

**Question 1: To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 6. Very much

**Explanation:**  The passage builds a sense of tension and anticipation. The wife's strange behavior, the husband's growing irritation, and the mention of an "expected thing" all point towards a significant event about to unfold.

**Question 2: To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Explanation:** While there are hints of a backstory (the husband's trips to Xi City, the couple's lack of outings), the focus is clearly on the present situation and what's to come.

**Question 3: To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 7. Extremely

**Explanation:** The ending leaves us on a cliffhanger. The wife's trembling, the mysterious phial, and the description of the flame birds create a strong desire to know what happens next.

**Question 4: To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 3. Somewhat surprised

**Explanation:** The wife's sudden song and her inability to recall the words were unexpected. The husband's sudden change of heart and the mention of the "expected thing" also add to the surprise.

**Question 5: To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 2. Slight irony

**Explanation:** There's a slight irony in the husband's eagerness to go out after months of staying home, especially given his previous disinterest.
