Here are my responses to the questions after the first paragraph:

**Question 1: To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 3. Somewhat 

*The passage sets up a scene with a ritualistic event ("the lottery") and introduces a character who arrives late, creating a sense of anticipation about what might happen.*

**Question 2: To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?**

**Answer:** 2. Slightly

*We know enough about the setup to be curious, but there isn't a strong urge to delve into past events yet.*

**Question 3: To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 5. Moderately

*The late arrival and the mention of "the lottery" definitely pique curiosity about what will transpire.*

**Question 4: To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 1. No surprise

*The information presented is fairly straightforward.*

**Question 5: To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

*There are hints of potential irony (a seemingly cheerful event called "the lottery"), but it's too early to tell.*
