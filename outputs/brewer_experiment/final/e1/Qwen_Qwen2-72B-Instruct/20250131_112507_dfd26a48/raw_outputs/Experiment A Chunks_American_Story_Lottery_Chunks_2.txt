The description of the lottery being conducted by Mr. Summers, who is described as jovial and involved in civic activities, creates a sense of anticipation and curiosity about the nature of the lottery. The villagers' hesitation and the mention of tradition and the old box suggest there is more to the story, which moderately increases anticipation. There is slight surprise in the juxtaposition of the festive activities Mr. Summers organizes with the more ominous tone around the lottery. The irony lies in the villagers' reluctance to change the box, which seems to hold significant importance, despite its shabbiness and the yearly discussion of replacing it.
