The passage tells the story of Old Henry Reifsneider and his wife Phoebe, who have lived together for forty-eight years on a farm that has seen better days. The house, built by Henry's grandfather, is weather-beaten and surrounded by large, lovely trees that make the interior seem damp. The furniture is old and faded, and the carpet, made by Phoebe fifteen years before she died, is worn and faded to a dull grey and pink. The orchard to the east of the house is full of rotting apple trees, and the low buildings that once housed chickens, a horse or two, a cow, and several pigs are now greyish-black from lack of paint.

Henry and Phoebe had seven children, but three died, and the remaining four have moved away and rarely think of their parents. Despite this, Henry and Phoebe are a loving couple who have fastened themselves to their circumstances like moss on stones. Their activities have become fewer and fewer as they have aged, and they have only themselves to look after. When Phoebe becomes sick and dies, Henry is left alone and wonders where she has gone and how soon he will die. He tries to keep himself busy with farming, but it is sad to come into the house in the evening and find no shadow of Phoebe. He reads the newspapers and his Bible, but he can get little comfort from these things. Mostly he sits and wonders where Phoebe has gone and how soon he will die. After five long months, a change begins.
