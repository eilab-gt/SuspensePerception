The passage describes a couple, Ylla and her husband, embarking on a journey using a canopy lifted by birds. The husband suggests a trip to the Blue Mountains, which Ylla initially resists but then agrees to. The anticipation and excitement come from the unusual mode of travel and the sudden change in plans, which suggests potential conflict or a significant event. The desire to learn more about past events is moderate, as the relationship dynamics and the reason for Ylla's resistance to the trip are intriguing. The desire to learn more about future events is high due to the tension between the couple and the unexpected turn of events. There is no significant surprise in the information given, but there is a sense of irony in the husband's casual suggestion of the trip, which Ylla seems to find significant.
