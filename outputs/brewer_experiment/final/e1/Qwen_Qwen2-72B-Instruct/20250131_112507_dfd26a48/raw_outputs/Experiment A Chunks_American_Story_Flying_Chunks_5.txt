The passage describes a man's struggle to find work and his eventual acceptance of his fate. The anticipation and excitement come from wondering how the man will fare in his job search and what his ultimate decision will be regarding his life. There is also a sense of anxiety about the man's deteriorating health and the bleakness of his situation. The desire to learn more about past events is neutral because the focus is on the man's current predicament and future, rather than his past. The surprise comes from the man's decision to focus on polishing a penny and his eventual departure from his body, which is unexpected. The irony is not strongly present, but there is a sense of the absurd in the man's situation, such as his focus on the penny and his interactions with the employment agencies.
