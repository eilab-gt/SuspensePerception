The passage is filled with a sense of mystery and anticipation, particularly regarding the origin of the song and the woman's sudden ability to sing it. The husband's reaction to the song and his insistence on going out, despite the woman's reluctance, adds to the intrigue. The woman's internal conflict and the unusual setting contribute to a feeling of wanting to know more about what will happen next. The surprise element is not strong, but the unfolding events are intriguing. There is a slight sense of irony in the husband's behavior, as his reaction to the song and his sudden desire to go out seem out of character and possibly related to the song's effect on him.
