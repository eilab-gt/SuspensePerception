The passage describes the protagonist's thoughts and actions as he walks through the streets, reflecting on the nature of reality and his own existence. The contrast between his philosophical musings and the mundane actions he contemplates, such as buying a motor-car with a penny, creates a sense of irony. The surprise comes from the unexpected depth of his thoughts juxtaposed with the triviality of his actions. The anticipation for future events is neutral as the passage does not provide clear hints about what might happen next. The desire to learn more about past events is somewhat present due to the mention of the year 1923 and the penny, which might be significant in the context of the story.
