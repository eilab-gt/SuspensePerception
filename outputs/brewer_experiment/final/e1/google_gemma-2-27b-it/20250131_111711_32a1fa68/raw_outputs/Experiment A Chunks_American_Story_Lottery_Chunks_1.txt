Here are my responses to your questions after reading the first paragraph:

***Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"***

**3. Somewhat** - The seemingly idyllic setting and the mention of a "lottery" create a sense of unease and make me curious about what this lottery entails.

***Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?"***

**2. Slightly** - I'm slightly curious about the history of this lottery and why it's such a significant event in the village.

***Question 3: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"***

**6. Very much** - The mysterious nature of the lottery and the children's stone-gathering make me very eager to find out what happens next.

***Question 4: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"***

**2. Slightly surprised** - The contrast between the pleasant summer day and the mention of a lottery is slightly surprising.

***Question 5: "To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?"***

**3. Some irony** - There's a subtle irony in the juxtaposition of the cheerful atmosphere and the ominous implication of the lottery.
