Here are my responses to your questions after reading the provided passage:

**Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"**

* **3. Somewhat** - The passage sets a somewhat ominous tone with the description of the lottery and the villagers' behavior. This creates a sense of anticipation about what the lottery entails.

**Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?"**

* **5. Moderately** - I'm curious about the history of the lottery and why it's such a significant tradition in this village. The mention of the original box and the story about its predecessor pique my interest.

**Question 3: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

* **6. Very much** - The passage builds suspense, and I'm very curious to find out what happens during the lottery and what the consequences are for the "winner."

**Question 4: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

* **3. Somewhat surprised** - The description of the lottery being run by a jovial man and the villagers' seemingly casual attitude towards it is a bit surprising, given the ominous tone.

**Question 5: "To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?"**

* **3. Some irony** - There's a sense of irony in the contrast between the seemingly ordinary nature of the event (a lottery run by a friendly man) and the villagers' apprehensive distance from the black box.
