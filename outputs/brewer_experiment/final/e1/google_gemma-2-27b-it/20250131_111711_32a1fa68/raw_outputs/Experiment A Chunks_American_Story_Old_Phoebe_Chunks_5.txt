**Explanation:**

The passage sets up a somewhat melancholic tone with the death of Phoebe and Henry's subsequent loneliness. There's a sense of anticipation about how Henry will cope and whether he'll find a way to move forward. The slight surprise comes from the abruptness of Phoebe's death and Henry's initial reluctance to leave his home.  The ending hints at a potential change, making me moderately curious about what that change might be.
