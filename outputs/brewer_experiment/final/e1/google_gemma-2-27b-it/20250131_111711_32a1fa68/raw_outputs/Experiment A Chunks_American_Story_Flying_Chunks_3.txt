**Explanation:**

The passage sets up a sense of desperation and impending crisis. The narrator's hunger and contemplation of death create anticipation and anxiety about what will happen next. There's a hint of irony in the narrator's desire to read great literature while facing starvation, highlighting the contrast between intellectual pursuits and basic survival needs.  The mention of the young Italian's dying wish to see California adds a layer of pathos and makes me curious about the narrator's own unfulfilled desires.
