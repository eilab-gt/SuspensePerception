Here are my answers to your questions based on the passage:

**Question 1: "Overall, how much did you enjoy, appreciate, or like the passage?"**

There was no physical violence depicted in the passage.

**Question 9: "To what extent did you think that the author was trying to express an insight about human nature, or a truth about the 'human condition'?"**
