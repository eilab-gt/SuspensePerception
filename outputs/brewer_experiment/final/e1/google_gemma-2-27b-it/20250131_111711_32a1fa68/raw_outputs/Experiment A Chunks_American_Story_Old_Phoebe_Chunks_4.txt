**Reasoning:**

The passage sets up a somewhat melancholic scene of an aging couple, hinting at potential future conflicts or challenges. The will being of little value and Henry's occasional moodiness create a sense of anticipation about how their situation might evolve. There's a slight surprise at the state of their farm and the fact that the will is practically worthless. The irony lies in the contrast between Henry's complaints and Phoebe's unwavering devotion, suggesting a complex dynamic in their relationship.
