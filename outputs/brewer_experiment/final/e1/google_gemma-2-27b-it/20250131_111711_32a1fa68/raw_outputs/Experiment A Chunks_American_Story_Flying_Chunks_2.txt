**Explanation:**

The passage sets up an intriguing contrast between the narrator's internal world (dreams, thoughts about eternity) and his mundane actions (walking, finding a penny). This creates a sense of anticipation about how these two aspects might intersect. The mention of "inward vigor" and the narrator's ironic thoughts about spending the penny add a touch of irony and make me curious about his character and motivations.
