**Explanation:**

The passage creates a sense of intrigue about the narrator's situation. His detailed descriptions of food and his sudden shift to thoughts of homelessness and death pique my curiosity about what led him to this point. I'm somewhat anxious to see how his situation unfolds.

The mention of "An Application for Permission to Live" is slightly surprising and hints at a potentially surreal or allegorical element to the story. However, there isn't enough information yet to determine the extent of irony.
