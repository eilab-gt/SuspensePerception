2. Slight irony 


**Reasoning:**

The description of the house and its worn-down state creates a sense of melancholy and hints at a potentially sad story. The mention of the son's death adds to this feeling and makes me slightly curious about the circumstances surrounding it. There's a slight sense of irony in the contrast between the sturdy, well-built furniture and its faded, dilapidated condition.
