Here are my responses to your questions after reading the provided passage:

**Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"**

* **3. Somewhat** - The passage sets up a sense of mystery and tradition surrounding the lottery. The details about the box, the slips of paper, and the forgotten rituals create a feeling of anticipation about what the lottery entails.

**Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?"**

* **5. Moderately** - I'm curious about the history of the lottery. Why was it started? What was the original purpose? What were the forgotten rituals like?

**Question 3: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

* **6. Very much** - I'm very curious about what happens during the lottery. What are the rules? What is at stake?

**Question 4: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

* **3. Somewhat surprised** - I was slightly surprised by the casual way the lottery is described. The focus on logistical details like the box and the slips of paper makes it seem almost mundane, which is unsettling given the air of mystery.

**Question 5: "To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?"**

* **2. Slight irony** - There's a slight sense of irony in the contrast between the importance placed on tradition and the fact that so much of the ritual has been forgotten or changed.
