Here are my answers to the questions:

***Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage is quite surreal and dreamlike, with a stream-of-consciousness style that makes it difficult to discern a clear narrative or plot. As a result, I don't feel a strong sense of anticipation or excitement about what might come next, nor do I feel anxious about any potential events.

***Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"***
3. Somewhat

While the passage is quite abstract and doesn't seem to be building towards a specific plot or climax, I am somewhat curious about what other surreal and imaginative scenarios the author might describe. The passage has a certain poetic and dreamlike quality that makes me want to keep reading, if only to see what other vivid and unusual images the author will conjure up.

***Question 3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"***
6. Very surprised

The passage is full of unexpected and surreal images, from "clenched teeth, remembrance, much warmth volcanic" to "Mr. Eliot with rolled sleeves baking bread" to "a multitude of Jews, tomorrow is Monday, no dancing in the streets." The sheer variety and strangeness of these images makes me feel very surprised and intrigued.
