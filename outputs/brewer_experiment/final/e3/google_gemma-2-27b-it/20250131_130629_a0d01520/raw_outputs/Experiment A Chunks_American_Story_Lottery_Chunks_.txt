**6. Very much** - The detailed description of the lottery's procedures, the shift from wood chips to paper slips, and the emphasis on tradition despite forgotten rituals all contribute to a growing sense of unease and anticipation.

***Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"***
