5. Moderately surprised 


**Explanation:**

The paragraph is a whirlwind of seemingly disconnected images and ideas. This creates a sense of curiosity and anticipation about how these elements might connect or be explained. The abrupt shift from abstract concepts to the mundane act of the man getting ready for his day adds to the intrigue.  The surreal and sometimes jarring juxtapositions (like "jazz at the opera house" and "Stalin, Hitler, a multitude of Jews") are surprising and make me want to understand the author's intent.

Here are my responses to your questions after reading the second paragraph:

**Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"**

3. Somewhat

**Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Question 3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

2. Slightly surprised 

**Explanation:**

The paragraph shifts from a philosophical reflection on sleep and consciousness to a more mundane description of the man's walk and thoughts. The sudden outburst of laughter and the reference to Edgar Guest feel a bit jarring, but not entirely unexpected given the stream-of-consciousness style. The ending, with the man contemplating the possibilities of a single penny, is intriguing and leaves me wondering if this will lead to a significant event or simply be another fleeting thought.

Here are my responses to your questions after reading the third paragraph:

**Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"**

5. Moderately

**Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

6. Very much

**Question 3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

3. Somewhat surprised

**Explanation:**

The paragraph introduces a sense of urgency and desperation with the man's focus on hunger and his fear of dying. The juxtaposition of his intellectual desires (reading *Hamlet* or *Huckleberry Finn*) with his basic need for food and work creates a poignant tension. The mention of the young Italian, Mollica, adds a layer of pathos and makes me wonder if the narrator will meet a similar fate. The ending, with his desire for even mundane work, highlights the desperation of his situation and leaves me wanting to know if he will find a way to survive.

Here are my responses to your questions after reading the fourth paragraph:

**Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"**

4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

5. Moderately

**Question 3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

2. Slightly surprised

**Explanation:**

The paragraph shifts from the man's desperate hunger to a fantastical vision of feasting on exotic foods. This sudden shift is somewhat surprising, but it also highlights the contrast between his current reality and his desires. The idea of writing "An Application for Permission to Live" is intriguing and darkly humorous. The ending, with the possibility of seeking help from the Salvation Army, suggests a potential turning point, but I'm not sure which direction the story will take.

Here are my responses to your questions after reading the fifth paragraph:

**Question 1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"**

1. Not at all

**Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

1. Not at all

**Question 3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Explanation:**

The paragraph details the man's futile attempts to find work and his eventual acceptance of his fate. The ending, with his death and transformation into a state of "dreamless, unalive, perfect," feels inevitable given the bleak tone of the passage. There are no loose ends or unanswered questions, so I don't feel any anticipation or desire to know more. The surreal imagery of his final moments is somewhat surprising, but it fits with the overall dreamlike quality of the narrative.
