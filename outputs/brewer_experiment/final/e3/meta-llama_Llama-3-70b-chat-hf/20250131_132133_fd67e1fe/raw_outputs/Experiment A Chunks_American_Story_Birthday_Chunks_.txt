I would rate this a 3 (Somewhat). The passage sets up an interesting encounter between Judge Hammersley and Albert Engelhardt, and the Judge's thoughts about Albert's family and their history create a sense of intrigue. The mention of a birthday party and a favor being asked of the Judge also raises questions about what might happen next.

I would rate this a 5 (Moderately). The passage has piqued my interest in the characters and their relationships, and I want to know more about Albert's plans for his uncle's birthday and how the Judge's involvement might play out. I'm also curious about the backstory of the Engelhardt family and how they fell from their former prosperity.

***Question 3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"***
I would rate this a 2 (Slightly surprised). The passage doesn't contain any major plot twists or shocking revelations, but the details about the Engelhardt family's history and Albert's current circumstances are unexpected and add to the sense of intrigue. The Judge's character and his thoughts about Albert also provide some surprises, as he seems to be a complex figure with a mix of sympathetic and critical feelings towards Albert.
