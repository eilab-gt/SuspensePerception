2    Mr K went back to his room, still irritable, feeling his age, feeling the dust in his bones, the dryness in his throat, the aching in his skull. He was a scholar and had been all of his life. It was not until he was eighty years old that he realized he was unhappy; he had been working so hard, he had not noticed the time passing. He had been on Mars for forty years. He was eighty-one, and he wanted to go back to Earth. He was tired of the old Martian books. He wanted to see a fresh world, new cities, new people. He looked out his window at the blue sky, the dead sea, the old fossils and the crumbling bone town, and he felt sad. He had been born on Earth and had come to Mars when he was twenty-one. He had loved Martian history, the old books, the ancient languages, the past. But now he was tired of the past. He wanted a future. He wanted to live before he died. He wanted to smell the green wetness of Earth, not the rusty dryness of Mars. He had been thinking these thoughts for over a year, and he knew what he must do. He must talk to his wife. It was not going to be easy. They had been married for sixty years. They had been happy, but the happiness had worn away, as sand wears away rock with constant rubbing. They had been rubbing together, thought against thought, desire against desire, for so long that much of their togetherness had been rubbed away. They were like two stones that had been grinding together for a million years. There they were, side by side, but separated by a fine powder of dislike and irritability. He looked at his hands. They were the hands of an old man. He opened and closed them. He felt the stiffness in the joints. He looked at his books, his metal books, his crystal books, his electronic books, his papyrus books from the fourth and fifth centuries before the birth of Christ, his scrolls, his tablets. He had spent too much time with these things. They were his children, his life, his joy, and now they were his burden. He got up slowly from his chair and walked through the house to the room where his wife was. He stood in the doorway, watching her. She was still young-looking, still beautiful. She was like the Martian landscape, all dried blood and fossils and old, faded dreams. He realized that he had not looked at her closely for a long time. He had not really seen her. He had been too busy with his books, his studies, his thoughts. He had been too busy living in the past to see the present or the future. He cleared his throat. ‘Mrs K,’ he said. She did not move or open her eyes. ‘Mrs K,’ he said again, a little louder. She opened her eyes. She looked at him. She waited for him to speak. He hesitated, then said, ‘I think we should talk. There are some things I want to say to you. It’s important.’ She sat up slowly, adjusting her body to the shape of the chair. She looked at him with a mixture of curiosity and annoyance. ‘What is it now?’ she asked. He took a deep breath. ‘I want to go back to Earth,’ he said. Her eyes widened. She stared at him. She started to say something, then stopped. She looked away from him, out the window at the blue sky and the dead sea. She was silent for a long time. Then she said, ‘Why?’ He told her why. He spoke for a long time. He spoke of his loneliness, his boredom, his desire for a new life, his need for a future. He spoke of his love for Earth, his hatred for Mars, his wish to leave, his wish to live. He spoke of his dreams. He spoke of his fears. He spoke of his hopes. He spoke of his love for her. He spoke of his need for her. He spoke of his desire to be with her, to share a new life with her on Earth. He spoke of his wish to grow old with her, to die with her, on Earth. He spoke of his wish to be buried in Earth soil, not Martian sand. He spoke of his wish to see green fields, blue skies, white clouds, and flowing rivers. He spoke of his wish to hear the sound of rain, the sound of thunder, the sound of children laughing. He spoke of his wish to smell the smell of grass, the smell of flowers, the smell of life. He spoke of his wish to feel the touch of a gentle breeze, the touch of a warm sun, the touch of a loving hand. He spoke of his wish to taste the taste of fresh fruit, the taste of clear water, the taste of life. He spoke of his wish to live. He spoke of his wish to love. He spoke of his wish to be alive. He spoke of his wish to be human. He spoke of his wish to be free. He spoke of his wish to be himself. He spoke of his wish to be happy. He spoke of his wish to be young.

He spoke of his wish to be a law. He spoke of his wish to be a principle. He spoke of his wish to be a rule. He spoke of his wish to be an exception. He spoke of his wish to be a beginning. He spoke of his wish to be an end. He spoke of his wish to be a cycle. He spoke of his wish to be a line. He spoke of his wish to be a circle. He spoke of his wish to be a spiral. He spoke of his wish to be a square. He spoke of his wish to be a triangle. He spoke of his wish to be a point. He spoke of his wish to be a dimension. He spoke of his wish to be a reality.
