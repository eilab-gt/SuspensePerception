Here are my responses to the questions after reading the first paragraph:

**Question 1: To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Explanation:** The paragraph sets a scene and introduces the characters, but doesn't hint at any specific upcoming events that would cause anticipation, excitement, or anxiety.

**Question 2: To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?**

**Answer:** 3. Somewhat

**Explanation:**  The paragraph mentions that Old Henry and Phoebe's activities have become fewer and fewer, suggesting a past where they were more active. I'm curious to know more about their lives before this point.

**Question 3: To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 2. Slightly

**Explanation:** While the paragraph doesn't explicitly set up future events, the description of their simple lives and the mention of "the rest of life" as a "far-off dream" makes me wonder what might happen to them.

**Question 4: To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 1. No surprise

**Explanation:** The paragraph presents a fairly straightforward description of a simple life, nothing particularly surprising.

**Question 5: To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 2. Slight irony

**Explanation:** There's a slight irony in the statement that "All the rest of life is a far-off dream" while describing their simple, everyday existence. It suggests a disconnect between their limited world and the broader possibilities of life.
