Here are my responses to the questions after reading the first paragraph:

**Question 1: To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 3. Somewhat 

*There's a sense of melancholy and a hint of potential conflict in the description of Henry and Phoebe's situation. This makes me curious about how their relationship will unfold.*

**Question 2: To what extent do you want to learn more about past events (events which already occurred in the passage up to this point, or which occurred before the passage began)?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

*While the passage mentions the loss of chickens and the decline of the garden, I'm not particularly driven to learn more about those specific events at this point.*

**Question 3: To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?**

**Answer:** 5. Moderately

*The mention of Henry's moodiness and Phoebe's potential departure creates a sense of intrigue and makes me want to see how their dynamic plays out.*

**Question 4: To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 1. No surprise

*The information presented is fairly straightforward and doesn't contain any unexpected twists or turns.*

**Question 5: To what extent did you feel irony in relation to information or events in the passage?**

**Answer:** 2. Slight irony

*There's a slight irony in the fact that the property is so small that it's of no interest to the children, yet it's the source of conflict between Henry and Phoebe.*
