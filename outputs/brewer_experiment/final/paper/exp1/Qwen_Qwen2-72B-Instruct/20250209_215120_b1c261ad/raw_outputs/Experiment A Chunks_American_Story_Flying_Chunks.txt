The passage is filled with a stream of consciousness style that jumps from one image or idea to another without clear connection or narrative. This makes it difficult to anticipate or feel excited about events to come, as there is no clear direction or plot. The lack of context or continuity also means there is no particular desire to learn more about events yet to come. The surprise factor is high due to the unexpected juxtaposition of elements that do not typically coexist in a single narrative.
