The passage describes the narrator's thoughts on poverty, hunger, and the desire for basic necessities like food and the simple pleasures of reading. The contrast between the need for sustenance and the contemplation of death, juxtaposed with the seemingly mundane wish to read certain books again, creates a sense of irony. The narrator's desperation for work, even menial labor, to avoid starvation also adds to the anticipation of what might happen next. The surprise comes from the sudden realization of the narrator's dire situation and the stark contrast between his basic needs and his intellectual desires.
