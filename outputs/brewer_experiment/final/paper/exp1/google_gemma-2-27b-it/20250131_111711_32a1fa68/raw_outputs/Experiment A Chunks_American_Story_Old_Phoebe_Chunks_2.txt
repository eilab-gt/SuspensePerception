**Explanation:**

The passage sets a melancholic tone with the description of the decaying farm and the aging couple. The mention of children leaving and the parents being forgotten creates a sense of sadness and perhaps a hint of anticipation about what might have led to this situation.  The slightly surprising element is the stark contrast between the once-vibrant farm and its current state of decay. The irony lies in the idea of a family farm, traditionally a symbol of togetherness and prosperity, becoming a place of isolation and loss.
