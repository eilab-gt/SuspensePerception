Here are my responses to your questions after reading the fourth paragraph:

***Q1: "To what extent do you feel anticipation, excitement, or anxiety about events yet to come in the passage?"***

**5. Moderately**

The protagonist's vivid descriptions of the food he craves create a sense of longing and anticipation. However, the juxtaposition of this desire with his bleak outlook on life and his contemplation of death creates a complex mix of emotions.

**4. Neutral or Uncertain**

The protagonist's detached acceptance of his potential death and his willingness to consider the Salvation Army are somewhat surprising, but they also feel consistent with his earlier reflections on poverty and the meaninglessness of existence.
