However, I'm not particularly anxious or excited about what might happen next.

The glimpse into their nightly routine is slightly surprising, revealing a tender dependence despite their bickering.

**Q2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

**Q3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

Phoebe's death is a turning point, and the description of Henry's grief and isolation is poignant. The detail about him finding "no shadow of Phoebe" despite everything reminding him of her is particularly moving. I'm moderately anxious about how Henry will cope with his loss and very much want to know what this "change" that begins after five months entails. The slight surprise comes from the fact that Henry chooses to stay in the house despite offers of help, highlighting his deep attachment to Phoebe and their shared life.
