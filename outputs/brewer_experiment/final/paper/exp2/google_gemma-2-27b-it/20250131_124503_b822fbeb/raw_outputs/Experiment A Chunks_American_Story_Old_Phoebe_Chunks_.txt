The description of the farm's decline and the will's insignificance to the children reinforces the sense of isolation and stagnation. However, the glimpse into Henry and Phoebe's daily interactions, particularly their bickering and dependence on each other, adds a layer of complexity and poignancy. Henry's fear of Phoebe's death raises the stakes and makes me curious about how he will cope if she is gone. The passage hints at a deeper emotional vulnerability beneath Henry's gruff exterior.

5. Moderately

**Question 2: "To what extent do you want to learn more about events yet to come in the passage?"**

6. Very much

**Question 3: "To what extent did you feel surprised by any information or events in the passage?"**

**Reasoning:**

Phoebe's death is a significant turning point, and Henry's grief and isolation are palpable. The details about his attempts to cope, like reading and trying to farm, highlight his struggle to adjust to life without her. The mention of a "change" beginning after five months creates a sense of anticipation. I'm curious to see what this change entails and whether it will bring Henry solace or further hardship. The passage has shifted from a depiction of a simple, albeit melancholic, existence to a more emotionally charged narrative.
