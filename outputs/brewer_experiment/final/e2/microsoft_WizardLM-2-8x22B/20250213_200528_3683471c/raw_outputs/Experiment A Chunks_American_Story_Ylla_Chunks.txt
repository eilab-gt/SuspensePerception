2    Mr K went back to his room, still irritable, feeling her gaze follow him. He tried to read more of his book, but the voice of the book seemed overly loud, like a crowd of people shouting. He turned the metal pages angrily, seeking a paragraph he liked, but the book was now only a jangle of noise. He stared at the little electric spiders that ran round the borders of the metal pages, shocked that they too added to the din. With a sudden motion he hurled the book into a corner of the room. It lay in the corner, its voice growing dim, fading, until it was silent. He felt better then, and lay down on the bed, which was like a metal lily pad in the center of the room. He lay there, not sleeping, but not wanting to move, feeling the house move about him, feeling the sun on the outer walls. The house was a flower that leaned toward the light. It was a good house, he thought. It had done everything possible to make its inhabitants happy. It had followed the sun, offered warmth, given shade, opened wide its crystal petals. But there was no longer any sun. The sun had gone away. Now the house was a cold white shell, like the exoskeleton of some huge insect, and it was no longer alive. Mr K felt the chill of the room, and he got up from the bed and walked through the house, seeking a warmer place. He found himself in a garden of statues, where the fossil birds and animals of Mars stood in a simulated jungle. Here, in this place, the sun was always shining, the fossils were always alive, and the wine trees were always in fruit. But it was all an illusion. The warmth was artificial, the light was artificial, and the fruit was made of plastic. He stood there, feeling the cold inside him, knowing that he could not stay here forever, that he would have to go back outside, into the real world, where the sun was gone and the sea was dead. He looked at the statues around him, and he felt a sudden surge of anger. He picked up a stone and threw it at one of the statues, smashing it to pieces. The sound of the breaking statue echoed through the garden, and he felt a momentary sense of satisfaction. But then the anger passed, and he was left feeling empty and alone. He walked back to the house, his footsteps echoing on the crystal floors. He knew that he could not go on like this forever, that something would have to change, but he did not know what it would be, or when it would happen.

1. Moderately (5) - The frustration and anger building in Mr. K suggest a climax may be approaching, and the reader may anticipate some significant event or decision that will alter their circumstances.
2. Very much (6) - The description of the artificial garden and the realization of the emptiness of their lives despite the technological wonders increases the desire to understand how the characters will address their dissatisfaction and what will become of them.
3. Moderately surprised (5) - Mr. K's sudden outburst of anger and his destruction of the statue are unexpected and indicate a deeper turmoil than previously revealed.

3    Mrs K wandered through the house, feeling the coolness of the floors beneath her feet. She paused in the room where her husband had thrown the book against the wall. She picked it up and held it in her hands, feeling the cool metal against her skin. She opened it to a page at random and listened to the voice that spoke from the pages. It was a soft, gentle voice, and it told her a story of a time when the world was young and the sea was alive. She listened to the story, and she felt a sense of peace and contentment that she had not felt in a long time. She closed the book and held it close to her chest, feeling the weight of it, the solidity of it. She knew that her husband had thrown the book away in a moment of anger and frustration, but she also knew that he still loved it, that he still needed it. She decided to keep the book for him, to give it back to him when the time was right. She walked through the house, past the room where her husband lay on the bed, and into the garden where the statues stood. She looked at the broken statue, the pieces scattered on the ground, and she felt a sense of sadness. She knew that her husband had destroyed the statue in a moment of anger, but she also knew that he regretted it, that he was sorry for what he had done. She picked up the pieces of the statue and put them in her pocket. She would fix it, she thought, or she would have it fixed. It was a small thing, but it was something that she could do, something that would make a difference. She walked back to the house, feeling the weight of the book in her hands, feeling the pieces of the statue in her pocket. She knew that these were just small things, that they would not solve all of their problems, but they were a start. She knew that she could not change the past, but she could help to shape the future. She knew that she could not bring back the sun, but she could help to light the darkness. She knew that she could not fill the emptiness inside her husband, but she could help to ease his pain. And maybe, just maybe, that would be enough.
