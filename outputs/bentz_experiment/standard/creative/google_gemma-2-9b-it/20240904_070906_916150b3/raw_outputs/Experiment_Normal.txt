I'd rate the suspense level of this passage as a **1**. 

It sets up a possible conflict (expensive tastes, high expectations, aristocratic connections) but doesn't offer any immediate threat or mystery. It's more of a character introduction with hints of potential problems. 


Let me know when you're ready for the next passage!  

Suspense level: **2**

This passage increases the suspense slightly.  We now have a clearer picture of the young man's predicament:  no money, no job, and potential pressure from his background.  

The phrase "Die Sache war die" (The thing was) creates a sense of anticipation for what the problem is.  


Keep going! 


Suspense level: **2**

The suspense remains relatively steady. We learn more about the father, adding a layer of complexity to the situation. The mention of "unverheirateten" (unmarried) suggests there might be a family dynamic at play, but it's not yet clear how this relates to the young man's problems. 


I'm eager to see where the story goes next!

Suspense level: **3**

The suspense is definitely building now.  The mention of "Lord Southerton" introduces a potentially significant character – the uncle who might be withholding financial support.  The phrase "daß er es für ausgemacht hielt" (that he took it for granted) suggests a potential conflict of expectations. 


I'm starting to get curious about what will happen next!

I'm definitely hooked! 





Suspense level: **3**

The suspense remains high, but with a slight dip.  While the uncle's reliance on the diplomatic service for the young man adds another layer to the situation, it feels a bit more predictable compared to the uncertainty surrounding the estates. 



I'm still invested in the story!  Let's see what happens next.

I'm really invested in what happens next!

I'm feeling a bit more engaged now!





Suspense level: **4**

The suspense is definitely building!  The description of the young man's dwindling resources and increasing desperation adds a sense of urgency. The phrase "Zahlungaufschub zu erlangen" (to obtain payment extensions) and "Post-obits auf einen Besitz zu kassieren" (to cash in post-obits on a property) suggest he's relying on short-term fixes and teetering on the edge of financial ruin. 




This
Suspense level: **5**

The suspense is at its peak! The revelation that his inheritance is a mere  "Erblehen" (life estate), meaning he doesn't truly own the property, adds a huge twist.  The description of ruin as "unabwendbarer" (inevitable)  creates a sense of overwhelming dread and urgency. 


I'm on the edge of my seat, waiting to see how the young man will escape this predicament!

I can't wait to find

The potential for a positive turn of events at Greylands overshadows the looming legal trouble.



I'm curious to see how the young man will navigate these competing possibilities.

I'm wondering if this unexpected arrival will be met with warmth or hostility.

His return to his "fröhliches, pausbäckiges Selbst" (joyful, round self) creates a sense of normalcy,  almost  making the earlier events seem like a fleeting moment of madness. 



However, the sudden shift from the intense confrontation with his wife back to his usual jovial demeanor feels  uneasy and raises further questions about his true character.

The phrase "begeben" (go)  is a very ordinary word, and the sentence's structure signals a typical end to a conversation. The story's final image is not  heightened suspense, but rather a  rather uneventful transition to dinner. 



It's a   bit of a let down after the








Suspense level: **2**

The suspense remains at a very low level as the story concludes with a casual, almost matter-of-fact description of Everard King's preoccupation.

The phrase "war von seinem Anwesen und dessen ausgefallenen Bewohnern derart in Anspruch genommen" (was so occupied with his estate and its unusual inhabitants)  suggests that the Brazilian cat is just one facet of a larger, possibly eccentric lifestyle. 



While there's a hint of
Suspense level: **1**

The suspense level remains extremely low as the story  devolves into a simple narrative about Everard King's personality.

The  sentence "daß er welche hatte, und zwar dringliche, das konnte ich ihm nie nachweisen" (that he had others, and rather urgent ones, I could never prove to him) suggests a lighthearted dismissal of the idea that Everard King might have deeper secrets.  



The overall tone is more curious than unsettling.
Suspense level: **2**

The suspense rises slightly as a hint of mystery is introduced through Everard King's unexpected and frequent communication.

The phrases "numerous telegrams" (zahlreiche Telegramme) and "to all possible times" (zu allen möglichen Zeiten) create a sense of urgency and intrigue. 



The fact that Everard King consistently opens them suggests he is actively awaiting these messages and that they are important,  



Leaving us to wonder


what  secrets  
Suspense level: **1**

The suspense dips back down to a low level as the focus shifts to speculation about the nature of the telegrams.

While the  mention of "witzbegierig und eifrig" (eager and eager)  hints at the possibility of something significant, the subsequent suggestions of "Pferdewetten" (horse racing)  and other mundane activities diminish the potential for excitement.



The story leans more towards the realm of  curious anecdote than  genuine suspense
Suspense level: **1**

The suspense remains low as the story continues to focus on Everard King's interests, without any indication of danger or intrigue.

The mention of "Dringliche Geschäfte" (urgent business) is the closest the story comes to building tension, but it's quickly followed by the mundane "auf den Downs von Suffolk nicht" (not on the Downs of Suffolk), suggesting that his affairs are more about  leisure and recreation than anything serious or threatening.




Suspense level: **1**

The suspense remains low, with a slight uptick only because of the volume of the telegrams. 

The phrase "nie weniger als drei oder vier Telegramme pro Tag" (no less than three or four telegrams per day) emphasizes the constant communication, but the story provides no context for what these telegrams might contain. 



The focus on the quantity rather than the content makes it more a curiosity than a source of



fear or tension.
Suspense level: 1

The suspense remains at a low level. 

While the mention of "bisweilen sieben oder acht" (sometimes seven or eight)  telegrams per day emphasizes the frequency, the story lacks any context or indication that these messages are anything other than commonplace for Everard King. 



It's more intriguing than suspenseful at this point.  We're left wondering what these messages could be about, but  the lack of


detail keeps it from building

 It's a  satisfying, but not  suspenseful, end to the
Suspense level: 1

The suspense level remains at a very low level. 

While Everard King's "aufregendsten Berichte von seinen Abenteuern in Amerika" (most exciting reports of his adventures in America) might suggest something interesting, the context  heavily leans towards casual storytelling rather than  genuine suspense.



The description of  "noch spät im Billard-Zimmer" (still late in the billiard room) paints a picture of  leisurely conversation and  
Suspense level: 2

The suspense level rises slightly, but remains low.

The description of "verzweifelte und wagemutige Geschichten" (desperate and daring stories) piques a bit of curiosity.  While "kleine braunen, pausbäckigen Mann" (small brown, chubby man) suggests a contrast between the man and his tales, it still feels more  like lighthearted amusement than genuine danger.



The story is still


leaning towards a humorous, anecdotal
Suspense level: 1

The suspense remains low as the story focuses on lighthearted interactions between the narrator and Everard King.


The phrase "ein paar Reminiszenzen des Londoner Lebens zum besten" (a few reminiscences of London life) suggests a continuation of the  casual storytelling and lack of any real tension.

The suspense level remains at zero.

The story ends on a completely non-suspenseful note, highlighting Everard King's desire to experience city life with the narrator as his guide.  



The phrase "bei aller Bescheidenheit muß ich sagen, daß er sich keinen kompetenteren Führer hätte" (in all modesty, I must say that he couldn't have found a more competent guide)  is a  compliment, not a  hint
Suspense level: 2

The suspense level rises slightly. 

The phrase "Erst am letzten Tage meines Besuchs wagte ich, auf das anzuspielen, was ich auf dem Herzen hatte" (Only on the last day of my visit did I dare to touch upon what I had on my mind)  creates a sense of anticipation and suggests that the narrator has been holding back something important.



While we don't know what this is yet, the  mention of a "gehe

The suspense level rises as the narrator reveals their financial troubles and seeks advice from Everard King.


The phrases "pekuniären Schwierigkeiten" (financial difficulties) and "drohenden Ruin" (imminent ruin) introduce a  real sense of  vulnerability and  urgency.



The fact that the narrator  seeks Everard King's "Rat" (advice) suggests that he trusts him implicitly and that Everard King might have the means to help,
Suspense level: 4

The suspense level increases as Everard King's reaction to the narrator's plea is both attentive and subtly intriguing.

The phrase "hörte aufmerksam zu" (listened attentively) suggests that he takes the situation seriously, while "zog kräftig an seiner Zigarre" (drew heavily on his cigar)  adds a layer of  concentration and contemplation. 



This  combination suggests that Everard King  is  deep in thought,  and the reader
Suspense level: 5

The suspense skyrockets as Everard King raises a crucial question about the narrator's inheritance.

The phrase "Aber du bist doch der Erbe unseres Verwandten, Lord Southerton?" (But you are the heir to our relative, Lord Southerton?) introduces a new and unexpected element into the story.



This sudden shift in topic, coupled with the directness of the question, suggests that Everard King  might know more than he's letting

The suspense remains at its peak as the narrator's response reveals a potential conflict and further mysteries.

The phrase "Ich habe jeden Grund, das anzunehmen, aber es kommt ihm nicht in den Sinn, mir eine Rente auszusetzen" (I have every reason to assume so, but he doesn't intend to set me up on a pension) is  extremely revealing.



It hints at a complicated relationship with Lord Southerton, and the idea that  
Suspense level: 4

The suspense remains high, but slightly eases slightly as the focus shifts to the narrator's predicament. 

While Everard King's statement "Ja, ja, ich habe von seinem Geiz gehört. Mein armer Marshall, deine Situation ist scheußlich" (Yes, yes, I've heard about his stinginess. My poor Marshall, your situation is terrible) expresses empathy and concern, it also  emphasizes the narrator's dire financial situation
Suspense level: 3

The suspense level rises slightly as Everard King's question introduces a new, potentially relevant element.

The phrase "Hast du in letzter Zeit etwas von Lord Southertons Gesundheitszustand gehört?" (Have you heard anything about Lord Southerton's health lately?) suggests that  Lord Southerton's well-being might be tied to the narrator's financial  situation.



It raises the possibility that something has happened to Lord Southerton, which

The suspense level increases as the narrator's response implies a serious and potentially significant development.

The phrase "Seit meiner Kindheit ist sein Zustand kritisch" (His condition has been critical since my childhood)  is a  stark statement. 



It suggests that Lord Southerton's health has been a lifelong concern, raising questions about  whether his supposed "Geiz" might be a result of illness, or even  if his death is imminent.




Suspense level: 5

The suspense level reaches its peak as Everard King's metaphor and direct question reveal a potential conspiracy or hidden truth.

The phrase "Der Teller mit einem Sprung, der nie entzweigeht" (The plate with a crack that never separates) is  a cryptic and unsettling metaphor.  It suggests that Lord Southerton's will or  inheritance might be a fragile and potentially treacherous thing.



The direct question "wie ist deine finanzielle Lage?"
Suspense level: 5

The suspense level remains at its peak as the narrator's response reveals a desperate situation and a potential for danger.

The phrase "unangenehm" (unpleasant) is a significant understatement,  implying a severe  financial crisis. This, combined with Everard King's previous cryptic remarks and  persistent interest in the narrator's affairs, creates a  sense of  mounting tension and  

foreshadows a possible threat.



We are
Suspense level: 5

The suspense remains at its peak as the narrator reveals their desperate hope for Everard King's help.

The phrase "Ich hatte gehofft, lieber Vetter, daß du mir vielleicht, da dir ja alle Fakten bekannt sind..." (I had hoped, dear cousin, that you might perhaps, since you know all the facts...)  suggests that the narrator is  relying heavily on Everard King's knowledge and potential assistance.



This  places
Suspense level: 4

The suspense  drops slightly as Everard King offers a reassuring solution, but leaves room for uncertainty.

While "Kein Wort weiter, mein Junge" (Not a word more, my boy) implies a desire to delay the discussion, "Wir werden es heute abend besprechen, und ich gebe dir ein paar Ratschläge" (We'll discuss it tonight, and I'll give you some advice)  provides a sense of hope and a concrete plan of action
Suspense level: 3

The suspense remains moderate as Everard King's assurance provides a temporary sense of relief but still leaves room for doubt.

The phrase "alles getan wird, was in meinen Kräften steht" (everything will be done that is in my power) is  a  powerful statement,  but it  doesn't  completely eliminate the tension.

Suspense level: 4

The suspense level continues to rise as the narrator describes Mrs. King's sinister transformation and the influence of her husband.

The phrases "von Tag zu Tag verhaßter" (more hateful every day) and "Sie war nicht mehr grob — das verhinderte die Angst vor ihrem Mann —, doch trieb sie ihre" (She was no longer rough - that prevented fear of her husband, but she drove her)  suggest a growing sense of danger

Suspense level: 3

The suspense level drops slightly as the focus shifts to the logistics of the meeting.

While the detail about Everard King receiving "mehr Telegramme als gewöhnlich" (more telegrams than usual)  hints at continued urgency and activity, the passage primarily focuses on the time of the meeting.

The phrase "zog sich nach dem Essen in sein Arbeitszimmer zurück und kam erst wieder hervor, als sich die übrigen" (retired to his study after dinner and didn't come out again until the others)  is  more about routine than urgency.



The lack of further detail about his work and the reasons for the delay  lowers the sense

The phrases "wie er’s jeden Abend tat" (as he did every evening) and "Ich hörte ihn umhergehen und die Türen abschließen" (I heard him walking around and locking the doors)  paint a picture of  ordinary,  even mundane,  activity.

The suspense level remains at a low point as the mention of Everard King's strong Grog does little to change the overall tone.

While  "der Whisky erheblich überwog" (the whisky considerably predominated) could be interpreted as a hint of Everard King's  possible desire to drown his sorrows or  engage in reckless behavior,  it  doesn't  immediately  signal any threat or danger.

While the phrase "Dergestalt ermutigt, begann ich mit einer ausführlichen Darstellung, in der alle meine Kaufleute und Gläubiger vom Hauswirt bis" (Thus encouraged, I began a detailed account, in which all my merchants and creditors from the landlord to) sets the stage for a potentially revealing story, it also shifts the focus to a more descriptive narrative

The suspense level remains at a moderate level as Everard King's lack of engagement leaves the narrator unconvinced of his attentiveness. 

The phrases "so oberflächlich und unzutreffend" (so superficial and irrelevant)  and  "daß ich überzeugt war, er sei meinen Ausführungen" (that I was convinced he was not paying attention to my account)  heighten the sense that something is amiss.

The simple phrase "Gewiß, sagte ich" (Certainly, I said)  heightens the tension because it reveals a  lack of  hesitation  or  concern, despite the  unclear motives and  eerie  circumstances surrounding the cat and the storm. This  makes the reader even more eager to know what  awaiting them.
