I'd rate this passage a **7**.

The suspense remains high, but the introduction of a seemingly friendly and helpful driver adds a slight layer of relief. The fact that the telegram didn't arrive on time adds to the protagonist's misfortunes and raises questions about why Everard King didn't anticipate his arrival.

I'd rate this passage a **3**.

The suspense is minimal in this passage. It focuses on a descriptive detail about a bird, which serves as a brief pause in the narrative tension. The focus on the bird and the driver's explanation of its species distracts from the main plotline and the protagonist's impending encounter with Everard King.

I'd rate this passage a **2**.

The suspense is quite low in this passage. While it hints at a connection between the bird and Everard King, the focus remains on the bird itself and its identification. The phrase "Es schien, als sei die Akklimatisierung" ("It seemed as if the acclimatization")  is intriguing but doesn't immediately raise the stakes.

How will they interact with the protagonist? This adds

The
I'd rate this passage an **8**.

The suspense takes a slight dip, but it's still very high. The physical description of Everard King paints a picture of a relatively ordinary man.

However, the mention of his "braungebrannt von der tropischen Sonne" (tanned from the tropical sun)  is a reminder of his adventurous past and the exotic animals we just encountered. This juxtaposition keeps the reader guessing about his true nature and intentions.

I'd rate this passage a **4**. 

The suspense is relatively low in this passage.  The description of the house and the word "deplaziert" (out of place) create a sense of unease, but the focus is more on the contrast between the house and Everard King's past rather than on immediate danger. The reader is left wondering how these elements will connect and what role the house will play in the story.

The suspense picks up again.
