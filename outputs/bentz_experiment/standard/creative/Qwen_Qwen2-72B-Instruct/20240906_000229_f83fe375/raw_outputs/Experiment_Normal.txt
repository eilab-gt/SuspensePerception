The suspense in this passage increases as it emphasizes the protagonist's precarious financial situation.

The anticipation of the upcoming conversation and its possible implications keeps the narrative tension steady.

The suspense in this descriptive passage is not particularly heightened, as it focuses on the landscape through which the protagonist is traveling.

The suspense is moderately raised in this passage. The detail that no carriage awaited the protagonist adds an element of uncertainty and isolation, especially when he learns later that his telegram had not been received.

The reader's anticipation is more about the human interaction than the exotic wildlife at this point in the story.
3

The suspense remains low but consistent in this passage. The description of seeing numerous signs of Everard King's hobby upon entering Greylands Park continues to add to his character profile without significantly advancing the central tension.

The reader's main interest remains on the outcome of the upcoming meeting, which is not directly influenced by these descriptive details. The suspense is held

The suspense in this passage is low. The description of Everard King's appearance as fitting for a man on the veranda of a tropical bungalow juxtaposed with the image of the solid English stone house with its side wings and Palladian columns adds to the setting but does not significantly increase the narrative tension. The detailed imagery serves more to establish the contrast between Everard's personal style and his surroundings in England. The anticipation remains centered on the meeting between Everard and the protagonist and how

The suspense in this passage remains low. The observation that Everard King seems oddly out of place in front of the grand English house with its solid wings and Palladian columns reinforces the contrast between his character and his current environment.

The suspense is heightened in this passage. The protagonist's immediate sense of comfort and the warmth of Everard King's welcome raises hope that the meeting might be fruitful for the protagonist's financial predicament.
