**Explanation:**

* **Sadness:** The poem evokes a sense of loss, decay, and the extinguishing of light and knowledge. Words like "fades," "expires," "dies," and "buried" contribute to this feeling.
* **Uneasiness:** The poem also creates a sense of unease and foreboding. The imagery of darkness, chaos, and the suppression of truth and reason contribute to this.
* **Awe/Sublime:** The power of Chaos and the overwhelming nature of the darkness are presented in a way that can be awe-inspiring, even if tinged with fear.
