 To annotate the given stanza, I will follow the guidelines provided and label the emotions that I experience while reading it.

Stanza:
In vain, in vain — the all-composing Hour
Resistless falls : the Muse obeys the Pow"r .
She comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold
Of Night primæval and of Chaos old!

Before her, Fancy's gilded clouds decay,
And all its varying Rain-bows die away.
Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires,
The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.

As one by one, at dread Medea's strain,
The sick'ning stars fade off the ethereal plain;
As Argus' eyes by Hermes' wand oppressed,
Closed one by one to everlasting rest;

Thus at her felt approach, and secret might,
Art after Art goes out, and all is Night.
See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,
Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head!

Philosophy, that lean'd on Heaven before,
Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.
Physic of Metaphysic begs defense,
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense!

See Mystery to Mathematics fly!
In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.
Religion blushing veils her sacred fires,
And unawares Morality expires.

For public Flame, nor private, dares to shine;
Nor human Spark is left, nor Glimpse divine!
Lo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restor'd;
Light dies before thy uncreating word;
Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall,
And universal Darkness buries All.

Explanation:
The stanza describes the fall of various forms of art, knowledge, and morality in the face of chaos and darkness. This depiction of chaos and the fall of established systems creates a sense of uneasiness and unsettling feelings. The stanza also sparks my interest as it presents a dramatic and apocalyptic scene. The use of words like "all-composing Hour," "Night primæval and of Chaos old," and "universal Darkness" adds to the sense of awe and greatness. However, the overall tone of the stanza is predominantly one of uneasiness.
