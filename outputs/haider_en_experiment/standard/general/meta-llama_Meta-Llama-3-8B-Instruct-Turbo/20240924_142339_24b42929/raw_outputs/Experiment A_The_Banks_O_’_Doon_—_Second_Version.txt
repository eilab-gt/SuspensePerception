Based on the guidelines and examples provided, I will annotate the stanza below:

Ye flowery banks o’ bonie Doon,
How can ye blume sae fair ?
How can ye chant, ye little birds,
And I sae fu’ o’ care !

* Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)

Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
That sings upon the bough !
Thou minds me o’ the happy days
When my fause Luve was true .

* Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) + Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)

Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
That sings beside thy mate ;
For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
And wist na o’ my fate .

* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)

Note: I have used the label "Beauty/Joy" for the first four lines, as they evoke a sense of wonder and appreciation for nature. The next four lines evoke a sense of nostalgia and sadness, as the speaker reflects on past happiness and lost love.
Based on the guidelines and examples provided, I will annotate the stanza below:

Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon,
To see the woodbine twine ;
And ilka bird sang o' its Luve,
And sae did I o' mine .

* Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)

Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose,
Upon its thorny tree ;
But my fause Luver staw my rose,
And left the thorn wi' me .

* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)

Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose,
Upon a morn in June ;
And sae I flourished on the morn,
And sae was pu'd or noon .

* Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) + Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)

Note: I have used the label "Beauty/Joy" for the first two lines, as they evoke a sense of wonder and appreciation for nature. The next two lines evoke a sense of sadness and loss, as the speaker's lover has taken away the rose and left the thorn. The final two lines evoke a sense of nostalgia and longing, as the speaker reflects on the past and the fleeting nature of beauty.
