I'll annotate the stanza according to the guidelines provided. Here's the annotation:

I met a traveller from an antique land [Vitality]
Who said : Two vast and trunkless legs of stone [Vitality]
Stand in the desert ... Near them , on the sand , [Vitality]
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown , [Uneasiness]
And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , [Uneasiness]
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read [Vitality]
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things , [Vitality]
The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed : [Vitality]
And on the pedestal these words appear : [Vitality]
‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings : [Vitality]
Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! ’ [Vitality]
Nothing beside remains . [Uneasiness]
Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare [Uneasiness]
The lone and level sands stretch far away . [Uneasiness]

Here's the breakdown:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of Vitality, as the speaker describes the imposing and awe-inspiring statue of Ozymandias.
* The lines "Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown , / And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , " evoke a sense of Uneasiness, as the speaker describes the decaying and unsettling appearance of the statue.
* The lines "Tell that its sculptor well those passions read / Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things , / The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed : " evoke a sense of Vitality, as the speaker describes the enduring power of the sculptor's art.
* The lines "And on the pedestal these words appear : / ‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings : / Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! ’" evoke a sense of Vitality, as the speaker describes the boastful and arrogant inscription on the pedestal.
* The final lines "Nothing beside remains . / Round the decay / Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away . " evoke a sense of Uneasiness, as the speaker describes the desolate and abandoned landscape surrounding the statue.

Note that I've used a combination of labels to capture the complex emotions evoked by the poem.
