Here is the annotation of the stanza:

My heart leaps up when I behold [Vitality]
A rainbow in the sky: [Vitality]
So was it when my life began; [Vitality]
So is it now I am a man; [Vitality]
So be it when I shall grow old, [Vitality]
Or let me die! [Vitality]
The Child is father of the Man; [Vitality]
And I could wish my days to be [Vitality]
Bound each to each by natural piety.

All lines evoke a sense of vitality, energy, and joy. The speaker's heart leaps up, and they express a sense of connection to their childhood and their future. The use of the word "leaps" and the exclamation "Or let me die!" also convey a sense of exuberance and enthusiasm.
