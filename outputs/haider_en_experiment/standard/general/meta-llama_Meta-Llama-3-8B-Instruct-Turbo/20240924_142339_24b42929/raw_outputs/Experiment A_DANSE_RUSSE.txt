Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza below:

If I when my wife is sleeping
and the baby and Kathleen
are sleeping
and the sun is a flame-white disc
in silken mists above shining trees ,—
if I in my north room
danse naked , grotesquely
before my mirror
waving my shirt round my head
and singing softly to myself :
“I am lonely, lonely.
I was born to be lonely .
I am best so !”
