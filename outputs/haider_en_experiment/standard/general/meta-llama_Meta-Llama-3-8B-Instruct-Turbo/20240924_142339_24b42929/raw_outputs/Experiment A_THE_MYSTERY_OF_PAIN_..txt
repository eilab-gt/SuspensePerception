Here is the annotation for the given stanza:

Pain has an element of blank ;
[Annoyance]
It cannot recollect
[Annoyance]
When it began , or if there were
[Annoyance]
A day when it was not .

I chose the label "Annoyance" for each line because the pain described in the stanza seems to be a constant and inescapable presence, which can evoke feelings of frustration and discomfort. The use of the word "blank" to describe the element of pain adds to the sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, which can also contribute to feelings of annoyance.
Here is the annotation for the given stanza:

It has no future but itself , [Annoyance]
Its infinite realms contain [Annoyance]
Its past , enlightened to perceive [Annoyance]
New periods of pain .

I chose the label "Annoyance" for each line because the poem's focus on the present moment and the inevitability of pain in the future can evoke feelings of frustration and discomfort. The use of words like "no future" and "new periods of pain" creates a sense of inevitability and helplessness, which can contribute to feelings of annoyance.
