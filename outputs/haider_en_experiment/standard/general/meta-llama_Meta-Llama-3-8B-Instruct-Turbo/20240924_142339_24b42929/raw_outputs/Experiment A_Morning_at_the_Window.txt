Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the stanza:

They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens ,
And along the trampled edges of the street
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
Sprouting despondently at area gates .

• Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
• Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)

The stanza evokes feelings of sadness and uneasiness in me. The image of the housemaids' "damp souls" and their despondent state creates a sense of melancholy and hopelessness. The use of words like "trampled" and "damp" also adds to the sense of uneasiness and discomfort.
Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the stanza:

The brown waves of fog toss up to me
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street ,
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts
An aimless smile that hovers in the air
And vanishes along the level of the roofs .

• Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
• Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)

The stanza evokes feelings of sadness and uneasiness in me. The image of "twisted faces" and "muddy skirts" creates a sense of discomfort and unease. The use of words like "aimless" and "vanishes" also adds to the sense of sadness and loss.
