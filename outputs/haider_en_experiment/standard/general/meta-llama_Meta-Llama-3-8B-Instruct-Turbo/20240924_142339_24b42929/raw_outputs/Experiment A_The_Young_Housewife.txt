Here is the annotated stanza:

AT ten A.M. the young housewife
moves about in negligee behind
the wooden walls of her husband"s house. [Beauty/Joy]
I pass solitary in my car. [Vitality]
Then again she comes to the curb
to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
shy, uncorseted, tucking in
stray ends of hair, and I compare her
to a fallen leaf. [Sadness]
The noiseless wheels of my car
rush with a crackling sound over
dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling. [Vitality]
