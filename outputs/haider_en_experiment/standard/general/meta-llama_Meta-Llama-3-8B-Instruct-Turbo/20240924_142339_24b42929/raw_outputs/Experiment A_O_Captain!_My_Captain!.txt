O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, [Sadness]
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, [Vitality]

While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; [Vitality]

Fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]

Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, [Vitality]

You’ve fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, [Sadness]
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, [Sadness]

From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; [Vitality]

Walk the deck my Captain lies, [Sadness]
Fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]
