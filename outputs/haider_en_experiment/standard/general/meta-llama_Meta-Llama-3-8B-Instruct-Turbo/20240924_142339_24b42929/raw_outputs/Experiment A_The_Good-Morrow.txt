I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I [Beauty/Joy]
Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then? [Sadness]
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly? [Vitality]
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den? [Suspense]

If ever any beauty I did see, [Beauty/Joy]
Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee. [Sadness]

My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears, [Beauty/Joy]
thine in mine eye, [Beauty/Joy]
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; [Beauty/Joy]

Without sharp north, without declining west? [Vitality]

Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die. [Beauty/Joy]
