Here is the annotation of the stanza:

OLD age is
• Annoyance (found it frustrating)
a flight of small
• Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful)
cheeping birds
• Vitality (found it invigorating)
skimming
• Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful)
bare trees above a snow glaze.
Gaining and failing
• Uneasiness (found it unsettling)
they are buffeted
• Uneasiness (found it unsettling)
by a dark wind--
• Suspense (found it gripping)
But what?
On harsh weedstalks
• Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful)
the flock has rested,
• Vitality (found it invigorating)
the snow
• Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful)
is covered with broken
• Uneasiness (found it unsettling)
seedhusks
• Uneasiness (found it unsettling)
and the wind tempered
• Vitality (found it invigorating)
by a shrill
• Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful)
piping of plenty.
