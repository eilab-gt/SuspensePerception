Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza:

A noiseless patient spider ,
I mark "d where on a little promontory it stood isolated ,
Mark "d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding ,
It launch "d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself ,
Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them .

* A noiseless patient spider: Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
* I mark "d where on a little promontory it stood isolated: Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
* Mark "d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding: Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
* It launch "d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself: Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)
* Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them: Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

Note: I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" for the first two lines because they evoke a sense of wonder and appreciation for the spider's actions. The label "Suspense" for the third line because it creates a sense of curiosity and anticipation. The label "Vitality" for the last two lines because they convey a sense of energy and movement.
Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza:

And you O my soul where you stand ,
Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space ,
Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to
connect them ,
Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold ,
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul .

* And you O my soul where you stand: Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)

* Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold: Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
* Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul: Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)

Note: I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" for the first and last lines because they evoke a sense of wonder and appreciation for the soul's journey. The label "Awe/Sublime" for the second line because it creates a sense of vastness and awe. The label "Vitality" for the third line because it conveys a sense of energy and movement. The label "Suspense" for the fourth line because it creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty.
