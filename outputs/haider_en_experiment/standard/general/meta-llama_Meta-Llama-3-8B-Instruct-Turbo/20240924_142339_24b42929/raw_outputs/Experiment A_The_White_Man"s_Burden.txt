Here is the annotated stanza:

TAKE up the White Man"s burden -
Send forth the best ye breed -
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives" need;
To wait in heavy harness [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
On fluttered folk and wild -
Your new-caught sullen peoples,
Half devil and half child.
Take up the White Man"s burden -
In patience to abide
To veil the threat of terror
And check the show of pride;

An hundred times made plain,
To seek another"s profit,
And work another"s gain.
