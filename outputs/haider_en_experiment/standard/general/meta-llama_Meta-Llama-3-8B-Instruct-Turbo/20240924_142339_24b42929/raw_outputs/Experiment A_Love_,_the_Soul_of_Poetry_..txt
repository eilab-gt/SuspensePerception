When first Alexis did in Verse delight ,
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
His Muse in Low , but Graceful Numbers walk"t ,
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
And now and then a little Proudly stalk"t ;
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
But never aim "d at any noble Flight :
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
The Herds , the Groves , the gentle purling Streams ,
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
Adorn "d his Song , and were his highest Theams .

But Love these Thoughts , like Mists , did soon disperse ,
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
Enlarg "d his Fancy , and set free his Muse ,
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
Biding him more Illustrious Subjects choose ;
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
The Acts of Gods , and God-like Men reherse .
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
From thence new Raptures did his Breast inspire ,
[Vitality] (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)
His scarce Warm-Heart converted was to Fire .

Th' exalted Poet rais'd by this new Flame ,
[Beauty/Joy] (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)

And Acts Divine, in a Diviner Song ,
