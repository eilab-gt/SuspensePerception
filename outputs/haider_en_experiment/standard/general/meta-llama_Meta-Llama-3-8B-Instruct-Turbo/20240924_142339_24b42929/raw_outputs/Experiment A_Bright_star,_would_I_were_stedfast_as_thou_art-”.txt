Here is the annotation of the stanza:

Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite,

* Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)

The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores,

* Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)

Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—

* Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)

No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,

* Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)

Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,

* Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)

To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,

* Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)

Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,

* Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,

* Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)

And so live ever—or else swoon to death.

* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
