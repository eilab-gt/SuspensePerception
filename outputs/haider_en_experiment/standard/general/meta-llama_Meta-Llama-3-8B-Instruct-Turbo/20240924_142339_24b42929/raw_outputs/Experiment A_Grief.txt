Here is the annotation of the stanza:

1. I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
2. That only men incredulous of despair,
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
3. Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
	* Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
4. Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access
	* Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
5. Of shrieking and reproach.
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
6. Full desertness,
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
8. Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare
	* Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Of the absolute heavens.
	* Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
10. Deep-hearted man, express
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
11. Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
12. Most like a monumental statue set
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
13. In everlasting watch and moveless woe
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
14. Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
15. Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
16. If it could weep, it could arise and go.
	* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
