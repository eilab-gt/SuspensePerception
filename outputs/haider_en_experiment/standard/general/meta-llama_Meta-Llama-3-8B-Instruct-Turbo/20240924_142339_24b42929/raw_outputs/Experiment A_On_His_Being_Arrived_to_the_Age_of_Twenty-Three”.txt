Here is the annotated stanza:

HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, [Sadness]
Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year! [Sadness]
My hasting days fly on with full career, [Vitality]
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th. [Sadness]
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, [Annoyance]
That I to manhood am arrived so near, [Sadness]
And inward ripeness doth much less appear, [Sadness]
That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th. [Sadness]
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, [Vitality]
It shall be still in strictest measure even [Vitality]
To that same lot, however mean or high, [Vitality]
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven, [Sadness]
All is, if I have grace to use it so, [Annoyance]
As ever in my great Task-master’s eye [Sadness]

Note: I used the following labels:

* Sadness: 6 times (lines 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)
* Vitality: 3 times (lines 4, 7, 10)
* Annoyance: 2 times (lines 5, 12)

I chose these labels based on the emotions evoked by the poem, such as a sense of loss and longing (Sadness), a sense of energy and movement (Vitality), and a sense of frustration and disappointment (Annoyance).
