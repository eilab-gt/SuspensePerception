Note: The use of the word "Idol" in the last line adds a sense of uneasiness and discomfort, but it is not strong enough to warrant a separate label.
Based on the guidelines and the provided examples, I will annotate the stanza:

Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar , [Annoyance]
What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ? [Annoyance]
If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray , [Sadness]
Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ? [Sadness]
Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find , [Uneasiness]
Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind . [Annoyance]

The final line, which speaks of a "strange unheard-of Judgement", creates a sense of uneasiness and discomfort.

Note: The use of the word "Wretch" in the first line adds a sense of disdain and contempt, which reinforces the "Annoyance" label.
