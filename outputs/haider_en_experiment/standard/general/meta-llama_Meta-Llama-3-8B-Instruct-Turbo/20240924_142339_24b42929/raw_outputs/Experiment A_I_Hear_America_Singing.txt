Here is the annotated stanza:

I hear America singing , the varied carols I hear , [Beauty/Joy]
Those of mechanics , each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong , [Vitality]
The carpenter singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work , [Vitality]
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work , [Vitality]
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat , the deckhand [Vitality]
singing on the steamboat deck , [Vitality]
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench , the hatter singing as he stands , [Vitality]
The wood-cutter "s song , the ploughboy "s on his way in the morning , or at noon intermission or at sundown , [Vitality]
The delicious singing of the mother , or of the young wife at work , or of the girl sewing or washing , [Beauty/Joy]
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else , [Vitality]
The day what belongs to the day â€” at night the party of young fellows , robust , friendly , [Vitality]
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs . [Vitality]
