Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza:

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.

* Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza:

How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?

* Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
* Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)

Note: The use of words like "terrified", "vague", "loosening", and "strange" creates an atmosphere of uneasiness and uncertainty, which is reflected in the annotation. The image of the body laid in a white rush and the heart beating where it lies also sparks curiosity and suspense, making it difficult to predict what will happen next.
Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza:

A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead. Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?

* Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
* Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)

Note: The use of words like "shudder", "broken", "burning", and "brute blood" creates an atmosphere of uneasiness and discomfort. The image of Agamemnon dead and the description of the woman being mastered by the air also sparks curiosity and suspense, making it difficult to predict what will happen next.
