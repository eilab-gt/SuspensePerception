Here is the annotation of the stanza:

Let the world "s sharpness , like a clasping knife , [Uneasiness]
Shut in upon itself and do no harm [Vitality]
In this close hand of Love , now soft and warm , [Beauty/Joy]
And let us hear no sound of human strife [Sadness]
After the click of the shutting . Life to life â€” [Vitality]
I lean upon thee , Dear , without alarm , [Vitality]
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm [Vitality]
Against the stab of worldlings , who if rife [Uneasiness]
Are weak to injure . Very-whitely still [Beauty/Joy]
The lilies of our lives may reassure [Beauty/Joy]
Their blossoms from their roots , accessible [Beauty/Joy]
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer [Beauty/Joy]
Growing straight , out of man "s reach , on the hill . [Vitality]
God only , who made us rich , can make us poor . [Vitality]
