To their haven under the hill ; [Vitality]

The use of the word "vanish'd" suggests something that has been lost or gone, which adds to the sense of sadness.

For the fourth line, I have chosen the label "Vitality" because the phrase "sound of a voice that is still" creates a sense of yearning and nostalgia, which is characteristic of the "Vitality" emotion. The use of the word "still" suggests a sense of quiet and calm, which adds to the sense of longing and nostalgia.

Note that I have chosen to label the third and fourth lines with both "Sadness" and "Vitality" because they both evoke a sense of emotional complexity and nuance.
