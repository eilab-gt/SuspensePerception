To annotate the given stanza, I will go through each line and apply the guidelines.

1. AT ten A.M. the young housewife
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

2. moves about in negligee behind
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

3. the wooden walls of her husband's house.
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

4. I pass solitary in my car.
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

5. Then again she comes to the curb
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

6. to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

7. shy, uncorseted, tucking in
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

8. stray ends of hair, and I compare her
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

9. to a fallen leaf.
- This line might evoke a sense of nostalgia, but it's not a strong emotion. However, it could be associated with sadness or beauty/joy. Since it's a comparison, I will label it with nostalgia and beauty/joy.

10. The noiseless wheels of my car
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

11. rush with a crackling sound over
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

12. dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling.
- This line does not evoke any strong emotions. It's a simple statement, so I will not label it with any emotion.

However, considering the overall context of the poem, I would say that the dominant emotion is beauty/joy, as the speaker is describing a serene and peaceful scene. The comparison of the young housewife to a fallen leaf also adds a sense of nostalgia and beauty.
