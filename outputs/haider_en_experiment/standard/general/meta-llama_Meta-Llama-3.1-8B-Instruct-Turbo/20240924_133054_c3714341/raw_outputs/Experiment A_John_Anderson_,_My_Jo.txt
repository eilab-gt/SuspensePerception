John Anderson , my jo , John , [Beauty/Joy]

John Anderson , my jo . [Beauty/Joy]

The dominant emotion in this stanza is Beauty/Joy, as it evokes a sense of nostalgia and fond memories of the past. The speaker is reminiscing about John Anderson's youth and beauty, which is why I have chosen Beauty/Joy for most of the lines. However, the lines "But now your brow is beld, John," and "Your locks are like the snaw" evoke a sense of sadness, as they describe the passing of time and the loss of youth.
