Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens , [Uneasiness]
And along the trampled edges of the street [Uneasiness]
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Sprouting despondently at area gates . [Sadness] [Uneasiness]

My reasoning:

- The phrase "rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens" creates an image of a mundane, possibly unpleasant atmosphere, which aligns with the label "Uneasiness".
- The line "along the trampled edges of the street" also contributes to a sense of unease and discomfort.
- The phrase "damp souls of housemaids" evokes feelings of sadness and possibly a sense of pity, which aligns with the label "Sadness". The word "damp" also adds to the overall sense of unease, so I've added "Uneasiness" as well.
- The phrase "Sprouting despondently at area gates" reinforces the sense of sadness and unease, so I've added both "Sadness" and "Uneasiness" to this line.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

The brown waves of fog toss up to me [Uneasiness]
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street , [Uneasiness]
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts [Uneasiness]
An aimless smile that hovers in the air [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
And vanishes along the level of the roofs . [Sadness] [Uneasiness]

My reasoning:

- The phrase "brown waves of fog toss up to me" creates an image of a gloomy and possibly unsettling atmosphere, which aligns with the label "Uneasiness".
- The line "Twisted faces from the bottom of the street" reinforces the sense of unease, as the word "twisted" implies something unpleasant or disturbing.
- The phrase "tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts" suggests a sense of sadness and possibly discomfort, but the dominant emotion is still uneasiness.
- The phrase "An aimless smile that hovers in the air" is a bit more ambiguous, but the word "aimless" implies a sense of sadness or melancholy, so I've added "Sadness" as a secondary label. The overall atmosphere of the line still feels unsettling, so I've kept "Uneasiness" as the primary label.
- The final line "And vanishes along the level of the roofs" reinforces the sense of uneasiness and possibly sadness, as the image of something vanishing into nothingness can be melancholic.
