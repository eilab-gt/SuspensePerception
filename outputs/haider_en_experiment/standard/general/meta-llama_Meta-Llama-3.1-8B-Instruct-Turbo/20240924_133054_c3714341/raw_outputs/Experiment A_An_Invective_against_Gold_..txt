Of all the Poisons that the fruitful Earth (Annoyance) 
E"er yet brought forth , or Monsters she gave Birth , (Annoyance)
Nought to Mankind has e"er so fatal been , (Annoyance)
As thou , accursed Gold , their Care and Sin . (Annoyance)

I have chosen the label "Annoyance" for each line because the stanza evokes a sense of frustration and anger towards the destructive power of gold. The speaker seems to be lamenting the negative impact of gold on humanity, which is why the dominant emotion is annoyance.

( His real Wealth ) while he , a Slave to th ’ Wind , (Annoyance)
Sometimes becalm "d , the Shore with longing Eyes (Annoyance)
Wishes to see , and what he wishes , Spies : (Annoyance)
For a rude Tempest wakes him from his Dream , (Annoyance)
And Strands his Bark by a more sad Extream . (Annoyance)
Thus , hopless Wretch , is his whole Life-time spent , (Annoyance)
And though thrice Wreck"t , ‘ s no Wiser than he went . (Annoyance)

Here's the annotated stanza:

Again , I see , the Heavenly Fair despis "d , (Annoyance)
A Hagg like Hell , with Gold , more highly priz "d ; (Annoyance)
Mens Faith betray "d , their Prince and Country Sold , (Annoyance)
Their God deny "d , all for the Idol Gold . (Annoyance)

I have chosen the label "Annoyance" for each line because the stanza evokes a sense of frustration and anger towards the betrayal of faith and the idolization of gold. The speaker seems to be lamenting the corruption and moral decay, which is why the dominant emotion is annoyance.

However, upon re-reading the stanza, I notice that the phrase "A Hagg like Hell" could also be interpreted as evoking a sense of uneasiness or discomfort, as it implies a dark and ominous atmosphere. Therefore, an alternative annotation could be:

Again , I see , the Heavenly Fair despis "d , (Annoyance)
A Hagg like Hell , with Gold , more highly priz "d ; (Uneasiness)
Mens Faith betray "d , their Prince and Country Sold , (Annoyance)
Their God deny "d , all for the Idol Gold . (Annoyance)

In this case, I have chosen to prioritize the label "Annoyance" as the dominant emotion, but also acknowledged the presence of "Uneasiness" in the second line.

Here's the annotated stanza:

Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar , (Annoyance)
What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ? (Annoyance)
If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray , (Annoyance)
Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ? (Annoyance)
Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find , (Annoyance)
Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind . (Annoyance)

I have chosen the label "Annoyance" for each line because the stanza evokes a sense of frustration and anger towards the person who led Israel astray and caused humanity to sin. The speaker seems to be lamenting the consequences of this action, which is why the dominant emotion is annoyance.

However, upon re-reading the stanza, I notice that the phrase "Some strange unheard-of Judgement" could also be interpreted as evoking a sense of uneasiness or discomfort, as it implies a sense of uncertainty and foreboding. Therefore, an alternative annotation could be:

Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar , (Annoyance)
What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ? (Annoyance)
If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray , (Annoyance)
Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ? (Annoyance)
Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find , (Uneasiness)
Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind . (Annoyance)

In this case, I have chosen to prioritize the label "Annoyance" as the dominant emotion, but also acknowledged the presence of "Uneasiness" in the fifth line.
