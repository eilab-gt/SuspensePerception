Here's the annotation of the given stanza:

HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, [Uneasiness]
Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year! [Uneasiness]
My hasting days fly on with full career, [Vitality]
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th. [Sadness]
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, [Annoyance]
That I to manhood am arrived so near, [Annoyance]
And inward ripeness doth much less appear, [Annoyance]
That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th. [Annoyance]
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, [Annoyance]
It shall be still in strictest measure even [Annoyance]
To that same lot, however mean or high, [Annoyance]
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven, [Annoyance]
All is, if I have grace to use it so, [Annoyance]
As ever in my great Task-master’s eye [Awe/Sublime]

Reasoning:

- The first line "HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth" creates a sense of uneasiness due to the mention of time stealing youth.
- The second line "Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year" further emphasizes this uneasiness.
- The third line "My hasting days fly on with full career" has a sense of vitality, as it talks about the passing of time.
- The fourth line "But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th" creates a sense of sadness, as it talks about the lack of growth.
- The following lines create a sense of annoyance, as they talk about the passing of time and the speaker's lack of growth, which is a source of frustration.
- The last line "As ever in my great Task-master’s eye" creates a sense of awe or the sublime, as it talks about a higher power watching over the speaker.
