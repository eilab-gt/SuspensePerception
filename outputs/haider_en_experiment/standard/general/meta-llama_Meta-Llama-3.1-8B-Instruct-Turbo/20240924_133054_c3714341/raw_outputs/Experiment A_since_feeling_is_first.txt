Based on the guidelines and the provided examples, I will annotate the given stanza:

since feeling is first [Vitality]
who pays any attention [Vitality]
to the syntax of things [Vitality]
will never wholly kiss you; [Sadness] [Annoyance]
wholly to be a fool [Sadness] [Annoyance]
while Spring is in the world [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning:

- The first three lines evoke a sense of vitality and energy, as they talk about the importance of feeling and the beauty of the world. This is consistent with the label "Vitality" (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me).
- The fourth line, "will never wholly kiss you," suggests a sense of sadness and annoyance, as it implies that the speaker is aware that they will never fully experience or connect with the subject of the poem. This is consistent with the label "Sadness" (makes me sad/touches me) and "Annoyance" (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated).
- The final line, "while Spring is in the world," has a positive connotation, evoking a sense of beauty and joy, which is consistent with the label "Beauty/Joy" (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful).
Based on the guidelines and the provided examples, I will annotate the given stanza:
