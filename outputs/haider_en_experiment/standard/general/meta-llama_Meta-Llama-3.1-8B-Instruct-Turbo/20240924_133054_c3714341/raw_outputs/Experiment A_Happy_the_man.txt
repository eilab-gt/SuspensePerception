Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

Happy the man, and happy he alone, [Vitality]
He who can call today his own: [Vitality]
He who, secure within, can say, [Vitality]
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today. [Vitality]
Be fair or foul or rain or shine [Vitality]
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine. [Vitality]
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power, [Vitality]
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour. [Vitality]

The entire stanza evokes a sense of confidence, security, and appreciation for the present moment, which is characteristic of the label "Vitality". The speaker seems to be saying that as long as one has lived in the present, they can face whatever the future holds. The tone is uplifting and encouraging, which aligns with the definition of "Vitality".
