Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

WHEN I consider how my light is spent
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide, [Sadness] [Annoyance]
And that one Talent which is death to hide [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent [Sadness] [Annoyance]

I chose the labels "Sadness" and "Annoyance" because the speaker is expressing feelings of sadness and frustration about their life being spent, their talent being useless, and their soul being bent. The use of words like "spent," "dark," and "useless" evokes a sense of sorrow and annoyance.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

To serve therewith my Maker, and present [Vitality]
My true account, lest He returning chide, [Vitality]
“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?” [Vitality]
I fondly ask. [Vitality]
But Patience, to prevent [Annoyance]

I chose the labels "Vitality" for the first four lines, as the speaker is expressing a sense of purpose and determination to serve their Maker and present their account. The use of words like "serve", "true account", and "fondly ask" convey a sense of energy and vitality.

For the last line, I chose the label "Annoyance", as the speaker is expressing a sense of frustration and impatience with the idea of waiting for God to return and potentially chide them. The use of the word "prevent" implies a sense of annoyance at the idea of having to wait.

Note that I did not choose the label "Suspense" for this stanza, as while the speaker is asking a question and expressing a sense of anticipation, the tone is more one of determination and purpose rather than suspense or curiosity.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need [Vitality]
Either man’s work or his own gifts. [Vitality]
Who best [Vitality]
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. [Vitality]
His state [Vitality]

I chose the label "Vitality" for all lines, as the speaker is discussing the idea that God does not need human work or gifts, and that those who accept and serve God's will are the ones who truly serve him. The use of words like "mild yoke" and "serve him best" convey a sense of energy and vitality.

Note that I did not choose any other labels, as the dominant emotion in this stanza is one of vitality and energy, and the tone is more one of encouragement and acceptance rather than any other emotion.

Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed, [Vitality]
And post o’er land and ocean without rest; [Vitality]
They also serve who only stand and wait. [Vitality]

I chose the label "Vitality" for all lines, as the speaker is discussing the idea that even those who are not actively serving God are still serving him by standing and waiting. The use of words like "kingly", "speed", and "post o'er" convey a sense of energy and movement, and the phrase "without rest" suggests a sense of dynamism and vitality.

Note that I did not choose any other labels, as the dominant emotion in this stanza is one of vitality and energy, and the tone is more one of encouragement and acceptance rather than any other emotion.
