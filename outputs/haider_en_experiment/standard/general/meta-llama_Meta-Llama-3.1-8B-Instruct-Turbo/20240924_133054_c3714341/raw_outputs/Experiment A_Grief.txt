I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless; [Sadness]
That only men incredulous of despair, [Sadness]
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air [Sadness]
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access [Annoyance]
Of shrieking and reproach. [Annoyance]
Full desertness, [Uneasiness]
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare [Uneasiness]
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare [Uneasiness]
Of the absolute heavens. [Uneasiness]
Deep-hearted man, express [Vitality]
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death— [Sadness]
Most like a monumental statue set [Sadness]
In everlasting watch and moveless woe [Sadness]
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath. [Sadness]
Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet: [Sadness]
If it could weep, it could arise and go. [Vitality]
