Based on the provided guidelines and examples, I will annotate the given stanza.

The first line "I wandered through each chartered street" might evoke a sense of Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful) because the word "chartered" can imply a sense of confinement or control, and the phrase "chartered street" might suggest a sense of artificiality or restriction.

The second line "Near where the chartered Thames does flow" might also evoke a sense of Uneasiness for the same reason, but it could also be annotated as Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness) if the reader finds the idea of the Thames, a major river in London, evoking a sense of grandeur or power.

The third line "A mark in every face I meet" might evoke a sense of Sadness (makes me sad/touches me) because it implies that the speaker is seeing signs of suffering or pain in the faces of others.

The fourth line "Marks of weakness, marks of woe" explicitly states that the speaker sees signs of suffering, which could be annotated as Sadness (makes me sad/touches me).

Considering the overall tone of the stanza, I would annotate it as follows:

I wandered through each chartered street [Uneasiness]
Near where the chartered Thames does flow [Awe/Sublime / Uneasiness]
A mark in every face I meet [Sadness]
Marks of weakness, marks of woe [Sadness]
