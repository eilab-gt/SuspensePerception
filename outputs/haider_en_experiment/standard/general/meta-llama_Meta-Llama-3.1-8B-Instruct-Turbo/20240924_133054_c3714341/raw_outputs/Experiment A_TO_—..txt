4. Love itself shall slumber on .
- Love itself shall slumber on (this line can be seen as a comforting and reassuring statement, which can be associated with a sense of beauty and joy, but also with a sense of sadness, as it implies that love will continue even after the beloved is gone. However, the dominant emotion in this case is not clear-cut, and it can be argued that the overall tone of the stanza is more melancholic and nostalgic than joyful. Therefore, I will annotate it as follows:
- Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) + Sadness (makes me sad/touches me) 
  (The phrase "Love itself shall slumber on" can be seen as a comforting and reassuring statement, but it also implies that love will continue even after the beloved is gone, which can be associated with a sense of nostalgia and sadness.)
