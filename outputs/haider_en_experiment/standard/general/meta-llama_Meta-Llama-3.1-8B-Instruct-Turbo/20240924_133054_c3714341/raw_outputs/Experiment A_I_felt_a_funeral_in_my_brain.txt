Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

I felt a funeral in my brain, [Sadness]
And mourners, to and fro, [Sadness]

That sense was breaking through. [Sadness]

And when they all were seated, [Sadness]
A service like a drum [Uneasiness]

My mind was going numb. [Sadness]

I chose the label "Sadness" for the first and third lines because the overall atmosphere of the stanza is melancholic and sorrowful, evoking feelings of sadness. The use of words like "numb" contributes to this somber mood.

For the second line, I chose the label "Uneasiness" because the phrase "A service like a drum" creates a sense of discomfort and unease, which is not quite sadness, but rather a feeling of being unsettled or disturbed.
