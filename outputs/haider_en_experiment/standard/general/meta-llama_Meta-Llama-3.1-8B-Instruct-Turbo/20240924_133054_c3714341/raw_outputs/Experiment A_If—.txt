Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, [Annoyance] [Sadness]
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, [Annoyance] [Sadness]
But make allowance for their doubting too; [Annoyance] [Sadness]
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, [Vitality]
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, [Vitality]
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, [Vitality]
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: [Vitality]

- In the first line, "Are losing theirs and blaming it on you," I feel a sense of annoyance and sadness because the speaker is implying that others are quick to blame, which can be frustrating and sad.
- In the second line, "If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you," I still feel a sense of annoyance and sadness because the speaker is talking about being doubted by others, which can be frustrating and sad.
- In the third line, "But make allowance for their doubting too," I still feel a sense of annoyance and sadness because the speaker is acknowledging that others may doubt, which can be frustrating and sad.
- In the fourth line, "If you can wait and not be tired by waiting," I feel a sense of vitality because the speaker is talking about perseverance and not giving up, which can be invigorating.
- In the fifth and sixth lines, "Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, Or being hated, don’t give way to hating," I feel a sense of vitality because the speaker is talking about standing up for oneself and not giving in to negativity, which can be invigorating.
- In the seventh line, "And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise," I feel a sense of vitality because the speaker is talking about humility and not letting pride get in the way, which can be invigorating.

Note that I used the dominant emotion for each line, which is a mix of annoyance/sadness and vitality.
