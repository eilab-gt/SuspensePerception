 This stanza evokes a strong sense of Uneasiness (frightening, disturbing) for me. The imagery of the all-composing hour resisting and then giving in to the power of Night primaeval and Chaos old, and the description of how various artistic, philosophical, and moral concepts fade away before the approach of Night, creates a feeling of impending doom and the loss of order and understanding. The idea of Religion and Morality expiring and the universal Darkness burying all is particularly unsettling. Therefore, the dominant emotion label for this stanza would be Uneasiness.

Additionally, there is a hint of Sadness (touching me) in the stanza as well, as the loss of various concepts and the restoration of Chaos evokes a sense of loss and melancholy. However, since the dominant emotion is Uneasiness, it should be the primary label used for this stanza.
