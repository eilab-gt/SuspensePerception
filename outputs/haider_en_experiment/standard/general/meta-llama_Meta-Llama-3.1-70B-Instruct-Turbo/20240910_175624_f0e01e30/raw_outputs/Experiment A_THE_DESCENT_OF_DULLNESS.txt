The dominant emotion in this stanza is Awe/Sublime, as it evokes a sense of grandeur and power. However, it is often accompanied by Uneasiness, as the subject matter is dark and chaotic. Sadness is also present in some lines, as the poem describes the decay and death of various aspects of human knowledge and understanding.
