O rose , thou art sick ! [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
The invisible worm , [Uneasiness]

- The first line, "O rose , thou art sick !" evokes feelings of sadness, as it describes the rose as being sick, which is an unfortunate and pitiful state. Additionally, the use of the word "sick" creates a sense of uneasiness, as it implies something is wrong or diseased.
- The second line, "The invisible worm ," creates a sense of uneasiness, as the idea of an invisible worm can be unsettling and disturbing.
- The third line, "That flies in the night ," continues to evoke feelings of uneasiness, as the image of something flying in the night can be eerie and frightening.
- The fourth line, "In the howling storm ," also creates a sense of uneasiness, as the image of a howling storm is intense and potentially frightening.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is uneasiness, with a secondary emotion of sadness in the first line.
