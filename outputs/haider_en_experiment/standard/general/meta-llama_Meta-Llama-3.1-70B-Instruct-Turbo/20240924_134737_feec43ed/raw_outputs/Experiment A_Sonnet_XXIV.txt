To annotate the given stanza, I will follow the guidelines and instructions provided. Here's my annotation:

Let the world "s sharpness , like a clasping knife , [Beauty/Joy] [Uneasiness]
Shut in upon itself and do no harm [Beauty/Joy]
In this close hand of Love , now soft and warm , [Beauty/Joy]
And let us hear no sound of human strife [Beauty/Joy]
After the click of the shutting . Life to life â€” [Beauty/Joy]
I lean upon thee , Dear , without alarm , [Beauty/Joy]
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm [Beauty/Joy]
Against the stab of worldlings , who if rife [Uneasiness]
Are weak to injure . Very-whitely still [Beauty/Joy]
The lilies of our lives may reassure [Beauty/Joy]
Their blossoms from their roots , accessible [Beauty/Joy]
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer [Beauty/Joy]
Growing straight , out of man "s reach , on the hill . [Beauty/Joy]
God only , who made us rich , can make us poor . [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning for the chosen labels:

- The overall tone of the poem is peaceful and calming, which is why I've chosen the label "Beauty/Joy" for most of the lines. The speaker seems to be describing a safe and loving environment, which evokes feelings of joy and beauty.
- However, there are a few lines that mention the "sharpness" of the world and the potential for harm, which is why I've added the label "Uneasiness" to those lines. This label captures the feeling of discomfort or unease that these lines evoke.
- The last line of the poem takes a slightly different tone, mentioning the possibility of loss and poverty. This is why I've chosen the label "Sadness" for this line, as it evokes a sense of melancholy and concern.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this poem is one of beauty and joy, but with a few moments of unease and a hint of sadness at the end.
