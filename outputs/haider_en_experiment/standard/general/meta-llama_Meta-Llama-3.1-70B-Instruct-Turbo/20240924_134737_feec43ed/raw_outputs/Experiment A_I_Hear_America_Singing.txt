The dominant emotion in this stanza is Beauty/Joy, as it evokes a sense of happiness and pleasure from the description of various people singing and going about their daily lives. The label Vitality is also used in some lines to convey the sense of energy and movement, but Beauty/Joy is the primary emotion throughout the stanza.
