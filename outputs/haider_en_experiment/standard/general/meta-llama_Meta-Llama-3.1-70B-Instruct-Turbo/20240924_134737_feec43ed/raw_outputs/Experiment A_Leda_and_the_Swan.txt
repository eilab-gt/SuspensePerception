Based on the provided guidelines, I would annotate the given stanza as follows:

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. [Uneasiness] [Suspense]

The dominant emotion I feel in this stanza is Uneasiness, as the scene described is unsettling, with a sense of danger and predation. The image of the bird's dark webs and the girl's helpless state creates a feeling of discomfort and tension.

The secondary emotion I feel is Suspense, as the sudden blow and the bird's actions create a sense of drama and anticipation, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.

Note that I have chosen two labels per line, as the emotions are closely intertwined and both are present in each line. However, if I had to choose only one label per line, I would choose Uneasiness as the dominant emotion.
