Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

If you can keep your head when all about you [Vitality]
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, [Vitality]
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, [Vitality]
But make allowance for their doubting too; [Vitality]
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, [Vitality]
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, [Vitality]
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, [Vitality]
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: [Vitality]

The dominant emotion in this stanza is Vitality. The poem conveys a sense of resilience, determination, and self-confidence, which are all characteristics of the Vitality label. The speaker is encouraging the reader to stay strong and true to themselves, even in the face of adversity, which is an inspiring and invigorating message.

There are no other emotions that seem to dominate this stanza, so I have only used the Vitality label for each line.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; [Vitality]
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; [Vitality]
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster [Vitality]
And treat those two impostors just the same; [Vitality]
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken [Vitality] [Uneasiness]
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, [Vitality] [Uneasiness]
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, [Vitality] [Sadness]
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: [Vitality] [Sadness]

The dominant emotion in this stanza is Vitality. The poem conveys a sense of resilience, determination, and self-confidence, which are all characteristics of the Vitality label. The speaker is encouraging the reader to stay strong and focused, even in the face of adversity.

In lines 7 and 8, I have added the Sadness label, as the speaker is describing a situation where something precious has been broken, and the speaker must rebuild it with worn-out tools, which can evoke feelings of sadness and loss.

Overall, the dominant emotion of Vitality is balanced by these secondary emotions, which add depth and complexity to the poem.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings [Vitality]
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, [Vitality]
And lose, and start again at your beginnings [Vitality] [Sadness]
And never breathe a word about your loss; [Vitality] [Sadness]
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew [Vitality]
To serve your turn long after they are gone, [Vitality]
And so hold on when there is nothing in you [Vitality]
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ [Vitality]

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, [Vitality]
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, [Vitality]
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, [Vitality]
If all men count with you, but none too much; [Vitality]
If you can fill the unforgiving minute [Vitality]
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, [Vitality]

The phrase "Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it" is particularly grand and majestic, suggesting a sense of wonder and reverence.
