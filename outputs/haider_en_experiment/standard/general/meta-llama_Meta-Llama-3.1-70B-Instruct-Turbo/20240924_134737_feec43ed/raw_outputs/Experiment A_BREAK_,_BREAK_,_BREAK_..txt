The stanza is:
Break , break , break ,

For the second line, "On thy cold gray stones , O Sea !", the emotion is still one of sadness, but there's also a sense of awe or respect for the sea, so the labels would be:
• Sadness (makes me sad/touches me) and possibly • Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)

For the third line, "And I would that my tongue could utter", the emotion is one of longing or frustration, so the label would be:
• Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
