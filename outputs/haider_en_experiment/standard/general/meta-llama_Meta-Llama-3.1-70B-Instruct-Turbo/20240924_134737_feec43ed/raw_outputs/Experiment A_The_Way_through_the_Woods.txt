Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza. Here's my annotation:

They shut the road through the woods [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Seventy years ago. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Weather and rain have undone it again, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
And now you would never know [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
There was once a road through the woods [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Before they planted the trees. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
It is underneath the coppice and heath, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
And the thin anemones. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Only the keeper sees [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
That, where the ring-dove broods, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
And the badgers roll at ease, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
There was once a road through the woods. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The poem has a nostalgic tone, as it talks about a road that was shut down 70 years ago and is now hidden beneath the natural scenery. This nostalgia is accompanied by a sense of sadness, as the speaker seems to be reminiscing about something that is lost.
* The use of words like "shut", "undone", and "never know" creates a sense of loss and longing, which supports the annotation of nostalgia and sadness.
* The poem's focus on the passage of time and the natural world reclaiming the road also adds to the nostalgic and melancholic atmosphere.

Note that I have used the same annotation for each line, as the dominant emotions of nostalgia and sadness are consistent throughout the poem.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza. Here's my annotation:

Yet, if you enter the woods [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
Of a summer evening late, [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
Where the otter whistles his mate, [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
(They fear not men in the woods, [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
Because they see so few.) [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
You will hear the beat of a horseâ€™s feet, [Nostalgia] [Suspense]
And the swish of a skirt in the dew, [Nostalgia] [Suspense]
Steadily cantering through [Nostalgia] [Suspense]
The misty solitudes, [Nostalgia] [Suspense]
As though they perfectly knew [Nostalgia] [Suspense]
The old lost road through the woods. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
But there is no road through the woods. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The poem has a nostalgic tone, as it talks about a summer evening in the woods, evoking a sense of a past time or a lost era. This nostalgia is accompanied by a sense of beauty and joy, as the speaker describes the natural scenery and the sounds of the woods.
* The use of words like "summer evening late", "night-air cools", "trout-ringed pools", and "otter whistles his mate" creates a sense of serenity and peacefulness, which supports the annotation of beauty and joy.
* The introduction of the horse's feet and the swish of a skirt in the dew adds a sense of suspense, as the speaker is hinting at the presence of something or someone in the woods.
* The final two lines, "As though they perfectly knew / The old lost road through the woods. / But there is no road through the woods." create a sense of sadness, as the speaker reveals that the road is lost, and the nostalgia is tinged with a sense of loss.
