Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

John Anderson, my jo, John, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
When we were first acquent; [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Your locks were like the raven, [Beauty/Joy]
Your bonie brow was brent; [Beauty/Joy]
But now your brow is beld, John, [Sadness]
Your locks are like the snaw; [Sadness]
But blessings on your frosty pow, [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
John Anderson, my jo. [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

1. "John Anderson, my jo, John" - The speaker is reminiscing about the past and addressing someone they care about, which evokes a sense of nostalgia. The overall tone is also somewhat melancholic, which is why I've added sadness as a secondary emotion.

2. "When we were first acquent;" - This line reinforces the nostalgic feeling, and the speaker is looking back at a past time. The sadness is still present, as the speaker is acknowledging the passing of time.

3. "Your locks were like the raven," - The comparison to a raven is a poetic and beautiful image, which is why I've chosen Beauty/Joy for this line.

4. "Your bonie brow was brent;" - Similar to the previous line, the description of the brow is a positive and beautiful image, which is why I've chosen Beauty/Joy.

5. "But now your brow is beld, John," - The contrast between the past and present is stark, and the speaker is acknowledging the effects of time on John's appearance. This line is sad, as it highlights the passing of time and the loss of youth.

6. "Your locks are like the snaw;" - This line reinforces the sadness, as the speaker is describing John's hair as being like snow, which is a symbol of aging.

7. "But blessings on your frosty pow," - Despite the acknowledgment of aging, the speaker is offering a blessing, which is a positive sentiment. This line also has a nostalgic tone, as the speaker is looking back on their relationship.

8. "John Anderson, my jo." - The final line is a repetition of the first line, and it reinforces the nostalgic and melancholic tone. The speaker is expressing their affection for John, which is why I've chosen Beauty/Joy as a secondary emotion.
