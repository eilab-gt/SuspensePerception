To annotate the given stanza, we will follow the guidelines provided and label each line with the corresponding emotions. Here's the annotated stanza:

1. AT ten A.M. the young housewife
   - No dominant emotion, but it sets the scene. (No label)

2. moves about in negligee behind
   - The image is somewhat intimate, but not necessarily evocative of strong emotions. (No label)

3. the wooden walls of her husband"s house.
   - The line creates a sense of confinement or restriction. (Uneasiness)

4. I pass solitary in my car.
   - The line creates a sense of isolation. (Sadness)

5. Then again she comes to the curb
   - No dominant emotion, it's a continuation of the scene. (No label)

6. to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
   - The line is neutral, but the image of her standing might evoke a sense of vulnerability. (Uneasiness)

7. shy, uncorseted, tucking in
   - The image is somewhat intimate and vulnerable. (Uneasiness)

8. stray ends of hair, and I compare her
   - The line is neutral, but the comparison is coming. (No label)

9. to a fallen leaf.
   - The comparison is somewhat melancholic and evocative of decline or loss. (Sadness)

10. The noiseless wheels of my car
    - The line is neutral, setting the scene for the next action. (No label)

11. rush with a crackling sound over
    - The line creates a sense of movement and possibly unease. (Uneasiness)

12. dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling.
    - The action of bowing and passing smiling might be seen as a polite but somewhat insincere gesture, creating a sense of unease. (Uneasiness)

However, considering the entire stanza, the dominant emotion seems to be a mix of sadness and uneasiness. The speaker is isolated, and the young housewife is portrayed in a somewhat vulnerable and melancholic light. The comparison to a fallen leaf and the speaker's polite but possibly insincere gesture add to the sense of unease.
