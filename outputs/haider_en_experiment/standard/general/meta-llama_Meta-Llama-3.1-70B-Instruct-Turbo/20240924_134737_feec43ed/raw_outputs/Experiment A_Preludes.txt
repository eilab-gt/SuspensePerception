Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

The winter evening settles down [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
With smell of steaks in passageways . [Sadness]
Six o"clock . [Sadness]
The burnt-out ends of smoky days . [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
And now a gusty shower wraps [Uneasiness]
The grimy scraps [Uneasiness]
Of withered leaves about your feet [Sadness]
And newspapers from vacant lots ; [Sadness]
The showers beat [Uneasiness]
On broken blinds and chimney-pots , [Uneasiness]
And at the corner of the street [Sadness]
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps . [Sadness]
And then the lighting of the lamps . [Sadness]
