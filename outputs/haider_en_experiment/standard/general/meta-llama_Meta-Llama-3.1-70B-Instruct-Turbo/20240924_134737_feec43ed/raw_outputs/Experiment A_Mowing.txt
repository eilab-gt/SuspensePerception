Based on the guidelines and examples provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

THERE was never a sound beside the wood but one , [Beauty/Joy]
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground . [Beauty/Joy]
What was it it whispered ? I knew not well myself ; [Suspense]
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun , [Beauty/Joy]
Something , perhaps , about the lack of sound â€” [Suspense]
And that was why it whispered and did not speak . [Suspense]
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours , [Sadness]
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf : [Sadness]
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak [Sadness]
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows , [Beauty/Joy]
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers [Beauty/Joy]
( Pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake . [Uneasiness]
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows . [Beauty/Joy]
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make . [Beauty/Joy]

Here's a breakdown of my annotation:

* Lines 1-2: The peaceful atmosphere and the whispering scythe evoke a sense of beauty and joy.
* Line 3: The uncertainty of what the scythe whispered creates suspense.
* Line 4: The mention of the heat of the sun brings back the beauty and joy.
* Lines 5-6: The suspense continues as the speaker is unsure why the scythe whispered.
* Lines 7-9: The speaker's rejection of idle hours and easy gold creates a sense of sadness, possibly due to the speaker's hard work and dedication.
* Lines 10-11: The earnest love and the beautiful flowers evoke a sense of beauty and joy.
* Line 12: The sudden appearance of a bright green snake creates uneasiness.
* Line 13: The appreciation of the fact and the sweetness of labor brings back the beauty and joy.
* Line 14: The final line reinforces the beauty and joy of the scene.

Note that I have used a mix of emotions to annotate the stanza, trying to capture the nuances of the speaker's feelings and the atmosphere of the poem.
