To annotate the given stanza, I will follow the guidelines and instructions provided.

1. I will read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
2. I will choose at least one label per line and use as few emotions as possible.
3. I will choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza and add another emotion if necessary.

Here's the annotated stanza:

I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless; [Sadness]
That only men incredulous of despair, [Sadness]
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access [Annoyance]
Of shrieking and reproach. [Annoyance]
Full desertness, [Sadness]
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare [Sadness]
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare [Uneasiness]
Of the absolute heavens. [Awe/Sublime]
Deep-hearted man, express [Sadness]
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death— [Sadness]
Most like a monumental statue set [Sadness]
In everlasting watch and moveless woe [Sadness]
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath. [Sadness]
Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet: [Sadness]
If it could weep, it could arise and go. [Sadness]

In this stanza, the dominant emotion is sadness, which is present throughout the poem. The speaker describes hopeless grief, despair, and the silence of death. The use of words like "desertness," "silent-bare," and "moveless woe" reinforces the feeling of sadness.

The annotation also includes annoyance, which is present in lines 3-5, where the speaker describes the "shrieking and reproach" and the "men incredulous of despair." This emotion is secondary to sadness but adds to the overall tone of the poem.

The use of "Awe/Sublime" in line 9 is due to the reference to "the absolute heavens," which evokes a sense of grandeur and power.

The "Uneasiness" in line 8 is due to the "blanching, vertical eye-glare," which creates an unsettling image.

Overall, the annotation reflects the dominant emotion of sadness, with secondary emotions of annoyance, awe/sublime, and uneasiness adding depth and complexity to the poem.
