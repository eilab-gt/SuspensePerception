- The sixth line returns to a sense of sadness, as the speaker is alone in their room.
- The seventh to tenth lines have a humorous tone, as the speaker is dancing naked and singing to themselves.
- The eleventh to thirteenth lines express sadness, as the speaker feels lonely and believes they were born to be that way.

To annotate the given stanza, we need to follow the guidelines provided. Here's the annotation:

who shall say I am not [Humor]
the happy genius of my household ? [Humor]

Explanation:
- The lines have a humorous tone, as the speaker is making a statement that seems ironic or tongue-in-cheek, given the context of the previous stanza which described a scene of loneliness and isolation. The speaker's claim to be the "happy genius of my household" may be seen as a joke or a form of self-deprecation.

However, an alternative annotation could be:

who shall say I am not [Vitality]
the happy genius of my household ? [Vitality]

Explanation:
- The lines could also be seen as having a sense of vitality, as the speaker is making a statement that conveys confidence and self-assurance. The use of the phrase "happy genius" suggests a sense of energy and positivity.
