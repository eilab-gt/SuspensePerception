Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

When my love swears that she is made of truth , [Beauty/Joy] [Humor]
I do believe her , though I know she lies , [Humor] [Beauty/Joy]
That she might think me some untutor "d youth , [Humor]
Unskilful in the world "s false forgeries , [Humor]
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young , [Humor] [Beauty/Joy]
Although I know my years be past the best , [Sadness] [Humor]
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue , [Beauty/Joy] [Humor]
Outfacing faults in love with love "s ill rest . [Beauty/Joy]
But wherefore says my love that she is young ? [Humor]
And wherefore say not I that I am old ? [Humor]
O , love "s best habit is a soothing tongue , [Beauty/Joy]
And age , in love , loves not to have years told . [Beauty/Joy]
Therefore , I "ll lie with love , and love with me , [Beauty/Joy]
Since that our faults in love thus smother "d be . [Beauty/Joy]

The dominant emotion in this stanza is Humor, as the speaker is playfully acknowledging the lies and flaws in their relationship, and the use of irony and wordplay creates a lighthearted tone. However, Beauty/Joy is also present throughout the stanza, as the speaker is expressing their love and affection for their partner, and the overall tone is romantic and optimistic. There is a brief moment of Sadness in the line "Although I know my years be past the best", but it is quickly overshadowed by the dominant Humor and Beauty/Joy.
