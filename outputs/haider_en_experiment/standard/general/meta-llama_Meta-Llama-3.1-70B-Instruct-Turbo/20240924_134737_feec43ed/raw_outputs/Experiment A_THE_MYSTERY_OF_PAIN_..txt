Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the given stanza as follows:

Pain has an element of blank ; [Sadness]
It cannot recollect [Sadness]
When it began , or if there were [Sadness]
A day when it was not . [Sadness]

The reason for choosing the label "Sadness" for each line is that the poem describes pain in a way that evokes feelings of sorrow and melancholy. The use of words like "blank" and "cannot recollect" creates a sense of emptiness and hopelessness, which contributes to the overall feeling of sadness. The poem's focus on the persistence and timelessness of pain also adds to the somber and sorrowful tone, making "Sadness" the most fitting label for this stanza.

Alternatively, one could also consider using the label "Uneasiness" in addition to "Sadness", as the poem's description of pain can also be seen as unsettling and disturbing. However, based on the guidelines, it is recommended to use as few emotions as possible, and "Sadness" seems to be the most dominant emotion in this stanza.
