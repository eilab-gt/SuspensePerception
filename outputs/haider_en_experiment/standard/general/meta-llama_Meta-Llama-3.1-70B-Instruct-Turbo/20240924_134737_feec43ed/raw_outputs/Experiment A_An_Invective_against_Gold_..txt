Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Of all the Poisons that the fruitful Earth [Annoyance] [Sadness]
E"er yet brought forth , or Monsters she gave Birth , [Annoyance] [Sadness]
Nought to Mankind has e"er so fatal been , [Annoyance] [Sadness]
As thou , accursed Gold , their Care and Sin . [Annoyance] [Sadness]

My reasoning for the chosen labels is as follows:

* Annoyance: The tone of the stanza seems to be critical and disapproving of the effects of gold on humanity, which suggests a sense of frustration or annoyance.
* Sadness: The language used in the stanza, such as "fatal", "accursed", and "Sin", creates a somber and melancholic atmosphere, which suggests a sense of sadness.

I chose these two labels because they seem to be the most dominant emotions conveyed in the stanza. The use of strong words like "Poisons", "Monsters", and "accursed" creates a sense of discomfort and unease, but the overall tone is more critical and disapproving, which is why I chose Annoyance as the primary label. The sadness label is added to convey the sense of loss and suffering that is implied in the stanza.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Methinks I the Advent"rous Merchant see , [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Ploughing the faithless Seas , in search of thee , [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
His dearest Wife and Children left behind , [Sadness]
( His real Wealth ) while he , a Slave to th ’ Wind , [Sadness]
Sometimes becalm "d , the Shore with longing Eyes [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Wishes to see , and what he wishes , Spies : [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
For a rude Tempest wakes him from his Dream , [Uneasiness]
And Strands his Bark by a more sad Extream . [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Thus , hopless Wretch , is his whole Life-time spent , [Sadness]
And though thrice Wreck"t , ‘ s no Wiser than he went . [Sadness] [Annoyance]

My reasoning for the chosen labels is as follows:

* Sadness: The overall tone of the stanza is melancholic and somber, with a focus on the merchant's struggles and losses. The use of words like "left behind", "Slave", "longing", and "hopeless" creates a sense of sadness.
* Uneasiness: The stanza also conveys a sense of unease and discomfort, particularly in the descriptions of the "faithless Seas", "rude Tempest", and the merchant's ship being stranded. This creates a sense of tension and uncertainty.
* Nostalgia: The lines "Sometimes becalm'd, the Shore with longing Eyes / Wishes to see, and what he wishes, Spies" suggest a sense of nostalgia, as the merchant is longing for something or someone he has left behind. This is a sentimental longing for something in the past, which is a key characteristic of nostalgia.
* Annoyance: The final line "And though thrice Wreck't, 's no Wiser than he went" suggests a sense of frustration or annoyance, as the merchant's experiences have not led to any growth or wisdom.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Again , I see , the Heavenly Fair despis "d , [Sadness] [Annoyance]
A Hagg like Hell , with Gold , more highly priz "d ; [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Mens Faith betray "d , their Prince and Country Sold , [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Their God deny "d , all for the Idol Gold . [Sadness] [Annoyance]

My reasoning for the chosen labels is as follows:

* Sadness: The overall tone of the stanza is melancholic and somber, with a focus on the negative consequences of prioritizing gold over higher values. The use of words like "despis'd", "betray'd", and "deny'd" creates a sense of sadness and loss.
* Annoyance: The stanza also conveys a sense of frustration and annoyance, as the speaker is critical of the way people prioritize gold over their faith, prince, and country. The use of words like "Hagg like Hell" and "Idol Gold" creates a sense of disgust and annoyance.

I chose these two labels because they seem to be the most dominant emotions conveyed in the stanza. The speaker's tone is critical and disapproving, which suggests a sense of annoyance, but the overall tone is also melancholic and somber, which suggests a sense of sadness.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar , [Sadness] [Annoyance]
What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ? [Sadness] [Annoyance]
If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray , [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ? [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find , [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind . [Sadness] [Annoyance]

My reasoning for the chosen labels is as follows:

* Sadness: The overall tone of the stanza is melancholic and somber, with a focus on the negative consequences of the wretch's actions. The use of words like "Unhappy", "Vengeance", "severe Reward", and "Sin" creates a sense of sadness and loss.
* Annoyance: The stanza also conveys a sense of frustration and annoyance, as the speaker is critical of the wretch's actions and their consequences. The use of words like "Wretch" and "Vengeance" creates a sense of disapproval and annoyance.
* Uneasiness: The line "Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find" creates a sense of unease and uncertainty, as the speaker is suggesting that the wretch will face an unknown and potentially frightening punishment.

I chose these labels because they seem to be the most dominant emotions conveyed in the stanza. The speaker's tone is critical and disapproving, which suggests a sense of annoyance, but the overall tone is also melancholic and somber, which suggests a sense of sadness. The use of words like "Vengeance" and "Judgement" creates a sense of unease and uncertainty, which is why I chose uneasiness as a secondary label for the fifth line.
