since feeling is first [Beauty/Joy]
who pays any attention [Beauty/Joy]
to the syntax of things [Beauty/Joy]

wholly to be a fool [Beauty/Joy]
while Spring is in the world [Vitality] [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning:

* The poem has a romantic and carefree tone, which suggests a sense of beauty and joy. The speaker is emphasizing the importance of feeling and experience over rational thinking.
* The use of the phrase "wholly to be a fool" could be seen as a playful and lighthearted way of embracing the beauty of the world, rather than a negative commentary on foolishness.
* The final line, "while Spring is in the world", adds a sense of vitality and energy to the poem, as it evokes the idea of new life and growth. This is why I've added the label "Vitality" to this line, in addition to "Beauty/Joy".

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is one of beauty and joy, with a sense of vitality and energy in the final line.
