Based on the provided guidelines and examples, I will annotate the given stanza with the corresponding labels:

My spirit is too weak—mortality [Sadness]
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, [Sadness]
And each imagined pinnacle and steep [Sadness] [Awe/Sublime]
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die [Sadness] [Awe/Sublime]
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky. [Sadness] [Awe/Sublime]
Yet ‘tis a gentle luxury to weep, [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep, [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye. [Sadness] [Awe/Sublime]
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain [Awe/Sublime]
Bring round the heart an indescribable feud; [Sadness] [Awe/Sublime]
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, [Sadness] [Awe/Sublime]
That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude [Awe/Sublime]
Wasting of old Time—with a billowy main— [Awe/Sublime]
A sun—a shadow of a magnitude. [Awe/Sublime]
