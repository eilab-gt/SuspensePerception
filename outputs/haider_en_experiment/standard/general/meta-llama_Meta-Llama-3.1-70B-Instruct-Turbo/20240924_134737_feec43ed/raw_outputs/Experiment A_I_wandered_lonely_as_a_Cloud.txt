Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

I wandered lonely as a Cloud [Sadness]
That floats on high over Vales and Hills , [Beauty/Joy]
When all at once I saw a crowd [Suspense]
A host of dancing Daffodills ; [Beauty/Joy]
Along the Lake , beneath the trees , [Beauty/Joy]
Ten thousand dancing in the breeze . [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning is as follows:

- The first line "I wandered lonely as a Cloud" evokes a sense of sadness and isolation, so I chose the label "Sadness".
- The second line "That floats on high over Vales and Hills" creates a sense of beauty and freedom, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy".
- The third line "When all at once I saw a crowd" creates a sense of surprise and interest, so I chose the label "Suspense".
- The remaining lines "A host of dancing Daffodills ; Along the Lake , beneath the trees , Ten thousand dancing in the breeze" evoke a sense of beauty and joy, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" for each of these lines.

Note that I have chosen to use only one label per line, as per the guidelines, and have tried to select the label that best captures the dominant emotion evoked by each line.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Continuous as the stars that shine [Beauty/Joy]
And twinkle on the milky way, [Beauty/Joy]
They stretched in never-ending line [Beauty/Joy]
Along the margin of a bay: [Beauty/Joy]
Ten thousand saw I at a glance, [Beauty/Joy]
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning is as follows:

- The entire stanza creates a sense of beauty and wonder, with the comparison of the stars to the scene described, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" for each line.
- The use of words like "shine", "twinkle", "sprightly dance" and "glance" creates a sense of movement and energy, but it is not strong enough to justify the use of the "Vitality" label.
- The overall tone of the stanza is peaceful and serene, with no hint of sadness, uneasiness, or suspense, so I did not choose any of those labels.
- The scene described is not nostalgic, so I did not choose the "Nostalgia" label.
- The stanza does not have any elements of humor, annoyance, or awe/sublime, so I did not choose those labels either.

Note that I have chosen to use only one label per line, as per the guidelines, and have tried to select the label that best captures the dominant emotion evoked by each line.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

The waves beside them danced , but they [Beauty/Joy]
Outdid the sparkling waves in glee :— [Beauty/Joy]
A Poet could not but be gay [Beauty/Joy]
In such a laughing company : [Beauty/Joy]
I gazed — and gazed — but little thought [Beauty/Joy]
What wealth the shew to me had brought : [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning is as follows:

- The entire stanza creates a sense of joy and happiness, with the description of the waves and the company being "gay" and "laughing", so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" for each line.
- The use of words like "danced", "glee", "gay", and "laughing" creates a sense of movement and energy, but it is not strong enough to justify the use of the "Vitality" label.
- The overall tone of the stanza is peaceful and serene, with no hint of sadness, uneasiness, or suspense, so I did not choose any of those labels.
- The scene described is not nostalgic, so I did not choose the "Nostalgia" label.
- The stanza does not have any elements of humor, annoyance, or awe/sublime, so I did not choose those labels either.

Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

For oft when on my couch I lie [Sadness]
In vacant or in pensive mood , [Sadness]
They flash upon that inward eye [Beauty/Joy]
Which is the bliss of solitude , [Beauty/Joy]
And then my heart with pleasure fills , [Beauty/Joy]
And dances with the Daffodils . [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning is as follows:

- The first two lines "For oft when on my couch I lie / In vacant or in pensive mood" create a sense of sadness and introspection, so I chose the label "Sadness" for these lines.
- The remaining lines "They flash upon that inward eye / Which is the bliss of solitude , / And then my heart with pleasure fills , / And dances with the Daffodils" evoke a sense of beauty and joy, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" for these lines.
- The use of words like "pleasure", "bliss", and "dances" creates a sense of happiness and movement, which is consistent with the "Beauty/Joy" label.
- The overall tone of the stanza is contemplative and introspective, but ultimately joyful and uplifting, so I did not choose any of the other labels.

Note that I have chosen to use only one label per line, as per the guidelines, and have tried to select the label that best captures the dominant emotion evoked by each line.
