Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

I wandered through each chartered street , [Sadness]
Near where the chartered Thames does flow , [Sadness]
A mark in every face I meet , [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Marks of weakness , marks of woe . [Sadness]

My reasoning for the annotations is as follows:

* The overall tone of the stanza is melancholic and somber, which suggests a dominant emotion of Sadness.
* The use of words like "marks of weakness" and "marks of woe" reinforces this interpretation, as they evoke feelings of sorrow and distress.
* The phrase "A mark in every face I meet" suggests a sense of observation and awareness of the suffering of others, which could also contribute to feelings of Annoyance or frustration, hence the additional annotation of Annoyance on the third line.

Note that I have chosen to annotate each line with the dominant emotion of Sadness, as it is the most prominent emotion throughout the stanza. The additional annotation of Annoyance on the third line is used to capture the subtle nuance of frustration or discomfort that arises from observing the suffering of others.
