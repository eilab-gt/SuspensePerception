To annotate the given stanza, I will follow the guidelines and instructions provided. Here is the annotation:

I met a traveller from an antique land [Suspense]
Who said : Two vast and trunkless legs of stone [Suspense]
Stand in the desert ... Near them , on the sand , [Suspense]
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown , [Uneasiness]
And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , [Uneasiness]
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read [Awe/Sublime]
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things , [Awe/Sublime]
The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed : [Awe/Sublime]
And on the pedestal these words appear : [Awe/Sublime]
‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings : [Awe/Sublime]
Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! ’ [Awe/Sublime]
Nothing beside remains . [Sadness]
Round the decay [Sadness]
Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare [Uneasiness]
The lone and level sands stretch far away . [Sadness]

Here's a breakdown of my annotation:

* The first three lines are annotated with Suspense as they create a sense of curiosity and anticipation about the story the traveller is going to tell.
* The description of the shattered visage and its expression evoke a sense of Uneasiness, as it creates an image of something unsettling and disturbing.
* The lines that describe the sculptor's skill and the passions that survive on the lifeless things are annotated with Awe/Sublime, as they convey a sense of greatness and wonder.
* The inscription on the pedestal, which boasts of Ozymandias' greatness, is also annotated with Awe/Sublime, as it reinforces the sense of grandeur and power.
* The last three lines, however, take a different turn, and are annotated with Sadness, as they describe the decay and emptiness of the once-great monument, and the vast, bare sands that stretch far away, creating a sense of desolation and melancholy. The line "Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare" is also annotated with Uneasiness, as it emphasizes the sense of decay and desolation.
