Uneasiness (found it unsettling/disturbing) [Uneasiness]
Sadness (touches me) [Sadness]
Responsibility (not a label, but notable)
Colonialism's weight is felt in these lines, provoking uneasiness due to its portrayal of imperialism and the complex dynamics of power. The phrase "Half devil and half child" adds to the uneasiness, depicting the patronizing view of colonized peoples. Simultaneously, a sense of sadness can be inferred for the loss of freedom and the imposed burdens, both on those sent to rule and those being ruled. However, "Responsibility" is not a designated label, so it's not used in annotation.
