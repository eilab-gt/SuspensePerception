In vain, in vain — the all-composing Hour [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Resistless falls : the Muse obeys the Pow'r. [Uneasiness]
She comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold [Awe / Sublime] [Uneasiness]
Of Night primæval and of Chaos old ! [Awe / Sublime] [Uneasiness]
Before her, Fancy's gilded clouds decay, [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
And all its varying Rain-bows die away. [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires, [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
The meteor drops, and in a flash expires. [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
As one by one, at dread Medea's strain, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
The sick'ning stars fade off the ethereal plain; [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
As Argus’ eyes by Hermes’ wand opprest, [Uneasiness] [Sadness]
Closed one by one to everlasting rest; [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Thus at her felt approach, and secret might, [Uneasiness] [Sadness]
Art after Art goes out, and all is Night. [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled, [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head! [Uneasiness]
Philosophy, that lean'd on Heav'n before, [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more. [Sadness]
Physic of Metaphysic begs defence, [Uneasiness]
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense! [Uneasiness]
See Mystery to Mathematics fly! [Uneasiness]
In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die. [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Religion blushing veils her sacred fires, [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
And unawares Morality expires. [Sadness]
For public Flame, nor private, dares to shine; [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Nor human Spark is left, nor Glimpse divine! [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Lo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restor'd; [Awe / Sublime] [Uneasiness]
Light dies before thy uncreating word; [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall, [Uneasiness]
And universal Darkness buries All. [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
