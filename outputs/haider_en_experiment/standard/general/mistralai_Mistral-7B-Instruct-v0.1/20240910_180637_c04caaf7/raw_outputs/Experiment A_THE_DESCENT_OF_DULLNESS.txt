 The following is an annotation of the stanza:

In vain, in vain — the all-composing Hour
Resistless falls : the Muse obeys the Pow"r .

Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)

She comes ! she comes ! the sable Throne behold
Of Night primæval and of Chaos old !

Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)

Before her , Fancy "s gilded clouds decay ,
And all its varying Rain-bows die away .

Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)

Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires ,
The meteor drops , and in a flash expires .

Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

As one by one , at dread Medea "s strain,
The sick"ning stars fade off th ’ ethereal plain ;
As Argus ’ eyes by Hermes ’ wand opprest,
Clos "d one by one to everlasting rest ;
Thus at her felt approach , and secret might,
Art after Art goes out , and all is Night .

Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)

See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,
Mountains of Casuistry heap "d o"er her head !
Philosophy , that lean "d on Heav"n before ,
Shrinks to her second cause , and is no more .
Physic of Metaphysic begs defence,
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense !
See Mystery to Mathematics fly !
In vain ! they gaze , turn giddy , rave, and die .

Religion blushing veils her sacred fires,
And unawares Morality expires.
For public Flame , nor private, dares to shine ;
Nor human Spark is left, nor Glimpse divine !

Lo ! thy dread Empire , CHAOS ! is restor "d ;
Light dies before thy uncreating word ;
Thy hand , great Anarch ! lets the curtain fall,
And universal Darkness buries All.
