This is a guidelines document for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels for annotating emotions, along with instructions for annotators on how to use these labels. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) (must be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotators include:

* Annotate each line of the poem, not each sentence.
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line, but no more than two.
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza, and add another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia must always be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

The document also provides examples of annotated poems to serve as a gold standard for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to different lines of poetry.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Take up the White Man"s burden - [Uneasiness]
The savage wars of peace - [Uneasiness]
Fill full the mouth of famine [Uneasiness]
And bid the sickness cease; [Uneasiness]
And when your goal is nearest [Suspense]
The end for others sought, [Suspense]
Watch Sloth and heathen Folly [Uneasiness]
Bring all your hopes to nought. [Uneasiness]

My annotation is based on the following reasoning:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of uneasiness, as they describe the "White Man's burden" and the consequences of colonization, which can be seen as unsettling and disturbing.
* The fifth and sixth lines create a sense of suspense, as they hint at the idea that the goal is near, but the outcome is uncertain.
* The last two lines return to a sense of uneasiness, as they describe the consequences of the "White Man's burden" and the loss of hope.

Note that this annotation is subjective and may vary depending on the individual reader's interpretation of the poem.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Take up the White Man"s burden - [Uneasiness]
No tawdry rule of kings, [Uneasiness]
But toil of serf and sweeper - [Uneasiness]
The tale of common things. [Sadness]
The ports ye shall not enter, [Suspense]
The roads ye shall not tread, [Suspense]
Go make them with your living, [Vitality]
And mark them with your dead ! [Sadness]
