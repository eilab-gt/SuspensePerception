This is a comprehensive guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guidelines provide a clear framework for annotators to label their subjective emotions while reading poems. Here's a breakdown of the guidelines:

**Labels and Categories**

The guidelines provide 9 labels, each corresponding to a specific category of emotion:

1. Annoyance
2. Awe/Sublime
3. Beauty/Joy
4. Humor
5. Nostalgia (to be used with another label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness)
6. Sadness
7. Suspense
8. Uneasiness
9. Vitality

**Instructions for Annotating**

1. Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
2. Label each line individually (not sentence).
3. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
4. Use as few emotions as possible.
5. Choose at least one label per line.
6. Do not use more than two labels per line.
7. Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
8. Choose another emotion if necessary.
9. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
10. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
11. Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness.

**Gold Standard**

The guidelines provide examples for each label, serving as an orientation for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels in different contexts.

**Annotating the Stanza**

The guidelines provide a sample stanza for annotation, and the annotator is expected to apply the labels according to the instructions and guidelines provided.

Overall, these guidelines provide a clear and structured approach to annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry, ensuring consistency and reliability in the annotation process.
To annotate the stanza, I will follow the guidelines provided. Here is my annotation:

Yet, if you enter the woods [Beauty/Joy]
Of a summer evening late, [Beauty/Joy]
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools [Beauty/Joy]
Where the otter whistles his mate, [Beauty/Joy]
(They fear not men in the woods, [Suspense]
Because they see so few.) [Suspense]
You will hear the beat of a horseâ€™s feet, [Vitality]
And the swish of a skirt in the dew, [Vitality]
Steadily cantering through [Vitality]
The misty solitudes, [Beauty/Joy]
As though they perfectly knew [Suspense]
The old lost road through the woods. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
But there is no road through the woods. [Sadness]

My annotation is based on the emotions I feel while reading each line. I have chosen the labels that best match my emotions, using the guidelines provided. Here's a brief explanation for each line:

* Lines 1-4: I feel a sense of beauty and joy, as the description of the woods is peaceful and serene.
* Line 5-6: I feel a sense of suspense, as the phrase "They fear not men in the woods" creates a sense of uncertainty.
* Lines 7-9: I feel a sense of vitality, as the description of the horse's feet and the swish of a skirt creates a sense of energy and movement.
* Line 10: I feel a sense of beauty and joy again, as the description of the misty solitudes is peaceful and serene.
* Line 11: I feel a sense of suspense, as the phrase "As though they perfectly knew" creates a sense of uncertainty.
* Lines 12-13: I feel a sense of nostalgia and sadness, as the phrase "The old lost road through the woods" evokes a sense of longing and loss, and the final line "But there is no road through the woods" reinforces this feeling of sadness.
