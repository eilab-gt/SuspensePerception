This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions evoked by reading poems. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding label. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - to be used with another label: +beauty/joy or +sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Notice that nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness

The gold standard examples provided serve as an orientation for the annotators, and can be referred to in case of doubt.

The task is to annotate the given stanza:

"I taste a liquor never brewed ,
From tankards scooped in pearl ;
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol !"

Please follow the guidelines and instructions to annotate the emotions evoked by this stanza.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Inebriate of air am I , [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
And debauchee of dew , [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Reeling , through endless summer days , [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
From inns of molten blue . [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning:

* The language used in the stanza is rich and evocative, with vivid imagery and a sense of freedom and abandon. This suggests a sense of beauty and joy, which is why I've chosen the Beauty/Joy label.
* The use of words like "inebriate", "debauchee", and "reeling" also suggests a sense of vitality and energy, which is why I've chosen the Vitality label as well.
* The overall tone of the stanza is one of carefree abandon and joy, which is why I haven't chosen any of the more negative labels like Annoyance, Sadness, or Uneasiness.

Note that this is just one possible annotation, and different annotators may have different interpretations of the same stanza.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

When landlords turn the drunken bee [Humor]
Out of the foxglove "s door , [Humor]
When butterflies renounce their drams , [Humor]
I shall but drink the more ! [Vitality]
