10. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

The guide provides examples for each label, serving as an orientation for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels in practice.

**Task:**

Annotate the provided stanza:

"Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice."

Please follow the instructions and guidelines to annotate this stanza with the corresponding emotions.
