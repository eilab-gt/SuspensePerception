This is a guidelines document for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels with corresponding items to help annotators identify and categorize their subjective emotions while reading poems. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labelling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Notice that nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness

The document also provides examples for each label, serving as a gold standard for annotators to refer to when in doubt.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Sighs which are from lovers blown [Beauty/Joy]
Do but gently heave the heart: [Beauty/Joy]
Ev'n the tears they shed alone [Sadness]
Cure, like trickling balm, their smart: [Beauty/Joy]
Lovers, when they lose their breath, [Sadness]
Bleed away in easy death. [Sadness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first two lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, as they describe the gentle and soothing effects of lovers' sighs.
* The third line introduces a sense of sadness, as it mentions tears being shed alone.
* The fourth line returns to a sense of beauty and joy, as it describes the tears as a "trickling balm" that cures the heart.
* The fifth and sixth lines introduce a sense of sadness again, as they describe the loss of breath and easy death of lovers.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is Beauty/Joy, with Sadness as a secondary emotion.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Love and Time with reverence use, [Beauty/Joy]
Treat them like a parting friend; [Beauty/Joy]
Nor the golden gifts refuse [Beauty/Joy]
Which in youth sincere they send: [Beauty/Joy]
For each year their price is more, [Sadness]
And they less simple than before. [Sadness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, as they describe the importance of cherishing love and time, and the value of the gifts they bring in youth.
* The last two lines introduce a sense of sadness, as they describe how the price of these gifts increases with each year, and how they become less simple and more complicated over time.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is Beauty/Joy, with Sadness as a secondary emotion.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Love, like spring-tides full and high, [Beauty/Joy]
Swells in every youthful vein; [Beauty/Joy]
But each tide does less supply, [Sadness]
Till they quite shrink in again: [Sadness]
If a flow in age appear, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
"Tis but rain, and runs not clear. [Sadness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first two lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, as they describe the abundance and vitality of love in youth.
* The third and fourth lines introduce a sense of sadness, as they describe how the flow of love decreases with age.
* The fifth line evokes a sense of nostalgia, as it mentions the appearance of love in age, but this nostalgia is tinged with sadness.
* The final line reinforces the sense of sadness, as it describes the flow of love as unclear and diminished.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is Beauty/Joy, with Sadness as a secondary emotion, and Nostalgia as a tertiary emotion.
