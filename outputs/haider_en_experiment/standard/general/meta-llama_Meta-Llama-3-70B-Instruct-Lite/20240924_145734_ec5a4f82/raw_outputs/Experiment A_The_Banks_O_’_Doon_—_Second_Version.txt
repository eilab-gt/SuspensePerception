This is a comprehensive guide for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides 9 labels for annotators to choose from, each corresponding to a specific category of emotion. The labels are:

1. Annoyance
2. Awe/Sublime
3. Beauty/Joy
4. Humor
5. Nostalgia (always used with an additional label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness)
6. Sadness
7. Suspense
8. Uneasiness
9. Vitality

For each label, the guide provides a brief description and examples to help annotators understand when to use each label. The guide also provides instructions for annotating, including:

* Annotate each line individually, not sentence by sentence
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line, but no more than two
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza, and add another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If changing the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion

The guide also provides a "Gold Standard" section with examples of annotated poems to serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to specific lines of poetry.

The final section of the guide provides a stanza for annotators to practice labeling. The stanza is:

"Ye flowery banks o’ bonie Doon,
How can ye blume sae fair?
How can ye chant, ye little birds,
And I sae fu’ o care!
Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
That sings upon the bough!
Thou minds me o’ the happy days
When my fause Luve was true.
Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
That sings beside thy mate;
For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
And wist na o’ my fate."

Annotators are encouraged to label each line of this stanza using the provided labels and guidelines.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon, [Beauty/Joy]
To see the woodbine twine; [Beauty/Joy]
And ilka bird sang o' its Luve, [Beauty/Joy]
And sae did I o' mine. [Beauty/Joy]
Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose, [Beauty/Joy]
Upon its thorny tree; [Beauty/Joy]
But my fause Luver staw my rose, [Sadness]
And left the thorn wi' me. [Sadness]
Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose, [Beauty/Joy]
Upon a morn in June; [Beauty/Joy]
And sae I flourished on the morn, [Vitality]
And sae was pu'd or noon. [Vitality]

Here's a breakdown of the annotations:

* Lines 1-4: The language and imagery evoke a sense of beauty and joy, with a focus on the natural world and the speaker's emotional response to it.
* Lines 5-6: The speaker's heart is "lightsome" and they pick a rose, which suggests a sense of beauty and joy. However, the rose is on a thorny tree, which introduces a hint of sadness.
* Lines 7-8: The speaker's "fause Luver" (false lover) takes the rose and leaves the thorn, which is a clear symbol of sadness and heartache.
* Lines 9-10: The speaker's heart is again "lightsome" and they pick another rose, which suggests a return to a sense of beauty and joy. The image of flourishing on the morning suggests vitality and energy.
* Line 11: The final line continues the theme of beauty and joy, with a sense of vitality and energy.

Overall, this stanza is dominated by emotions of beauty and joy, with a secondary theme of sadness and heartache. The vitality and energy of the final lines suggest a sense of hope and renewal.
