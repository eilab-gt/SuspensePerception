This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions they experience while reading poems. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding label. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

The gold standard provides examples for each label to serve as an orientation for annotators. When in doubt, refer to the gold standard.

The task is to annotate the given stanza:

"I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said : Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert ... Near them , on the sand ,
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown ,
And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command ,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things ,
The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed :
And on the pedestal these words appear :
‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings :
Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! ’
Nothing beside remains . Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away ."

Please annotate the stanza using the provided labels and instructions.
