This is a comprehensive guide for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides a set of 9 labels, each corresponding to a specific category of emotion, along with examples and instructions for annotating. Here's a breakdown of the guide:

**Labels and their corresponding emotions:**

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

**Instructions for annotating:**

* Annotate each line individually, not sentence by sentence.
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You can use up to two labels per line.
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

**Gold Standard Examples:**

The guide provides examples for each label, which serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to specific lines of poetry.

By following these guidelines and examples, annotators can ensure consistency and accuracy in labeling aesthetic emotions in poetry.
To annotate the stanza, I would label the emotions as follows:

Rose leaves , when the rose is dead , [Sadness]
Are heaped for the beloved "s bed ; [Beauty/Joy]
And so thy thoughts , when thou art gone , [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Love itself shall slumber on . [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "Rose leaves , when the rose is dead" evokes a sense of sadness and loss, so I labeled it with [Sadness].
* The second line "Are heaped for the beloved "s bed" suggests a sense of beauty and love, so I labeled it with [Beauty/Joy].
* The third line "And so thy thoughts , when thou art gone" has a nostalgic tone, evoking a sense of longing for something or someone that is no longer present. I labeled it with [Nostalgia] and [Sadness] because it's a bittersweet feeling.
* The fourth line "Love itself shall slumber on" suggests a sense of beauty and joy again, so I labeled it with [Beauty/Joy].

Note that these labels are subjective and may vary depending on individual interpretations.
