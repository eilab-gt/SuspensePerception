To annotate the given stanza, I will follow the guidelines provided. Here's my annotation:

I wandered through each chartered street , [Sadness]
Near where the chartered Thames does flow , [Sadness]
A mark in every face I meet , [Sadness] [Annoyance]
Marks of weakness , marks of woe . [Sadness] [Annoyance]

My reasoning for each line is as follows:

* The first line evokes a sense of sadness, as the speaker is wandering through a desolate, "chartered" street, implying a sense of confinement and restriction.
* The second line continues to evoke sadness, as the speaker is near the Thames, which may symbolize a sense of isolation or disconnection.
* The third line adds a sense of annoyance, as the speaker notes the marks of weakness and woe on every face they meet, implying a sense of frustration and despair.
* The fourth line reinforces the sadness and annoyance, as the speaker emphasizes the marks of weakness and woe, suggesting a sense of hopelessness and desperation.

Note that I've chosen to use two labels for the third and fourth lines, as the emotions of sadness and annoyance are both present and intertwined.
