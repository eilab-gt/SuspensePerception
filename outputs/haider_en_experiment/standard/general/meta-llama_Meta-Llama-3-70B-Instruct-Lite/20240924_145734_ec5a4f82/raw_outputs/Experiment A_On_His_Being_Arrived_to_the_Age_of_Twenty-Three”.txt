This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. It provides a set of 9 labels to categorize the emotions evoked by a poem, along with examples and instructions for annotators. Here's a breakdown of the guide:

**Labels and Descriptions**

1. **Annoyance**: feeling annoyed, frustrated, or angry while reading the line/stanza.
2. **Awe/Sublime**: feeling overwhelmed, inspired, or in awe of something sublime (e.g., god, death, life, truth).
3. **Beauty/Joy**: feeling pleasure, happiness, or joy while reading the line/stanza.
4. **Humor**: feeling amused or finding the line/stanza funny.
5. **Nostalgia**: feeling sentimental longing for the past (to be used with another label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness).
6. **Sadness**: feeling sad or touched by the line/stanza.
7. **Suspense**: feeling gripped or sparked by curiosity while reading the line/stanza.
8. **Uneasiness**: feeling discomfort, distaste, or fear while reading the line/stanza.
9. **Vitality**: feeling invigorated, inspired, or encouraged by the line/stanza.

**Instructions for Annotating**

1. Annotate your current feelings while reading each individual line (not sentence).
2. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
3. Use as few emotions as possible.
4. Choose at least one label per line.
5. You can use up to two labels per line.
6. Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
7. Choose another emotion if necessary.
8. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
9. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
10. Nostalgia must always be used with an additional label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness.
