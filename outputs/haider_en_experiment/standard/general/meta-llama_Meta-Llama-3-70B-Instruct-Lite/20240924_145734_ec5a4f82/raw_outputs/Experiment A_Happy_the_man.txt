This is a comprehensive guide for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding emotion. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The guide also provides instructions for annotating, including:

* Annotate each line individually, not by sentence
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line, but no more than two
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza, and add another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If changing the non-dominant emotion, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion
* Nostalgia should always be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness

The guide also includes examples of annotated poems, known as the "Gold Standard", to serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to specific lines of poetry.
