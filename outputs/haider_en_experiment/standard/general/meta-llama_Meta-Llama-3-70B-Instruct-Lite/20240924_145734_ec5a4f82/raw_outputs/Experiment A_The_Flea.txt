This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides a set of 9 labels for annotating emotions, along with examples and instructions for annotators. Here's a summary of the guide:

**Labels:**

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) (must be used with another label: beauty/joy or sadness)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

**Instructions for Annotating:**

1. Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
2. Label each line individually (not sentence).
3. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
4. Use as few emotions as possible.
5. Choose at least one label per line.
6. Do not use more than two labels per line.
7. Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
8. Choose another emotion if necessary.
9. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
10. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

**Gold Standard:**

The guide provides examples for each label, which serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples are highlighted in the text.

**Annotation Task:**

The annotator is asked to annotate the following stanza:

"Marke but this flea , and marke in this ,
How little that which thou deny"st me is ;
It suck "d me first , and now sucks thee ,
And in this flea , our two bloods mingled bee ;
Thou know"st that this cannot be said
A sinne , nor shame , nor losse of maidenhead ,
Yet this enjoyes before it wooe ,
And pamper "d swells with one blood made of two ,
And this , alas , is more then wee would doe ."

The annotator should follow the instructions and guidelines provided to label the emotions evoked by this stanza.
Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

Oh stay , three lives in one flea , [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Where wee almost , yea more then maryed are . [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
This flea is you and I , and this [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Our mariage bed , and mariage temple is ; [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Though parents grudge , and you , w"are met , [Annoyance] [Sadness]
And cloysterd in these living walls of Jet . [Uneasiness]
Though use make you apt to kill mee , [Uneasiness] [Annoyance]
Let not to that , selfe murder added bee , [Uneasiness] [Annoyance]
And sacrilege , three sinnes in killing three . [Uneasiness] [Annoyance]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

1. The first four lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, as well as vitality, as they describe the union of two people in a flea.
2. The fifth line introduces a sense of annoyance and sadness, as it mentions the grudge of parents.
3. The sixth line creates uneasiness, as it describes being enclosed in living walls of jet.
4. The seventh line increases the uneasiness and annoyance, as it mentions the possibility of killing.
5. The eighth line maintains the uneasiness and annoyance, as it adds the concept of self-murder.
6. The ninth line continues the uneasiness and annoyance, as it describes the sacrilege of killing three.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Cruell and sodaine , hast thou since [Annoyance] [Sadness]
Purpled thy naile , in blood of innocence ? [Annoyance] [Sadness]
Wherein could this flea guilty bee , [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Except in that drop which it suckt from thee ? [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Yet thou triumph"st , and saist that thou [Annoyance] [Sadness]
Find"st not thy selfe , nor mee the weaker now ; [Annoyance] [Sadness]
â€˜ Tis true , then learne how false , feares bee ; [Suspense]
Just so much honor , when thou yeeld"st to mee , [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Will wast , as this flea "s death tooke life from thee . [Uneasiness] [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

1. The first two lines evoke a sense of annoyance and sadness, as they describe cruelty and bloodshed.
2. The third and fourth lines create a sense of beauty and joy, as well as vitality, as they describe the flea's innocence.
3. The fifth and sixth lines return to a sense of annoyance and sadness, as they describe triumph and weakness.
4. The seventh line creates a sense of suspense, as it mentions false fears.
5. The eighth line returns to a sense of beauty and joy, as well as vitality, as it describes honor and yielding.
6. The ninth line ends with a sense of uneasiness and sadness, as it describes the flea's death and the taking of life.
