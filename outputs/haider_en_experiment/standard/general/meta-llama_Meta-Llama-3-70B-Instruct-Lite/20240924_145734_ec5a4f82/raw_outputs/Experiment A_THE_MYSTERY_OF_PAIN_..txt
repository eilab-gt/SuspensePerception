This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions they experience while reading poems. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding label. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

The gold standard examples are provided to serve as an orientation for the annotators. When in doubt, refer to the gold standard examples.

The task is to annotate the given stanza:

Pain has an element of blank ;
It cannot recollect
When it began , or if there were
A day when it was not .

Please follow the guidelines and instructions to annotate the stanza with the corresponding labels.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

It has no future but itself , [Sadness]
Its infinite realms contain [Uneasiness]
Its past , enlightened to perceive [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
New periods of pain . [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "It has no future but itself" evokes a sense of sadness and hopelessness, so I chose the label [Sadness].
* The second line "Its infinite realms contain" creates a sense of uneasiness and discomfort, possibly due to the ambiguity of the phrase "infinite realms", so I chose the label [Uneasiness].
* The third line "Its past , enlightened to perceive" has a nostalgic tone, evoking a sense of looking back at past experiences, so I chose the label [Nostalgia] in addition to [Sadness].
* The fourth line "New periods of pain" is a clear expression of pain and suffering, so I chose the label [Sadness].

Please note that annotation is subjective, and different annotators may have different interpretations of the same poem.
