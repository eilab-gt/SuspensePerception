This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions evoked by a poem. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding label. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

The gold standard provides examples for each label to serve as an orientation for annotators. When in doubt, refer to the gold standard.

The task is to annotate the given stanza:

"Of all the Poisons that the fruitful Earth
E"er yet brought forth , or Monsters she gave Birth ,
Nought to Mankind has e"er so fatal been ,
As thou , accursed Gold , their Care and Sin ."

Please follow the guidelines and instructions to annotate this stanza with the corresponding emotions.
To annotate the given stanza, I will follow the guidelines and instructions provided. Here is my annotation:

Methinks I the Advent'rous Merchant see, [Suspense]
Ploughing the faithless Seas, in search of thee, [Suspense]
His dearest Wife and Children left behind, [Sadness]
(His real Wealth) while he, a Slave to th' Wind, [Uneasiness]
Sometimes becalm'd, the Shore with longing Eyes [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Wishes to see, and what he wishes, Spies: [Suspense]
For a rude Tempest wakes him from his Dream, [Uneasiness]
And Strands his Bark by a more sad Extream. [Sadness]
Thus, hopeless Wretch, is his whole Life-time spent, [Sadness]
And though thrice Wreck't, 's no Wiser than he went. [Annoyance]
