This is a comprehensive guide for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides 9 labels for different emotions that readers may experience while reading poems, along with examples and instructions for annotating. Here's a summary of the guide:

**Labels and Descriptions:**

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

**Instructions for Annotating:**

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label each line individually (not sentence).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

**Gold Standard Examples:**

The guide provides examples for each label to serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to specific lines of poetry.

**Task:**

Annotate the provided stanza using the guidelines and labels:

"The flower that smiles to-day
To-morrow dies ;
All that we wish to stay
Tempts and then flies .
What is this world "s delight ?
Lightning that mocks the night ,
Brief even as bright ."

Please follow the instructions and choose the most suitable labels for each line.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Virtue , how frail it is ! [Sadness]
Friendship how rare ! [Sadness]
Love , how it sells poor bliss [Sadness]
For proud despair ! [Sadness]
But we , though soon they fall , [Vitality]
Survive their joy , and all [Beauty/Joy]
Which ours we call . [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* "Virtue , how frail it is !" - This line makes me feel sad, as it highlights the fragility of virtue.
* "Friendship how rare !" - This line also makes me feel sad, as it emphasizes the rarity of true friendship.
* "Love , how it sells poor bliss" - This line continues the theme of sadness, as it suggests that love is often fleeting and unsatisfying.
* "For proud despair !" - This line maintains the sad tone, with a sense of desperation and hopelessness.
* "But we , though soon they fall ," - This line shifts the tone to one of vitality, as it suggests a sense of resilience and perseverance.
* "Survive their joy , and all" - This line evokes feelings of beauty and joy, as it suggests that even in the face of adversity, we can find happiness and fulfillment.
* "Which ours we call ." - This final line continues the theme of beauty and joy, as it emphasizes the importance of holding onto what is truly ours.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Whilst skies are blue and bright , [Beauty/Joy]
Whilst flowers are gay , [Beauty/Joy]
Whilst eyes that change ere night [Sadness]
Make glad the day ; [Beauty/Joy]
Whilst yet the calm hours creep , [Vitality]
Dream thou — and from thy sleep [Vitality]
Then wake to weep . [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* "Whilst skies are blue and bright ," - This line evokes feelings of beauty and joy, as it describes a pleasant and uplifting scene.
* "Whilst flowers are gay ," - This line continues the theme of beauty and joy, as it adds to the idyllic atmosphere.

* "Dream thou — and from thy sleep" - This line continues the theme of vitality, as it encourages the reader to be active and engaged.
* "Then wake to weep ." - This final line ends on a note of sadness, as it suggests that even in the midst of beauty and joy, sorrow is always present.
