This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. It provides a set of 9 labels with corresponding items to help annotators identify and label their subjective emotions while reading poems. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - to be used with another label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The guide provides instructions for annotating, including:

* Annotate after reading each individual line, not sentence.
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line.
* Do not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.

The guide also provides examples of annotated poems, known as the "Gold Standard," to serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to specific lines of poetry.

The final section of the guide provides a stanza for annotation, allowing the annotator to practice applying the labels to a poem.
