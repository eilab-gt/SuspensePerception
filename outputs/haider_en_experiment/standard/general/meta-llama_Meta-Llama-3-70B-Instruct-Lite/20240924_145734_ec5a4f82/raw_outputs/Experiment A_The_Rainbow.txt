This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides a set of 9 labels for annotators to use when reading poems, along with examples and instructions for each label. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are as follows:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labelling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Notice that nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

The gold standard examples provided serve as an orientation for the annotators, and can be used as a reference when in doubt.
