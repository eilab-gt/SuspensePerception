This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides 9 labels for annotators to use when reading poems, along with examples and instructions to ensure consistency and accuracy. Here's a breakdown of the guide:

**Labels and Descriptions**

1. **Annoyance**: Feeling annoyed, frustrated, or angry while reading the line/stanza.
2. **Awe/Sublime**: Feeling overwhelmed, inspired, or in awe of something grand or sublime.
3. **Beauty/Joy**: Feeling pleasure, happiness, or joy while reading the line/stanza.
4. **Humor**: Finding the line/stanza funny or amusing.
5. **Nostalgia**: Feeling nostalgic, sentimental, or longing for something in the past (must be used with another label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness).
6. **Sadness**: Feeling sad, touched, or moved to sorrow.

8. **Uneasiness**: Feeling uncomfortable, unsettled, disturbed, or frightened by the line/stanza.

**Instructions for Annotating**

1. Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
2. Label each line individually (not sentence).
3. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
4. Use as few emotions as possible.
5. Choose at least one label per line.
6. Do not use more than two labels per line.
7. Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
8. Choose another emotion if necessary.
9. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
10. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

**Gold Standard Examples**

The guide provides examples for each label to serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples can be used as a reference when in doubt.

**Annotating the Given Stanza**

The guide concludes with a stanza for annotators to practice labeling. The stanza is:

"In vain, in vain — the all-composing Hour
Resistless falls: the Muse obeys the Pow'r.
She comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold
Of Night primæval and of Chaos old!
Before her, Fancy's gilded clouds decay,
And all its varying Rain-bows die away.
Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires,
The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.
As one by one, at dread Medea's strain,
The sick'ning stars fade off th' ethereal plain;
As Argus' eyes by Hermes' wand opprest,
Clos'd one by one to everlasting rest;
Thus at her felt approach, and secret might,
Art after Art goes out, and all is Night.
See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,
Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head!
Philosophy, that lean'd on Heav'n before,
Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.
Physic of Metaphysic begs defence,
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense!
See Mystery to Mathematics fly!
In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.
Religion blushing veils her sacred fires,
And unawares Morality expires.
For public Flame, nor private, dares to shine;
Nor human Spark is left, nor Glimpse divine!
Lo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restor'd;
Light dies before thy uncreating word;
Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall,
And universal Darkness buries All."

Annotators are encouraged to label this stanza using the provided labels and instructions.
