This is a comprehensive guide for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides a set of 9 labels, each corresponding to a specific category of emotion, along with examples and instructions for annotating. Here's a summary of the guide:

**Labels and Descriptions:**

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)

**Instructions for Annotating:**

1. Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
2. Label each line individually (not sentence).
3. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
4. Use as few emotions as possible.
5. Choose at least one label per line.
6. Do not use more than two labels per line.
7. Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
8. Choose another emotion if necessary.
9. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
10. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
