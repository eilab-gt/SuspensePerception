This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions triggered by reading poems. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding label. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label each line individually (not sentence).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

The gold standard provides examples for each label to guide annotators in their annotation.
