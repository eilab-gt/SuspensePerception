**Labels and Descriptions:**

1. **Annoyance**: Feeling annoyed, frustrated, or angry while reading the line/stanza.
2. **Awe/Sublime**: Feeling overwhelmed, inspired, or in awe while reading the line/stanza.
3. **Beauty/Joy**: Feeling pleasure, happiness, or joy while reading the line/stanza.
4. **Humor**: Feeling amused or finding the line/stanza funny.

**Instructions for Annotating:**

1. Annotate your current feelings while reading each individual line (not sentence).
2. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
3. Use as few emotions as possible.
4. Choose at least one label per line.
5. You can use up to two labels per line.
6. Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
7. If necessary, choose another emotion.
8. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
9. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
10. Nostalgia must always be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.
