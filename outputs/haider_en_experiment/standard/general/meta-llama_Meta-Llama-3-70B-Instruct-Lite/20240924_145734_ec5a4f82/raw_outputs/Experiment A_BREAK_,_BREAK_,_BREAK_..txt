This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions evoked by a poem. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding emotion. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem
* Label each line individually (not sentence)
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line
* Do not use more than two labels per line
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza
* Choose another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion

The gold standard examples provided serve as an orientation for the annotators, and can be referred to in case of doubt.

The task is to annotate the given stanza:

"Break, break, break,
On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
And I would that my tongue could utter
The thoughts that arise in me."

Please follow the guidelines and instructions to annotate the stanza with the corresponding emotions.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

O well for the fisherman "s boy , [Beauty/Joy]
That he shouts with his sister at play ! [Beauty/Joy]
O well for the sailor lad , [Beauty/Joy]
That he sings in his boat on the bay ! [Beauty/Joy]

The dominant emotion evoked by this stanza is Beauty/Joy, as the language used is playful and carefree, evoking a sense of happiness and joy. The use of words like "shouts", "play", and "sings" creates a lively and upbeat atmosphere, which contributes to the overall feeling of beauty and joy.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

And the stately ships go on [Beauty/Joy]
To their haven under the hill ; [Beauty/Joy]
But O for the touch of a vanish "d hand , [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
And the sound of a voice that is still ! [Sadness] [Nostalgia]

The dominant emotion evoked by the first two lines is Beauty/Joy, as the language used is stately and serene, evoking a sense of calmness and beauty. The use of words like "stately" and "haven" creates a sense of peace and tranquility, which contributes to the overall feeling of beauty and joy.

The dominant emotion evoked by the last two lines is Sadness, as the language used is nostalgic and longing, evoking a sense of loss and yearning. The use of words like "vanish'd" and "still" creates a sense of melancholy and nostalgia, which contributes to the overall feeling of sadness. The label Nostalgia is added to indicate that the sadness is accompanied by a sentimental longing for something or someone from the past.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Break , break , break , [Sadness]
At the foot of thy crags , O Sea ! [Awe/Sublime]
But the tender grace of a day that is dead [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
Will never come back to me . [Sadness] [Nostalgia]

The dominant emotion evoked by the first line is Sadness, as the repetition of "break" creates a sense of despair and hopelessness.

The dominant emotion evoked by the second line is Awe/Sublime, as the image of the sea and the crags creates a sense of grandeur and power.

The dominant emotion evoked by the last two lines is Sadness, as the language used is nostalgic and melancholic, evoking a sense of loss and longing. The label Nostalgia is added to indicate that the sadness is accompanied by a sentimental longing for something or someone from the past.
