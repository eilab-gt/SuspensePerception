This is a guidelines document for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels for annotating emotions, along with examples and instructions for annotators. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) (must be used with another label: beauty/joy or sadness)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem
* Label each line individually (not sentence)
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line
* You should not use more than two labels per line
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza
* Choose another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion

The gold standard examples provided are meant to serve as an orientation for annotators, and can be used as a reference when in doubt.

The task is to annotate the following stanza:

O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
But O heart! heart! heart!
O the bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.

Please annotate the stanza using the provided labels and instructions.
Here is the annotated stanza:

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; [Vitality]
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, [Vitality]
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, [Beauty/Joy]
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; [Vitality]
Here Captain! dear father! [Sadness]
This arm beneath your head! [Sadness]
It is some dream that on the deck, [Suspense]
You’ve fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]

Note: The dominant emotion in this stanza is Sadness, but there are also elements of Vitality and Beauty/Joy. The use of "O Captain! my Captain!" and "Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills" suggests a sense of urgency and energy, which is why I chose Vitality for those lines. The image of "bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths" is beautiful and joyful, which is why I chose Beauty/Joy for that line. The rest of the stanza is more somber and sad, with the speaker mourning the loss of their captain.
Here is the annotated stanza:

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, [Sadness]
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, [Sadness]
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, [Vitality]
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; [Vitality]
Exult O shores, and ring O bells! [Beauty/Joy]
But I with mournful tread, [Sadness]
Walk the deck my Captain lies, [Sadness]
Fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]

Note: The dominant emotion in this stanza is Sadness, but there are also elements of Vitality and Beauty/Joy. The lines "The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done" and "From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won" suggest a sense of accomplishment and victory, which is why I chose Vitality for those lines. The line "Exult O shores, and ring O bells!" is joyful and celebratory, which is why I chose Beauty/Joy for that line. The rest of the stanza is more somber and sad, with the speaker mourning the loss of their captain.
