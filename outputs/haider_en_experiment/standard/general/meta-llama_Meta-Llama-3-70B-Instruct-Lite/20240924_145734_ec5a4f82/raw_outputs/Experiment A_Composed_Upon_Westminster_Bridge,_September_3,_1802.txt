This is a guidelines document for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels for annotating emotions, along with instructions and examples to help annotators label their subjective emotions while reading poems. The labels are:

1. Annoyance
2. Awe/Sublime
3. Beauty/Joy
4. Humor
5. Nostalgia (to be used with another label: beauty/joy or sadness)
6. Sadness
7. Suspense
8. Uneasiness
9. Vitality

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

The gold standard examples provided serve as an orientation for the annotators, and they should be referred to when in doubt.

The final section of the document provides a stanza for annotation, with the task of annotating the emotions evoked by the poem.
