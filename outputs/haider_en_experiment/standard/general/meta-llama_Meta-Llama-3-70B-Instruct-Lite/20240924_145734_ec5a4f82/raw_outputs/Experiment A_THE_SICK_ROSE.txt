Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

O rose , thou art sick ! [Sadness]
The invisible worm , [Uneasiness]
That flies in the night , [Suspense]
In the howling storm , [Uneasiness]

Here's my reasoning:

* "O rose , thou art sick !" evokes a sense of sadness, as the speaker is lamenting the rose's illness.
* "The invisible worm" creates a sense of uneasiness, as the idea of an unseen, potentially threatening presence is unsettling.
* "That flies in the night" sparks my interest and creates a sense of suspense, as I wonder what this worm might be doing in the night.
* "In the howling storm" reinforces the sense of uneasiness, as the storm creates a sense of turmoil and danger.

Note that I've chosen only one or two labels per line, as instructed, and tried to capture the dominant emotion in each case.
