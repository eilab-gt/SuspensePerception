This is a comprehensive guide for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides 9 labels for different emotions, along with examples and instructions for annotating. Here's a summary of the labels and their corresponding emotions:

1. **Annoyance**: feeling annoyed, frustrated, or angry while reading the line/stanza.
2. **Awe/Sublime**: feeling overwhelmed, inspired, or in awe of something grand or sublime.
3. **Beauty/Joy**: feeling pleasure, happiness, or joy while reading the line/stanza.
4. **Humor**: feeling amused, entertained, or finding the line/stanza funny.
5. **Nostalgia**: feeling sentimental longing for the past, often accompanied by beauty/joy or sadness.
6. **Sadness**: feeling sad, touched, or moved to tears while reading the line/stanza.
7. **Suspense**: feeling gripped, interested, or curious about the line/stanza.
8. **Uneasiness**: feeling uncomfortable, disturbed, or unsettled while reading the line/stanza.
9. **Vitality**: feeling invigorated, inspired, or energized by the line/stanza.

The instructions for annotating emphasize the importance of:

* Labeling emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence)
* Reading the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Using as few emotions as possible
* Choosing at least one label per line, but no more than two
* Selecting the dominant emotion and, if necessary, an additional emotion
* Changing the dominant emotion within a stanza only when unavoidable
* Using nostalgia with an additional label (beauty/joy or sadness)

The gold standard examples provided serve as a reference for annotators, helping them to understand how to apply the labels in different contexts.
