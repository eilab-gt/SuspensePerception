This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions evoked by reading poems. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own category and items to help annotators choose the right label. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem
* Label each line individually (not sentence)
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line
* Do not use more than two labels per line
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza
* Choose another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness

The gold standard provides examples for each label to serve as an orientation for annotators. When in doubt, refer to the gold standard.

The task is to annotate the given stanza:

A noiseless patient spider ,
I mark "d where on a little promontory it stood isolated ,
Mark "d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding ,
It launch "d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself ,
Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them .

Please annotate the stanza using the provided labels and guidelines.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

And you O my soul where you stand , [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]
Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space , [Awe/Sublime] [Vitality]
Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to [Vitality]
connect them ,
Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold , [Vitality]
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul . [Beauty/Joy] [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "And you O my soul where you stand" evokes a sense of beauty and joy, as well as a sense of vitality and energy.
* The second line "Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space" inspires a sense of awe and sublimity, as well as a sense of vitality and expansiveness.
* The third line "Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to" conveys a sense of vitality and energy, as the speaker is actively seeking to connect with the universe.
* The fourth and fifth lines "connect them , Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold" continue to evoke a sense of vitality and energy, as the speaker is actively working to create connections and find stability.
* The final line "Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul" returns to a sense of beauty and joy, as well as a sense of vitality and energy, as the speaker is seeking to connect with their own soul.

Overall, the dominant emotions in this stanza are Beauty/Joy and Vitality, with Awe/Sublime playing a supporting role in the second line.
