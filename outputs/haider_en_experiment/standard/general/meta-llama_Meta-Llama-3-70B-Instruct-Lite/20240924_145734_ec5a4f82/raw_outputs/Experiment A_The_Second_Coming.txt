This is a guidelines document for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels, each corresponding to a category of emotion, along with examples and instructions for annotating. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness.

The gold standard examples provided serve as an orientation for the annotators, and they should be referred to in case of doubt.

The final task is to annotate the given stanza:

"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity."

Annotators should label each line with the corresponding emotion(s) according to the guidelines and examples provided.
Here is the annotated stanza:

• Surely some revelation is at hand; [Suspense]
• Surely the Second Coming is at hand. [Suspense]
• The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out [Uneasiness] [Suspense] 
• When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
• Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert [Uneasiness] [Suspense] 
• A shape with lion body and the head of a man, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
• A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
• Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it [Uneasiness] [Suspense] 
• Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
• The darkness drops again; but now I know [Sadness]
• That twenty centuries of stony sleep [Sadness]
• Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, [Uneasiness] [Sadness]
• And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
• Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? [Suspense]

Note: The dominant emotion in this stanza is Suspense, with a mix of Uneasiness and Sadness. The annotator felt a sense of foreboding and unease while reading the stanza, with a sense of anticipation and curiosity about the "Second Coming". The language and imagery used in the stanza create a sense of tension and uncertainty, which is reflected in the chosen emotions.
