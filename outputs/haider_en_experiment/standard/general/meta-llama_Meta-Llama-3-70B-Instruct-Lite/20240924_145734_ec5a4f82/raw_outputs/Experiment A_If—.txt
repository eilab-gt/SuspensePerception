This is a guidelines document for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels with corresponding items to help annotators identify and categorize their subjective emotions while reading poems. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The guidelines instruct annotators to:

* Label their emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence)
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line
* Not use more than two labels per line
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza
* Choose another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If changing the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion
* Nostalgia should always be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness

The document also provides examples of annotated poems to serve as a gold standard for annotators.
Here is the annotated stanza:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; [Vitality]
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; [Vitality]
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster [Suspense]
And treat those two impostors just the same; [Vitality]
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken [Sadness]
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, [Annoyance]
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, [Sadness]
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: [Vitality]

Rationale:

* The first two lines evoke a sense of vitality, as they encourage the reader to think and dream without being controlled by their thoughts and dreams.
* The third line creates a sense of suspense, as it introduces the idea of meeting with triumph and disaster.
* The fourth line returns to a sense of vitality, as it advises the reader to treat triumph and disaster equally.
* The fifth line evokes sadness, as it mentions the pain of hearing the truth being twisted.
* The sixth line annoys, as it describes the act of twisting the truth as a trap for fools.
* The seventh line again evokes sadness, as it describes the pain of seeing things broken.
* The eighth line returns to a sense of vitality, as it encourages the reader to build things back up with worn-out tools.
Here is the annotated stanza:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings [Vitality]
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, [Suspense]
And lose, and start again at your beginnings [Sadness]
And never breathe a word about your loss; [Annoyance]
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew [Vitality]
To serve your turn long after they are gone, [Vitality]
And so hold on when there is nothing in you [Vitality]
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ [Vitality]

Rationale:

* The first line evokes a sense of vitality, as it encourages the reader to take risks and make bold moves.
* The second line creates a sense of suspense, as it introduces the idea of risk and uncertainty.

Here is the annotated stanza:

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, [Vitality]
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, [Vitality]
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, [Vitality]
If all men count with you, but none too much; [Vitality]
If you can fill the unforgiving minute [Vitality]
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, [Vitality]
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, [Awe/Sublime]
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! [Vitality]

Rationale:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of vitality, as they encourage the reader to be confident and self-assured in their interactions with others.
