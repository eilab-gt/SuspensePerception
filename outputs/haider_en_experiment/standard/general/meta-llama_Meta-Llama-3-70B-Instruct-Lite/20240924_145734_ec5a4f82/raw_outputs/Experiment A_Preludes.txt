**Instructions for Annotating:**

* Use as few emotions as possible!
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.

The document provides examples for each label, which serve as an orientation for the annotators. The examples are highlighted to show the correct labeling.

**Task:**

Annotate the provided stanza:

"The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways .
Six o"clock .
The burnt-out ends of smoky days .
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots ;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots ,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps .
And then the lighting of the lamps ."

Please follow the guidelines and instructions to annotate the emotions in this stanza.
Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the provided stanza:

The morning comes to consciousness [Uneasiness]
Of faint stale smells of beer [Uneasiness]
From the sawdust-trampled street [Uneasiness]
With all its muddy feet that press [Uneasiness]
To early coffee-stands . [Beauty/Joy]
With the other masquerades [Uneasiness]
That time resumes , [Suspense]
One thinks of all the hands [Sadness]
That are raising dingy shades [Uneasiness]
In a thousand furnished rooms . [Uneasiness]
