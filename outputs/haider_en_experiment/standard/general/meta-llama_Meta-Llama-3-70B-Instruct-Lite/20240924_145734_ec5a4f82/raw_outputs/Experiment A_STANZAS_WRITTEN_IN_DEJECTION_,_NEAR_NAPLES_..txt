This is a guidelines document for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels for annotating emotions, along with examples and instructions for annotators. The labels are:

1. Annoyance
2. Awe/Sublime
3. Beauty/Joy
4. Humor
5. Nostalgia (always used with another label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness)
6. Sadness
7. Suspense
8. Uneasiness
9. Vitality

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
* Label each line individually (not sentence).
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line.
* Do not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

The gold standard examples provided serve as an orientation for the annotators, and can be used as a reference when in doubt.

The task is to annotate the given stanza:

"The sun is warm , the sky is clear ,
The waves are dancing fast and bright ,
Blue isles and snowy mountains wear
The purple noon "s transparent might ,
The breath of the moist earth is light ,
Around its unexpanded buds ;
Like many a voice of one delight ,
The winds , the birds , the ocean floods ,
The City "s voice itself , is soft like Solitude "s ."

Annotators should read the stanza, identify the emotions evoked, and label each line with the corresponding emotion(s) from the provided list.
Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

"I see the Deep "s untrampled floor
[Beauty/Joy] [Awe/Sublime]
With green and purple seaweeds strown ; [Beauty/Joy] [Awe/Sublime]
I see the waves upon the shore , [Beauty/Joy] [Awe/Sublime]
Like light dissolved in star-showers , thrown : [Beauty/Joy] [Awe/Sublime]
I sit upon the sands alone ,— [Sadness]
The lightning of the noontide ocean [Vitality]
Is flashing round me , and a tone [Vitality]
Arises from its measured motion , [Vitality]
How sweet ! did any heart now share in my emotion . [Beauty/Joy] [Nostalgia]"

Here's my annotation:

* Lines 1-4: I felt a sense of beauty and joy, and also a sense of awe and sublimity, as the description of the ocean floor and waves is vivid and evocative.
* Line 5: The tone shifts to one of sadness, as the speaker is sitting alone on the sands.
* Lines 6-8: The description of the lightning and its motion is invigorating and vital, conveying a sense of energy and movement.
* Line 9: The final line evokes a sense of beauty and joy, and also nostalgia, as the speaker reflects on sharing their emotion with others.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Alas ! I have nor hope nor health , [Sadness]
Nor peace within nor calm around , [Sadness]
Nor that content surpassing wealth [Sadness]
The sage in meditation found , [Beauty/Joy]
And walked with inward glory crowned — [Beauty/Joy]
Nor fame , nor power , nor love , nor leisure . [Sadness]
Others I see whom these surround — [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Smiling they live , and call life pleasure ;— [Beauty/Joy]
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure . [Sadness]

Here's my annotation:

* Lines 1-4: The tone is sad, as the speaker laments the lack of hope, health, peace, and contentment.
* Lines 5-6: The image of the sage in meditation is beautiful and joyful, conveying a sense of inner peace and glory.
* Line 7: The tone returns to sadness, as the speaker feels a sense of longing for the things they lack.
* Line 8: The nostalgia label is added, as the speaker seems to be reminiscing about others who have what they lack, and this nostalgia is tinged with sadness.
* Line 9: The final line is again sad, as the speaker reflects on their own circumstances.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Yet now despair itself is mild , [Sadness]
Even as the winds and waters are ; [Sadness]
I could lie down like a tired child , [Sadness]
And weep away the life of care [Sadness]
Which I have borne and yet must bear , [Sadness]
Till death like sleep might steal on me , [Sadness] [Suspense]
And I might feel in the warm air [Beauty/Joy]
My cheek grow cold , and hear the sea [Uneasiness]
Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony . [Sadness]

Here's my annotation:

* Lines 1-5: The tone is sad, as the speaker describes their despair and emotional exhaustion.
* Line 6: The introduction of death adds a sense of suspense, as the speaker contemplates their own mortality.
* Line 7: The image of feeling the warm air is a brief moment of beauty and joy, but it's fleeting.
* Line 8: The sound of the sea is unsettling and creates a sense of uneasiness.
* Line 9: The final line returns to sadness, as the speaker's "dying brain" is a poignant and melancholic image.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Some might lament that I were cold, [Sadness]
As I, when this sweet day is gone, [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
Which my lost heart, too soon grown old, [Sadness]
Insults with this untimely moan; [Sadness]
They might lament — for I am one [Sadness]
Whom men love not,— and yet regret, [Sadness]
Unlike this day, which, when the sun [Beauty/Joy]
Shall on its stainless glory set, [Beauty/Joy]
Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet. [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my annotation:

* Lines 1-5: The tone is sad, as the speaker describes their emotional pain and regret.
* Line 6: The phrase "Whom men love not" adds to the sense of sadness and isolation.
* Line 7: The image of the sun is a moment of beauty and joy, a contrast to the speaker's emotional pain.
* Line 8: The final line is a nostalgic reflection on the joy of the past, with a sense of beauty and joy.

Note: I've used the label "Nostalgia" in addition to "Sadness" in lines 2 and 8, as the poem evokes a sense of longing for the past.
