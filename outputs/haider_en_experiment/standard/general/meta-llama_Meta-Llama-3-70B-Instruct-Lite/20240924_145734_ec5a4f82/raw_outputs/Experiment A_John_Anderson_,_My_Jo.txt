This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides clear instructions and examples for each of the 9 labels, which are:

1. Annoyance
2. Awe/Sublime
3. Beauty/Joy
4. Humor
5. Nostalgia (always used with an additional label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness)
6. Sadness
7. Suspense
8. Uneasiness
9. Vitality

The guide emphasizes the importance of annotating each line individually, considering the entire stanza, and using as few emotions as possible. The annotators are encouraged to choose the dominant emotion and, if necessary, an additional emotion. The guide also provides examples of annotated poems to serve as a gold standard for the annotators.

The instructions for annotating are as follows:

* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Label your emotions after reading each individual line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line.
* You should not use more than two labels per line.
* Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
* Choose another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza, if unavoidable.
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

The guide also provides examples for each label, which serve as a reference for the annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to specific lines of poetry.

Overall, this guide provides a clear and comprehensive framework for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the annotation process.
Let's annotate the given stanza:

John Anderson, my jo, John, [Beauty/Joy]
We clamb the hill thegither; [Beauty/Joy]
And mony a cantie day, John, [Beauty/Joy]
We've had wi' ane anither: [Beauty/Joy]
Now we maun totter down, John, [Sadness]
And hand in hand we'll go, [Beauty/Joy]
And sleep thegither at the foot, [Beauty/Joy]
John Anderson, my jo. [Beauty/Joy]

Rationale:

* The stanza has a nostalgic and joyful tone, evoking feelings of happiness and beauty.
* The use of "my jo" and "John" creates a sense of intimacy and familiarity, which adds to the joyful atmosphere.
* The image of climbing the hill together and having "mony a cantie day" creates a sense of shared experience and happiness.
* The line "Now we maun totter down, John" introduces a sense of sadness and decline, but it is still accompanied by the overall joyful tone.
* The final lines, "And hand in hand we'll go, / And sleep thegither at the foot, / John Anderson, my jo" reinforce the sense of beauty and joy.

Note: The annotation is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's emotional response to the poem.
