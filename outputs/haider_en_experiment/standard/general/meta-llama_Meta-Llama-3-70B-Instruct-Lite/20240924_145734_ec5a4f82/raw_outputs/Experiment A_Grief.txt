This is a guidelines document for annotators labeling aesthetic emotions in poetry. The document provides a set of 9 labels for annotating emotions, along with instructions and examples to guide the annotators in labeling their subjective emotions. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - to be used with another label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The instructions for annotating are:

* Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem
* Label each line individually (not sentence)
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line
* Do not use more than two labels per line
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza
* Choose another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion
* Nostalgia always has to be used with an additional label: beauty/joy or sadness

The document also provides examples of annotated poems to serve as a gold standard for the annotators.
