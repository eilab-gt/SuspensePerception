This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding emotion. The labels are:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - to be used with another label: beauty/joy or sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

The guide also provides instructions for annotating, including:

* Annotate after reading each individual line (not sentence)
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line
* Use as few emotions as possible
* Choose at least one label per line
* Do not use more than two labels per line
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza
* Choose another emotion if necessary
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable
* If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion

The guide also provides examples of annotated poems to serve as a gold standard for annotators. These examples demonstrate how to apply the labels to different poems and stanzas.

For the given stanza, the annotation could be:

Nor dread nor hope attend [Sadness]
A dying animal; [Sadness]
A man awaits his end [Sadness]
Dreading and hoping all; [Sadness]
Many times he died, [Sadness]
Many times rose again, [Vitality]
A great man in his pride [Vitality]
Confronting murderous men [Annoyance]
Casts derision upon [Annoyance]
Supersession of breath; [Sadness]
He knows death to the bone â€“ [Sadness]
Man has created death. [Sadness]

Note that the annotation is subjective and may vary depending on the annotator's personal experience and interpretation of the poem.
