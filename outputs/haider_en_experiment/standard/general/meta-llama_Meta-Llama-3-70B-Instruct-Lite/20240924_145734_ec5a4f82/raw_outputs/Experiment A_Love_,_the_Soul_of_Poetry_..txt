This is a comprehensive guide for annotators to label aesthetic emotions in poetry. The guide provides clear instructions and examples to help annotators identify and categorize their subjective emotions while reading poems. Here's a summary of the guidelines:

**Labels and Categories:**

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - always used with another label: Beauty/Joy or Sadness
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)
7. Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

**Instructions for Annotating:**

1. Reflect your current feelings while reading the poem.
2. Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
3. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
4. Use as few emotions as possible.
5. Choose at least one label per line.
6. You should not use more than two labels per line.
7. Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza.
8. Choose another emotion if necessary.
9. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
10. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

**Gold Standard:**

The guide provides examples for each label, which serve as an orientation for annotators. These examples can be used as a reference when in doubt.

By following these guidelines, annotators can ensure consistency and accuracy in labeling aesthetic emotions in poetry, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of how readers experience and respond to poetry.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

But Love these Thoughts , like Mists , did soon disperse , [Beauty/Joy]
Enlarg "d his Fancy , and set free his Muse , [Vitality]
Biding him more Illustrious Subjects choose ; [Vitality]
The Acts of Gods , and God-like Men reherse . [Awe/Sublime]
From thence new Raptures did his Breast inspire , [Beauty/Joy]
His scarce Warm-Heart converted was to Fire . [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line has a sense of beauty and joy, with the use of the word "Love" and the comparison of thoughts to "Mists" which creates a sense of lightness and airiness.
* The second line has a sense of vitality, with the idea of the poet's "Fancy" being set free and his "Muse" being inspired.
* The third line continues the theme of vitality, with the poet choosing "Illustrious Subjects" to write about.
* The fourth line has a sense of awe and sublimity, with the reference to "The Acts of Gods" and "God-like Men" which creates a sense of grandeur and majesty.
* The fifth line returns to a sense of beauty and joy, with the idea of "new Raptures" inspiring the poet's breast.
* The sixth line has a sense of vitality, with the image of the poet's "Warm-Heart" being converted to "Fire", which suggests a sense of passion and energy.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Th' exalted Poet rais'd by this new Flame, [Vitality]
With Vigor flys, where late he crept along, [Vitality]
And Acts Divine, in a Diviner Song, [Awe/Sublime]
Commits to the eternal Trompe of Fame. [Vitality]
And thus Alexis does prove Love to be, [Beauty/Joy]
As the Worlds Soul, the Soul of Poetry. [Awe/Sublime]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line has a sense of vitality, with the image of the poet being "rais'd" and "flys" suggesting a sense of energy and movement.
* The second line continues the theme of vitality, with the idea of the poet moving with "Vigor" and "flys" suggesting a sense of power and strength.
* The third line has a sense of awe and sublimity, with the reference to "Acts Divine" and "Diviner Song" creating a sense of grandeur and majesty.
* The fourth line has a sense of vitality, with the idea of the poet committing to "the eternal Trompe of Fame" suggesting a sense of ambition and drive.
* The fifth line has a sense of beauty and joy, with the idea of Alexis "proving Love to be" suggesting a sense of warmth and connection.
* The sixth line has a sense of awe and sublimity, with the reference to "the Worlds Soul, the Soul of Poetry" creating a sense of grandeur and majesty.
