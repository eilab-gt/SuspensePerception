To annotate the given stanza, I will follow the guidelines and instructions provided. Here's my annotation:

Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast [Beauty/Joy]
In a field I looked into going past, [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
And the ground almost covered smooth in snow, [Beauty/Joy]
But a few weeds and stubble showing last. [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning for each line is as follows:

* The first line evokes a sense of beauty and joy, as the image of snow falling and night falling fast creates a peaceful and serene atmosphere.
* The second line makes me feel nostalgic, as it reminds me of a past experience or a memory, and it's also beautiful and joyful, as it's a reflection on the past.
* The third line continues to evoke a sense of beauty and joy, as the image of the ground covered in snow is calming and peaceful.
* The fourth line maintains the beauty and joy, as the image of the weeds and stubble showing last adds a sense of serenity to the scene.

Note that I've chosen to use the "Beauty/Joy" label for most of the lines, as the imagery and atmosphere of the stanza evoke a sense of peace and serenity. The "Nostalgia" label is added to the second line, as it has a nostalgic tone to it.
Here is my annotation of the given stanza:

The woods around it have it--it is theirs. [Beauty/Joy]
All animals are smothered in their lairs. [Uneasiness]
I am too absent-spirited to count; [Sadness]
The loneliness includes me unawares. [Sadness]

My reasoning for each line is as follows:

* The first line evokes a sense of beauty and joy, as the image of the woods and the animals having their own space is peaceful and serene.
* The second line makes me feel uneasy, as the image of animals being smothered in their lairs is unsettling and disturbing.
* The third line makes me feel sad, as the speaker's absent-spiritedness and inability to count implies a sense of disconnection and isolation.
* The fourth line continues to evoke sadness, as the speaker's loneliness is included in the scene, implying a sense of melancholy and despair.

Note that I've chosen to use a mix of labels to reflect the different emotions evoked by each line, with a focus on beauty/joy, uneasiness, and sadness.
Here is my annotation of the given stanza:

And lonely as it is that loneliness [Sadness]
Will be more lonely ere it will be less-- [Sadness]
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow [Uneasiness]
With no expression, nothing to express. [Uneasiness]

My reasoning for each line is as follows:

* The first line evokes sadness, as the speaker describes loneliness in a way that feels melancholic and isolating.
* The second line continues to evoke sadness, as the speaker suggests that the loneliness will only increase, implying a sense of despair.
* The third line makes me feel uneasy, as the image of a "blanker whiteness of benighted snow" is unsettling and devoid of any warmth or comfort.
* The fourth line continues to evoke uneasiness, as the lack of expression or emotion is unsettling and feels empty.

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces [Vitality]
Between stars--on stars where no human race is. [Vitality]
I have it in me so much nearer home [Beauty/Joy]
To scare myself with my own desert places. [Uneasiness]

My reasoning for each line is as follows:

* The first line evokes a sense of vitality, as the speaker seems confident and unafraid, with a sense of inner strength.
* The second line continues to evoke vitality, as the speaker's tone remains assertive and self-assured.
* The third line makes me feel a sense of beauty/joy, as the phrase "nearer home" suggests a sense of comfort and familiarity.
