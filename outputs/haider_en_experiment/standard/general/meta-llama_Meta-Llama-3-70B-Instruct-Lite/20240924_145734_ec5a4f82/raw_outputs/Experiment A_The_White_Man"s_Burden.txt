* Choose at least one label per line.
* You can use up to two labels per line.

**Gold Standard:**

The guide provides examples for each label, serving as an orientation for annotators. These examples can be used as a reference when in doubt.

**Annotation Task:**

The annotators are asked to annotate the provided stanza:

"TAKE up the White Man"s burden -
Send forth the best ye breed -
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives" need;
To wait in heavy harness
On fluttered folk and wild -
Your new-caught sullen peoples,
Half devil and half child.
Take up the White Man"s burden -
In patience to abide
To veil the threat of terror
And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple,
An hundred times made plain,
To seek another"s profit,
And work another"s gain."
