This is a comprehensive guide for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. It provides clear instructions and examples for annotators to label their subjective emotions while reading poems. Here's a breakdown of the guide:

**Labels and Categories**

The guide provides 9 labels for annotating aesthetic emotions, each with its own category and items to help annotators identify the corresponding emotion:

1. Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful)
4. Humor (found it funny/ amusing)
5. Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic)
6. Sadness (makes me sad/touches me)

8. Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

**Instructions for Annotating**

The guide provides clear instructions for annotators:

* Annotate each line individually, not by sentence.
* Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
* Use as few emotions as possible.
* Choose at least one label per line, but no more than two.
* Choose the dominant emotion while reading the stanza, and add another emotion if necessary.
* Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.

**Gold Standard Examples**

The guide provides examples for each label, serving as an orientation for annotators. These examples help illustrate how to apply the labels in practice.
