**Explanation:**

The entire stanza evokes a strong sense of **Uneasiness**. It depicts the triumph of chaos over order, reason, and even faith. The imagery of fading stars, extinguished lights, and retreating truths creates a pervasive feeling of dread and despair.  

The **Suspense** element is present in the anticipation of chaos's arrival and the sense of inevitability surrounding its dominion.
