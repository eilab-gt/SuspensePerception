Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless; [Sadness]
That only men incredulous of despair, [Sadness]
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air [Sadness]
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access [Awe/Sublime]
Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness, [Sadness]
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare [Sadness]
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare [Uneasiness]
Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express [Sadness]
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death— [Sadness]
Most like a monumental statue set [Sadness]
In everlasting watch and moveless woe [Sadness]
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath. [Sadness]
Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet: [Sadness]
If it could weep, it could arise and go. [Vitality]

My annotations are based on the emotions evoked by each line. I've used the following labels:

* Sadness: The majority of the lines evoke feelings of sadness, grief, and despair.
* Awe/Sublime: The line "Beat upward to God's throne in loud access" suggests a sense of awe and sublimity.
* Uneasiness: The image of "blanching, vertical eye-glare" creates a sense of discomfort and uneasiness.
* Vitality: The final line "If it could weep, it could arise and go" suggests a sense of vitality and potential for change.

Note that I've used the dominant emotion for each line, and in some cases, added a secondary emotion to capture the complexity of the emotional response.
