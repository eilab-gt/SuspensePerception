Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza with the corresponding aesthetic emotions:

When my love swears that she is made of truth , [Beauty/Joy]
I do believe her , though I know she lies , [Humor]
That she might think me some untutor "d youth , [Beauty/Joy]
Unskilful in the world "s false forgeries , [Uneasiness]
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young , [Humor]
Although I know my years be past the best , [Sadness]
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue , [Beauty/Joy]
Outfacing faults in love with love "s ill rest . [Vitality]
But wherefore says my love that she is young ? [Suspense]
And wherefore say not I that I am old ? [Sadness]
O , love "s best habit is a soothing tongue , [Beauty/Joy]
And age , in love , loves not to have years told . [Vitality]
Therefore , I "ll lie with love , and love with me , [Beauty/Joy]
Since that our faults in love thus smother "d be . [Vitality]
