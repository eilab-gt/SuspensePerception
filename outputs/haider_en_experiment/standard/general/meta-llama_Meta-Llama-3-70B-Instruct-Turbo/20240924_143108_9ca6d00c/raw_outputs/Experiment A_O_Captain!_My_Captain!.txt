Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza as follows:

O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, [Sadness]
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, [Beauty/Joy]
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, [Beauty/Joy]
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; [Awe/Sublime]
But O heart! heart! heart! [Sadness]
O the bleeding drops of red, [Sadness]
Where on the deck my Captain lies, [Sadness]
Fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Line 1: The tone is one of sadness and mourning, so I chose the label "Sadness".
* Line 2: The phrase "the prize we sought is won" suggests a sense of accomplishment and joy, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy".
* Line 3: The image of the port being near and the people exulting creates a sense of celebration and happiness, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy".
* Line 4: The description of the vessel as "grim and daring" creates a sense of awe and admiration, so I chose the label "Awe/Sublime".
* Lines 5-8: The repetition of "O heart!" and the description of the Captain's death creates a sense of sadness and mourning, so I chose the label "Sadness" for each of these lines.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; [Vitality]
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, [Vitality]
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, [Beauty/Joy]
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; [Beauty/Joy]
Here Captain! dear father! [Sadness]
This arm beneath your head! [Sadness]
It is some dream that on the deck, [Sadness]
You’ve fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]

From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; [Vitality]
Exult O shores, and ring O bells! [Beauty/Joy]

Walk the deck my Captain lies, [Sadness]
Fallen cold and dead. [Sadness]
