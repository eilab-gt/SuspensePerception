Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Break, break, break, [Sadness]
On thy cold gray stones, O Sea! [Sadness]
And I would that my tongue could utter [Sadness]
The thoughts that arise in me. [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the tone of the stanza is melancholic and introspective, with the speaker expressing a sense of longing and frustration. The repetition of "break" creates a sense of urgency and despair, and the image of the cold gray stones evokes a feeling of desolation. The speaker's desire to express their thoughts but being unable to do so adds to the sense of sadness and frustration. Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is sadness.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

O well for the fisherman's boy, [Beauty/Joy]
That he shouts with his sister at play! [Beauty/Joy]
O well for the sailor lad, [Beauty/Joy]
That he sings in his boat on the bay! [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning is that the tone of the stanza is joyful and celebratory, with a sense of carefree innocence. The image of the fisherman's boy shouting with his sister at play and the sailor lad singing in his boat evokes a feeling of happiness and joy. The use of the phrase "O well for" suggests a sense of contentment and satisfaction, which adds to the overall feeling of beauty and joy.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

And the stately ships go on [Beauty/Joy]
To their haven under the hill; [Beauty/Joy]
But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
And the sound of a voice that is still! [Nostalgia] [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the first two lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, with the image of stately ships sailing to their haven creating a sense of peacefulness and serenity. However, the third and fourth lines take a nostalgic and sad turn, with the speaker longing for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still, suggesting a sense of loss and yearning. The nostalgia label is used in addition to sadness, as the speaker is nostalgic for a past time or person that is no longer present.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Break , break , break , [Sadness]
At the foot of thy crags , O Sea ! [Beauty/Joy]
But the tender grace of a day that is dead [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
Will never come back to me . [Nostalgia] [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the first line evokes a sense of sadness and despair, with the repetition of "break" creating a sense of urgency and desperation. The second line, however, takes a more beautiful and joyful tone, with the image of the sea and its crags evoking a sense of awe and wonder. The third and fourth lines take a nostalgic and sad turn, with the speaker longing for a day that is dead and will never come back, suggesting a sense of loss and yearning. The nostalgia label is used in addition to sadness, as the speaker is nostalgic for a past time or experience that is no longer present.
