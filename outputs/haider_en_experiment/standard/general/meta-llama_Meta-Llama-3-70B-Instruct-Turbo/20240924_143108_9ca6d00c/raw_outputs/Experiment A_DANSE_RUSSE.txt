Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

If I when my wife is sleeping [Beauty/Joy]
and the baby and Kathleen [Beauty/Joy]
are sleeping
and the sun is a flame-white disc [Beauty/Joy]
in silken mists above shining trees ,— [Beauty/Joy]
if I in my north room [Humor]
danse naked , grotesquely [Humor]
before my mirror
waving my shirt round my head [Humor]
and singing softly to myself : [Humor]
“I am lonely, lonely. [Sadness]
I was born to be lonely . [Sadness]
I am best so !” [Sadness]
If I admire my arms , my face, [Vitality]
my shoulders , flanks , buttocks [Vitality]
against the yellow drawn shades ,— [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of peace and serenity, so I chose Beauty/Joy.
* The next four lines have a playful and humorous tone, so I chose Humor.
* The following three lines express a sense of loneliness and sadness, so I chose Sadness.
* The final three lines have an empowering and confident tone, so I chose Vitality.

Note that I've tried to follow the guidelines and use as few emotions as possible, choosing the dominant emotion for each section of the stanza.
Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

who shall say I am not [Humor]
the happy genius of my household ? [Humor]

Here's my reasoning:

* The tone of the stanza is playful and tongue-in-cheek, with a sense of irony and self-deprecation. The use of the phrase "happy genius" is particularly humorous, as it's an exaggerated and unlikely claim.
* The overall feeling evoked by the stanza is one of amusement and lightheartedness, which corresponds to the Humor label.

Note that I've chosen a single label for the entire stanza, as the tone and emotion are consistent throughout.
