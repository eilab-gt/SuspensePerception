Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, [Sadness]
Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year! [Sadness]
My hasting days fly on with full career, [Vitality]
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th. [Sadness]
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, [Annoyance]
That I to manhood am arrived so near, [Vitality]
And inward ripeness doth much less appear, [Sadness]
That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th. [Envy/Annoyance]
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, [Vitality]
It shall be still in strictest measure even [Awe/Sublime]
To that same lot, however mean or high, [Awe/Sublime]
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven, [Awe/Sublime]
All is, if I have grace to use it so, [Vitality]
As ever in my great Task-master’s eye [Awe/Sublime]
