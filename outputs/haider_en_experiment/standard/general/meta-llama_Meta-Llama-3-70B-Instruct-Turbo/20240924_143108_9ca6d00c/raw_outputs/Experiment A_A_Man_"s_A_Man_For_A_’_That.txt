Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

Is there for honest Poverty [Beauty/Joy]
That hings his head , an ’ a ’ that ; [Beauty/Joy]
The coward slave — we pass him by , [Annoyance]
We dare be poor for a ’ that ! [Vitality]
For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that . [Vitality]
Our toils obscure an ’ a ’ that , [Sadness]
The rank is but the guinea "s stamp , [Annoyance]
The Man "s the gowd for a ’ that . [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Lines 1-2: The language used is poetic and evocative, conveying a sense of pride and dignity in poverty, which evokes feelings of beauty and joy.
* Line 3: The phrase "coward slave" has a negative connotation, which triggers feelings of annoyance.
* Line 4: The phrase "We dare be poor for a ' that !" suggests a sense of defiance and courage, which inspires vitality.
* Line 5: The repetition of "For a ' that , an ' a ' that" reinforces the sense of vitality and determination.
* Line 6: The phrase "Our toils obscure an ' a ' that" suggests a sense of hardship and struggle, which evokes feelings of sadness.
* Line 7: The phrase "The rank is but the guinea 's stamp" has a negative connotation, implying that social status is only valued for its material worth, which triggers feelings of annoyance.
* Line 8: The final line "The Man 's the gowd for a ' that" returns to the theme of dignity and worth, evoking feelings of beauty and joy.

Note that I've used a mix of emotions to annotate this stanza, as the poem seems to be exploring the complexities of poverty and dignity.
Here is the annotated stanza:

What though on hamely fare we dine , [Beauty/Joy]
Wear hoddin grey , an ’ a that ; [Beauty/Joy]
Gie fools their silks , and knaves their wine ; [Annoyance]
A Man "s a Man for a ’ that : [Vitality]
For a ’ that , and a ’ that , [Vitality]
Their tinsel show , an ’ a ’ that ; [Annoyance]
The honest man , tho ’ e"er sae poor , [Beauty/Joy]
Is king o ’ men for a ’ that . [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Lines 1-2: The language used is simple and humble, conveying a sense of contentment and appreciation for simple things, which evokes feelings of beauty and joy.
* Line 3: The phrase "Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine" has a negative connotation, implying that those who are foolish or deceitful are being indulged, which triggers feelings of annoyance.
* Line 4: The phrase "A Man's a Man for a' that" suggests a sense of dignity and self-worth, which inspires vitality.
* Line 5: The repetition of "For a' that, and a' that" reinforces the sense of vitality and determination.
* Line 6: The phrase "Their tinsel show, an' a' that" has a negative connotation, implying that superficial displays of wealth or status are empty and unimportant, which triggers feelings of annoyance.
* Line 7: The phrase "The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor" suggests a sense of integrity and moral character, which evokes feelings of beauty and joy.
* Line 8: The final line "Is king o' men for a' that" reinforces the sense of vitality and dignity, implying that true greatness comes from inner character rather than external circumstances.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Ye see yon birkie , ca "d a lord , [Annoyance]
Wha struts , an ’ stares , an ’ a ’ that ; [Annoyance]
Tho ’ hundreds worship at his word , [Sadness]
He "s but a coof for a ’ that : [Annoyance]
For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that , [Annoyance]
His ribband , star , an ’ a ’ that : [Annoyance]
The man o ’ independent mind [Vitality]
He looks an ’ laughs at a ’ that . [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Lines 1-2: The description of the "birkie" as someone who struts and stares, implying arrogance and self-importance, triggers feelings of annoyance.
* Line 3: The fact that hundreds worship at his word, despite his lack of true value, evokes feelings of sadness.
* Lines 4-6: The repetition of "a' that" and the description of the birkie's superficial trappings (ribband, star) reinforces the sense of annoyance and frustration.
* Lines 7-8: The contrast with the "man o' independent mind" who looks and laughs at the birkie's pretensions inspires feelings of vitality and admiration for someone who is not swayed by superficiality.
Here is the annotated stanza:

A prince can mak a belted knight , [Annoyance]
A marquis , duke , an ’ a ’ that ; [Annoyance]
But an honest man "s abon his might , [Vitality]
Gude faith , he maunna fa ’ that ! [Vitality]
For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that , [Annoyance]
Their dignities an ’ a ’ that ; [Annoyance]
The pith o ’ sense , an ’ pride o ’ worth , [Vitality]
Are higher rank than a ’ that . [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Lines 1-2: The description of a prince's ability to confer titles and ranks triggers feelings of annoyance, as it implies a sense of superficiality and arbitrary power.
* Line 3: The phrase "an honest man's abon his might" suggests a sense of self-worth and integrity, which inspires feelings of vitality and admiration.
* Line 4: The exclamation "Gude faith, he maunna fa' that!" reinforces the sense of vitality and confidence in one's own abilities.
* Lines 5-6: The repetition of "a' that" and the emphasis on dignities and ranks triggers feelings of annoyance again, as it seems to prioritize superficial status over true worth.
* Lines 7-8: The phrase "The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth" suggests a sense of inner strength and self-respect, which inspires feelings of vitality and admiration. The final line "Are higher rank than a' that" reinforces this sense of true value and worth.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Then let us pray that come it may , [Vitality]
( As come it will for a ’ that ,) [Vitality]
That Sense and Worth , o"er a ’ the earth , [Vitality]

For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that , [Vitality]
It "s coming yet for a ’ that , [Vitality]
That Man to Man , the world o"er , [Vitality]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* The entire stanza has a sense of optimism and hope, which inspires feelings of vitality and enthusiasm. The language used is uplifting and encouraging, with phrases like "let us pray", "Sense and Worth", "brothers be", which evoke a sense of unity and togetherness.
* The repetition of "for a' that" becomes a refrain, emphasizing the idea that a better future is coming, and that it will be a time of equality and brotherhood.
* There is no sense of negativity, sadness, or unease in this stanza, which is why I have not annotated any of those emotions. The overall tone is one of hope and inspiration, which aligns with the label of Vitality.
