Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast [Beauty/Joy]
In a field I looked into going past, [Beauty/Joy]
And the ground almost covered smooth in snow, [Beauty/Joy]
But a few weeds and stubble showing last. [Beauty/Joy]

My reasoning is that the imagery in the stanza creates a peaceful and serene atmosphere, evoking feelings of beauty and joy. The use of words like "snow", "night", "smooth", and "past" creates a sense of calmness and tranquility, which matches the label "Beauty/Joy".
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

The woods around it have it--it is theirs. [Sadness]
All animals are smothered in their lairs. [Sadness]
I am too absent-spirited to count; [Sadness]
The loneliness includes me unawares. [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the imagery in the stanza creates a sense of desolation and isolation, evoking feelings of sadness. The use of words like "smothered", "absent-spirited", and "loneliness" creates a somber and melancholic atmosphere, which matches the label "Sadness".
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

And lonely as it is that loneliness [Sadness]
Will be more lonely ere it will be less--[Sadness]
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow [Sadness]
With no expression, nothing to express. [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the imagery in the stanza creates a sense of desolation, isolation, and emptiness, evoking feelings of sadness. The use of words like "lonely", "blanker", "benighted", and "nothing to express" creates a somber and melancholic atmosphere, which matches the label "Sadness".
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces [Uneasiness]
Between stars--on stars where no human race is. [Uneasiness]
I have it in me so much nearer home [Sadness]
To scare myself with my own desert places. [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the first two lines create a sense of uneasiness and discomfort, evoking feelings of eeriness and desolation. The use of words like "empty spaces" and "no human race is" creates a sense of isolation and abandonment, which matches the label "Uneasiness".

The last two lines, however, shift the focus to the speaker's inner world, and the tone becomes more introspective and melancholic. The use of words like "desert places" and "scare myself" creates a sense of sadness and self-reflection, which matches the label "Sadness".
