I'll annotate the stanza according to the guidelines provided:

My love is like to ice, and I to fire: [Beauty/Joy]
How comes it then that this her cold so great [Beauty/Joy]
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire, [Beauty/Joy]
But harder grows the more I her entreat? [Beauty/Joy]
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat [Beauty/Joy]
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold, [Beauty/Joy]
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat, [Beauty/Joy]
And feel my flames augmented manifold? [Beauty/Joy]
What more miraculous thing may be told, [Awe/Sublime]
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice, [Awe/Sublime]
And ice, which is congeal's with senseless cold, [Awe/Sublime]
Should kindle fire by wonderful device? [Awe/Sublime]
Such is the power of love in gentle mind, [Beauty/Joy]
That it can alter all the course of kind. [Beauty/Joy]

I chose the labels based on the emotions evoked by each line. The dominant emotion is Beauty/Joy, with a sense of wonder and admiration for the power of love. The lines that evoke Awe/Sublime are those that describe the miraculous and wonderful aspects of love.
