Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza as follows:

They shut the road through the woods [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
Seventy years ago. [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
Weather and rain have undone it again, [Sadness]
And now you would never know [Sadness]
There was once a road through the woods [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
Before they planted the trees. [Sadness] [Nostalgia]
It is underneath the coppice and heath, [Beauty/Joy]
And the thin anemones. [Beauty/Joy]
Only the keeper sees [Suspense]
That, where the ring-dove broods, [Beauty/Joy]
And the badgers roll at ease, [Beauty/Joy]
There was once a road through the woods. [Sadness] [Nostalgia]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first two lines evoke a sense of sadness and nostalgia, as the speaker is reminiscing about a road that was shut down 70 years ago.
* The third and fourth lines continue to convey sadness, as the speaker notes that the road has been undone, and it's now impossible to know it existed.
* The fifth and sixth lines again evoke sadness and nostalgia, as the speaker remembers the road's existence before the trees were planted.
* The seventh and eighth lines introduce a sense of beauty and joy, as the speaker describes the natural scenery underneath the coppice and heath.
* The ninth line creates a sense of suspense, as the speaker notes that only the keeper sees the remnants of the road.
* The tenth and eleventh lines return to a sense of beauty and joy, as the speaker describes the ring-dove and badgers in their natural habitat.
* The final line returns to sadness and nostalgia, as the speaker repeats the phrase "There was once a road through the woods."
Here is the annotated stanza:

Yet, if you enter the woods [Beauty/Joy]
Of a summer evening late, [Beauty/Joy]
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools [Beauty/Joy]
Where the otter whistles his mate, [Beauty/Joy]
(They fear not men in the woods, [Suspense]
Because they see so few.) [Suspense]
You will hear the beat of a horseâ€™s feet, [Suspense]
And the swish of a skirt in the dew, [Suspense]
Steadily cantering through [Suspense]
The misty solitudes, [Beauty/Joy]
As though they perfectly knew [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
The old lost road through the woods. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
But there is no road through the woods. [Sadness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, as the speaker describes a peaceful summer evening in the woods.
* The fifth and sixth lines introduce a sense of suspense, as the speaker notes that the animals in the woods are not afraid of humans because they rarely see them.
* The seventh to ninth lines continue to create suspense, as the speaker describes the sound of a horse's feet and a skirt in the dew, suggesting that someone or something is approaching.
* The tenth line returns to a sense of beauty and joy, as the speaker describes the misty solitudes.
* The eleventh line evokes a sense of nostalgia, as the speaker notes that the horse and rider seem to know the old lost road through the woods.
* The twelfth line is a sad revelation, as the speaker notes that there is no road through the woods, implying that the horse and rider are lost or mistaken.
