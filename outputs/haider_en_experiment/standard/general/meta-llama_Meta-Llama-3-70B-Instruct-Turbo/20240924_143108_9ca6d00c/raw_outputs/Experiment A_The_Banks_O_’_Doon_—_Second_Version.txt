Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the provided stanza:

Ye flowery banks o' bonie Doon, [Beauty/Joy]
How can ye blume sae fair? [Beauty/Joy]
How can ye chant, ye little birds, [Beauty/Joy]
And I sae fu' o care! [Sadness]

Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, [Sadness]
That sings upon the bough! [Sadness]
Thou minds me o' the happy days [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
When my fause Luve was true. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]

Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird, [Sadness]
That sings beside thy mate; [Sadness]
For sae I sat, and sae I sang, [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
And wist na o' my fate. [Sadness]

Here's a breakdown of my annotation:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, with the description of the flowery banks and the birds singing.
* The fifth line introduces a sense of sadness, as the speaker's heart is about to be broken.
* The sixth and seventh lines continue the sadness, with the speaker reminiscing about happy days in the past, which is also nostalgic.
* The eighth and ninth lines repeat the sadness, with the speaker's heart being broken again, and the nostalgia continues with the memory of singing and being unaware of their fate.

Note that I've used a combination of labels, as instructed, to capture the complex emotions evoked by the poem.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon, [Beauty/Joy]
To see the woodbine twine; [Beauty/Joy]
And ilka bird sang o' its Luve, [Beauty/Joy]
And sae did I o' mine. [Beauty/Joy]

Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose, [Beauty/Joy]
Upon its thorny tree; [Beauty/Joy]
But my fause Luver staw my rose, [Sadness]
And left the thorn wi' me. [Sadness]

Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose, [Beauty/Joy]
Upon a morn in June; [Beauty/Joy]
Wi' lightsome heart I flourished on the morn, [Beauty/Joy]
And sae was pu'd or noon. [Nostalgia] [Sadness]
