Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

AT ten A.M. the young housewife
moves about in negligee behind
the wooden walls of her husband"s house.
[Beauty/Joy] (The image of the young housewife in her negligee creates a sense of intimacy and beauty)

I pass solitary in my car.
[Suspense] (The sudden introduction of the speaker's presence creates a sense of intrigue)

Then again she comes to the curb
to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
shy, uncorseted, tucking in
stray ends of hair, and I compare her
to a fallen leaf.
[Beauty/Joy] [Nostalgia] (The description of the housewife's actions and the comparison to a fallen leaf evoke a sense of beauty and nostalgia)

The noiseless wheels of my car
rush with a crackling sound over
dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling.
[Suspense] [Vitality] (The sudden movement of the car and the sound of the leaves create a sense of suspense, while the speaker's bowing and smiling suggest a sense of vitality)

Note: I've chosen the labels based on the emotions evoked by the imagery and language used in the stanza. The dominant emotion in each line is listed first, and additional emotions are listed second if applicable.
