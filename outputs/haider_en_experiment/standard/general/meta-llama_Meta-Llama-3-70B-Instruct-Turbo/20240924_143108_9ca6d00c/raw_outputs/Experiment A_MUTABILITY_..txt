Based on the guidelines and examples provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

The flower that smiles to-day [Beauty/Joy]
To-morrow dies ; [Sadness]
All that we wish to stay [Sadness]
Tempts and then flies . [Sadness]
What is this world "s delight ? [Suspense]
Lightning that mocks the night , [Awe/Sublime]
Brief even as bright . [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* "The flower that smiles to-day" evokes a sense of beauty and joy, so it's labeled as [Beauty/Joy].
* "To-morrow dies ;" is a sad and melancholic statement, so it's labeled as [Sadness].
* "All that we wish to stay" and "Tempts and then flies ." both convey a sense of longing and loss, so they're labeled as [Sadness].
* "What is this world "s delight ?" is a question that sparks curiosity and interest, so it's labeled as [Suspense].
* "Lightning that mocks the night ," is a powerful and awe-inspiring image, so it's labeled as [Awe/Sublime].
* "Brief even as bright ." is a bittersweet statement that acknowledges the fleeting nature of beauty, so it's labeled as [Beauty/Joy].
