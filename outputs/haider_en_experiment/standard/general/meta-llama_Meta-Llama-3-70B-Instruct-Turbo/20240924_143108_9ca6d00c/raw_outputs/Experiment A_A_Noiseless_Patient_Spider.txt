Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

A noiseless patient spider , [Awe/Sublime]
I mark "d where on a little promontory it stood isolated , [Awe/Sublime]
Mark "d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding , [Awe/Sublime]
It launch "d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself , [Awe/Sublime]
Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them . [Awe/Sublime]

The dominant emotion I feel while reading this stanza is a sense of awe and wonder at the spider's ability to explore and create its web. The use of words like "noiseless", "patient", and "vacant" creates a sense of quiet contemplation, and the image of the spider launching forth filaments is both fascinating and beautiful. The overall tone of the stanza is one of calm and serene wonder, which is why I have chosen the label Awe/Sublime for each line.
Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

And you O my soul where you stand , [Awe/Sublime]
Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space , [Awe/Sublime]
Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to [Awe/Sublime]
connect them , [Awe/Sublime]
Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold , [Vitality]
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul . [Vitality]

The dominant emotion I feel while reading this stanza is a sense of awe and wonder at the vastness of space and the soul's journey to connect with it. The use of words like "measureless oceans of space" and "ceaselessly musing" creates a sense of grandeur and contemplation. The image of the soul venturing and seeking to connect the spheres is both beautiful and inspiring, which is why I have chosen the label Awe/Sublime for the first four lines.

The last two lines, however, shift the focus to the idea of the soul finding its anchor and connection, which evokes a sense of vitality and inspiration. The use of words like "ductile anchor hold" and "gossamer thread" creates a sense of movement and energy, which is why I have chosen the label Vitality for these lines.
