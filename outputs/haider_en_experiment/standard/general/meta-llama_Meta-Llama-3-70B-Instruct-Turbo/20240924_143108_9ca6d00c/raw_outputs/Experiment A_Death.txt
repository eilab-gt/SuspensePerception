Based on the guidelines provided, I will label the emotions in the given stanza:

Nor dread nor hope attend [Sadness]
A dying animal; [Sadness]
A man awaits his end [Sadness]
Dreading and hoping all; [Sadness]
Many times he died, [Sadness]
Many times rose again, [Vitality]
A great man in his pride [Vitality]
Confronting murderous men [Uneasiness]
Casts derision upon [Annoyance]
Supersession of breath; [Sadness]
He knows death to the bone â€“ [Sadness]
Man has created death. [Awe/Sublime]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Lines 1-5: The theme of death and the emotional tone of the lines evoke feelings of sadness.
* Line 6: The phrase "Many times rose again" suggests a sense of vitality and resilience, which contrasts with the previous lines.
* Line 7: The phrase "A great man in his pride" continues the theme of vitality and strength.
* Line 8: The phrase "Confronting murderous men" creates a sense of uneasiness and tension.
* Line 9: The phrase "Casts derision upon" suggests annoyance and frustration.
* Lines 10-11: The theme of death and mortality returns, evoking feelings of sadness and awe/sublime. The phrase "Man has created death" is particularly striking and evocative, suggesting a sense of awe and wonder at the human capacity for destruction.
