Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza with the corresponding aesthetic emotions:

Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art— [Awe/Sublime]
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night [Awe/Sublime]
And watching, with eternal lids apart, [Awe/Sublime]
Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite, [Awe/Sublime]
The moving waters at their priestlike task [Awe/Sublime]
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores, [Awe/Sublime]
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask [Awe/Sublime]
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors— [Awe/Sublime]
No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable, [Beauty/Joy]
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast, [Beauty/Joy]
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, [Beauty/Joy]
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, [Beauty/Joy]
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, [Beauty/Joy]
And so live ever—or else swoon to death. [Sadness]

My annotation is based on the following reasoning:

* The first eight lines evoke a sense of awe and sublimity, as the speaker describes the star's steadfastness and the natural world's beauty. The language used is grand and majestic, inspiring feelings of wonder and admiration.
* The next four lines shift to a more personal and intimate tone, describing the speaker's desire to be with their loved one. The language is sensual and romantic, evoking feelings of joy and beauty.
* The final line introduces a note of sadness and longing, as the speaker contemplates the possibility of death if they cannot be with their loved one. This line adds a sense of melancholy to the overall tone of the poem.
