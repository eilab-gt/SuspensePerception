Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens , [Uneasiness]
And along the trampled edges of the street [Uneasiness]
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids [Sadness]
Sprouting despondently at area gates . [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line creates a sense of uneasiness due to the noise and chaos of the breakfast plates, which evokes a feeling of discomfort.
* The second line continues to create a sense of uneasiness with the description of the "trampled edges of the street", which implies a sense of neglect and disorder.
* The third line evokes a sense of sadness with the description of the "damp souls of housemaids", which implies a sense of despair and hopelessness.
* The fourth line continues to evoke a sense of sadness with the description of the housemaids "sprouting despondently", which reinforces the idea of despair and hopelessness.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is uneasiness, with a secondary emotion of sadness.
Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

The brown waves of fog toss up to me [Uneasiness]
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street , [Uneasiness]
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts [Uneasiness]
An aimless smile that hovers in the air [Sadness]
And vanishes along the level of the roofs . [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line creates a sense of uneasiness with the description of the "brown waves of fog" and "twisted faces", which evokes a feeling of discomfort and eeriness.
* The second line continues to create a sense of uneasiness with the description of the "twisted faces from the bottom of the street", which reinforces the feeling of discomfort and unease.
* The third line also creates a sense of uneasiness with the description of the "muddy skirts", which adds to the overall feeling of discomfort and disorder.
* The fourth line shifts to a sense of sadness with the description of the "aimless smile that hovers in the air", which evokes a feeling of melancholy and despair.
* The fifth line continues to evoke a sense of sadness with the description of the smile "vanishing along the level of the roofs", which reinforces the feeling of melancholy and loss.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is uneasiness, with a secondary emotion of sadness.
