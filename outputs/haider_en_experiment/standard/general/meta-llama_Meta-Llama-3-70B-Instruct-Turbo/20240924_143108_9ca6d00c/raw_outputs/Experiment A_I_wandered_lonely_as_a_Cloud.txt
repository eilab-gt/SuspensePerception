Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

I wandered lonely as a Cloud [Sadness]
That floats on high over Vales and Hills , [Beauty/Joy]
When all at once I saw a crowd [Suspense]
A host of dancing Daffodills ; [Beauty/Joy]
Along the Lake , beneath the trees , [Beauty/Joy]
Ten thousand dancing in the breeze . [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "I wandered lonely as a Cloud" evokes a sense of sadness and isolation, so I chose the label "Sadness".
* The second line "That floats on high over Vales and Hills" creates a sense of beauty and wonder, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy".
* The third line "When all at once I saw a crowd" creates a sense of surprise and curiosity, so I chose the label "Suspense".
* The fourth and fifth lines "A host of dancing Daffodills ; / Along the Lake , beneath the trees" continue to evoke a sense of beauty and joy, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" again.
* The final line "Ten thousand dancing in the breeze" reinforces the sense of beauty and joy, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" once more.

Note that I've chosen to use the label "Beauty/Joy" multiple times, as the poem's imagery and language evoke a strong sense of beauty and wonder throughout the stanza.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Continuous as the stars that shine [Beauty/Joy]
And twinkle on the milky way, [Beauty/Joy]
They stretched in never-ending line [Beauty/Joy]
Along the margin of a bay: [Beauty/Joy]
Ten thousand saw I at a glance, [Suspense]
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first four lines create a sense of beauty and wonder, evoking a sense of awe at the vastness and beauty of the natural world. I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" for each of these lines.
* The fifth line "Ten thousand saw I at a glance" creates a sense of surprise and curiosity, so I chose the label "Suspense".
* The final line "Tossing their heads in sprightly dance" returns to the theme of beauty and joy, so I chose the label "Beauty/Joy" again.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is "Beauty/Joy", with a brief moment of "Suspense" in the fifth line.
Here is the annotated stanza:

The waves beside them danced , but they [Beauty/Joy]
Outdid the sparkling waves in glee :— [Beauty/Joy]

In vacant or in pensive mood , [Sadness]
