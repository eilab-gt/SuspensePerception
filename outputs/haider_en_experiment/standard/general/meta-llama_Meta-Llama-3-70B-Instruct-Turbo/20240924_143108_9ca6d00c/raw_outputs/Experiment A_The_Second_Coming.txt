Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

Turning and turning in the widening gyre [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
The falcon cannot hear the falconer; [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
The ceremony of innocence is drowned; [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
The best lack all conviction, while the worst [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Are full of passionate intensity. [Uneasiness] [Suspense]

My annotation is based on the following reasoning:

* The overall tone of the stanza is one of chaos and disorder, which evokes feelings of uneasiness and suspense.
* The imagery of things falling apart, anarchy, and blood-dimmed tides creates a sense of discomfort and tension.
* The line "The ceremony of innocence is drowned" adds a sense of sadness to the overall uneasiness.
* The contrast between the best lacking conviction and the worst being full of passionate intensity adds to the sense of uneasiness and suspense.

Note that I have chosen to use multiple labels for some lines, as the guidelines allow for up to two labels per line.
Here is the annotated stanza:

Surely some revelation is at hand; [Suspense]
Surely the Second Coming is at hand. [Suspense]
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
A shape with lion body and the head of a man, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
The darkness drops again; but now I know [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
That twenty centuries of stony sleep [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? [Uneasiness] [Suspense]

My annotation is based on the following reasoning:

* The overall tone of the stanza is one of foreboding and unease, which evokes feelings of suspense and uneasiness.
* The imagery of the Second Coming and the vast image out of Spiritus Mundi creates a sense of discomfort and tension.
* The use of words like "troubles", "blank", "pitiless", and "indignant" adds to the sense of uneasiness and suspense.
* The lines "The darkness drops again; but now I know / That twenty centuries of stony sleep" introduce a sense of sadness and melancholy.
* The final lines "And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?" maintain the sense of uneasiness and suspense, with a hint of foreboding.
