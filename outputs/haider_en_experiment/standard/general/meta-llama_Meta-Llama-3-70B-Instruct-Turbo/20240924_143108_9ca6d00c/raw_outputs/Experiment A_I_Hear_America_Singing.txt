Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the provided stanza:

I hear America singing , the varied carols I hear , [Beauty/Joy]
Those of mechanics , each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong , [Beauty/Joy]
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam , [Beauty/Joy]
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work , [Beauty/Joy]
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat , the deckhand [Beauty/Joy]
singing on the steamboat deck , [Beauty/Joy]
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench , the hatter singing as [Beauty/Joy]
he stands , [Beauty/Joy]
The wood-cutter "s song , the ploughboy "s on his way in the morning , [Beauty/Joy]
or at noon intermission or at sundown , [Beauty/Joy]
The delicious singing of the mother , or of the young wife at work , [Beauty/Joy]
or of the girl sewing or washing , [Beauty/Joy]
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else , [Beauty/Joy]
The day what belongs to the day â€” at night the party of young [Vitality]
fellows , robust , friendly , [Vitality]
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs . [Vitality]

My annotations are based on the emotions I experience while reading the stanza. The dominant emotion is Beauty/Joy, as the poem describes a vivid and harmonious scene of people singing and working together, evoking feelings of happiness and pleasure. The last three lines, however, shift to a more energetic and lively tone, which I annotate as Vitality, as they convey a sense of movement and energy.
