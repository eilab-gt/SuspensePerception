Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

THERE was never a sound beside the wood but one , [Beauty/Joy]
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground . [Beauty/Joy]
What was it it whispered ? I knew not well myself ; [Suspense]
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun , [Beauty/Joy]
Something , perhaps , about the lack of sound â€” [Suspense]
And that was why it whispered and did not speak . [Beauty/Joy]
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours , [Sadness]
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf : [Sadness]
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak [Vitality]
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows , [Vitality]
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers [Beauty/Joy]
( Pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake . [Uneasiness]
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows . [Vitality]
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make . [Beauty/Joy]
