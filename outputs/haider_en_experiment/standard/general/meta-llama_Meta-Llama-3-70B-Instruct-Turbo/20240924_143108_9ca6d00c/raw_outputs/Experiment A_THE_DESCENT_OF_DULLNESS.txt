This is a guideline for annotating aesthetic emotions in poetry. The goal is to achieve agreement among annotators on the subjective emotions evoked by a poem. The guideline provides 9 labels for annotating emotions, each with its own set of items to help annotators identify the corresponding emotion.

**Labels and Items:**

1. **Annoyance**: annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated
2. **Awe/Sublime**: found it overwhelming, sense of greatness
3. **Beauty/Joy**: found it beautiful, pleasing, makes me happy, joyful
4. **Humor**: found it funny, amusing
5. **Nostalgia**: makes me nostalgic (must be used with Beauty/Joy or Sadness)
6. **Sadness**: makes me sad, touches me
7. **Suspense**: found it gripping, sparked my interest
8. **Uneasiness**: found it ugly, unsettling, disturbing, frightening, distasteful
9. **Vitality**: found it invigorating, spurs me on, inspires me

**Instructions for Annotating:**

1. Annotate your current feelings while reading the poem.
2. Label each line individually (not sentence).
3. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
4. Use as few emotions as possible.
5. Choose at least one label per line.
6. You can use up to two labels per line.
7. Choose the dominant emotion and add another emotion if necessary.
8. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
9. If you change the non-dominant emotion, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally.
