Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

Some say the world will end in fire, [Suspense]
Some say in ice. [Suspense]
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire [Annoyance]
I hold with those who favor fire. [Annoyance]
But if it had to perish twice, [Sadness]
I think I know enough of hate [Sadness]
To say that for destruction ice [Sadness]
Is also great [Awe/Sublime]
And would suffice. [Awe/Sublime]

Here's my reasoning:

* Lines 1-2: The uncertainty and contrast between fire and ice create a sense of suspense, keeping the reader engaged and curious.
* Lines 3-4: The mention of desire and favoring fire might evoke feelings of annoyance or frustration, as it implies a strong and potentially destructive passion.
* Lines 5-7: The idea of the world perishing twice and the speaker's knowledge of hate creates a sense of sadness and despair.
* Lines 8-9: The description of ice as "great" and sufficient for destruction inspires a sense of awe or sublimity, as it highlights the power and magnitude of ice as a force of destruction.

Please note that annotation is subjective, and other annotators might interpret the emotions differently.
