Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Half a league , half a league , [Suspense]
Half a league onward , [Suspense]
All in the valley of Death [Awe/Sublime]
Rode the six hundred . [Awe/Sublime]
‘ Forward , the Light Brigade ! ’ [Vitality]
‘ Charge for the guns ! ’ he said : [Vitality]
Into the valley of Death [Awe/Sublime]
Rode the six hundred . [Awe/Sublime]

My reasoning is as follows:

* Lines 1-2: The repetition of "Half a league" creates a sense of anticipation and tension, which is why I chose the label "Suspense".
* Line 3: The phrase "valley of Death" evokes a sense of grandeur and solemnity, which is why I chose the label "Awe/Sublime".
* Line 4: The image of the six hundred riding into the valley of Death is also awe-inspiring, so I chose the same label.
* Lines 5-6: The commands "Forward" and "Charge" convey a sense of energy and urgency, which is why I chose the label "Vitality".
* Lines 7-8: The repetition of the phrase "Into the valley of Death" and "Rode the six hundred" reinforces the sense of awe and grandeur, so I chose the same label again.

Note that I chose only one or two labels per line, as per the instructions, and tried to capture the dominant emotion in each line.
