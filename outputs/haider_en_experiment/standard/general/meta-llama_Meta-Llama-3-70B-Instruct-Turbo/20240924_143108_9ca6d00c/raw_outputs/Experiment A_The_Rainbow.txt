Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza as follows:

My heart leaps up when I behold [Beauty/Joy]
A rainbow in the sky: [Beauty/Joy]
So was it when my life began; [Nostalgia] [Beauty/Joy]
So is it now I am a man; [Beauty/Joy]
So be it when I shall grow old, [Vitality]
Or let me die! [Vitality]
The Child is father of the Man; [Awe/Sublime]
And I could wish my days to be [Beauty/Joy]
Bound each to each by natural piety. [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Lines 1-2: The image of a rainbow in the sky evokes feelings of joy and beauty.
* Line 3: The nostalgia label is added because the line references the past, and the beauty/joy label is maintained because the tone is still positive.
* Line 4: The beauty/joy label continues, as the speaker is reflecting on their current state.
* Line 5: The vitality label is chosen because the line expresses a sense of determination and energy.
* Line 6: The vitality label continues, as the speaker seems to be embracing the idea of mortality.
* Line 7: The awe/sublime label is chosen because the line expresses a profound and philosophical idea.
* Lines 8-9: The beauty/joy label returns, as the speaker expresses a desire for a sense of connection and harmony.
