Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still [Suspense]
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed [Uneasiness]
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, [Uneasiness]
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. [Uneasiness]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line creates a sense of sudden shock and surprise, which sparks my interest and makes me curious about what's happening, hence the label [Suspense].
* The second and third lines create a sense of unease and discomfort, with the image of the girl being caressed by dark webs and her nape caught in the bird's bill. This evokes feelings of disturbance and discomfort, hence the label [Uneasiness].
* The fourth line continues to create a sense of unease and discomfort, with the image of the girl being held helpless against the bird's breast. This reinforces the feeling of disturbance and discomfort, hence the label [Uneasiness] again.

Note that I've chosen to use only two labels, [Suspense] and [Uneasiness], as they seem to capture the dominant emotions evoked by the stanza.
Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

How can those terrified vague fingers push [Uneasiness]
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs? [Uneasiness]
And how can body, laid in that white rush, [Suspense]
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies? [Suspense]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first and second lines create a sense of unease and discomfort, with the image of terrified fingers pushing something from the girl's thighs. This evokes feelings of disturbance and discomfort, hence the label [Uneasiness].
* The third and fourth lines create a sense of suspense and curiosity, with the question of how the body can feel the strange heart beating. This sparks my interest and makes me wonder what's happening, hence the label [Suspense].

Note that I've chosen to use two labels, [Uneasiness] and [Suspense], as they seem to capture the dominant emotions evoked by the stanza.
Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

A shudder in the loins engenders there [Uneasiness]
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower [Uneasiness]
And Agamemnon dead. [Sadness] [Uneasiness]
Being so caught up, [Suspense]
So mastered by the brute blood of the air, [Suspense]
Did she put on his knowledge with his power [Suspense]
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop? [Suspense]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first and second lines create a sense of unease and discomfort, with the image of a shudder in the loins and a broken wall and burning roof. This evokes feelings of disturbance and discomfort, hence the label [Uneasiness].
* The third line adds to the sense of sadness and tragedy, with the death of Agamemnon, hence the label [Sadness] in addition to [Uneasiness].
* The fourth to sixth lines create a sense of suspense and curiosity, with the questions of being caught up and mastered by the brute blood of the air, and the uncertainty of what will happen next. This sparks my interest and makes me wonder what's happening, hence the label [Suspense].

Note that I've chosen to use three labels, [Uneasiness], [Sadness], and [Suspense], as they seem to capture the dominant emotions evoked by the stanza.
