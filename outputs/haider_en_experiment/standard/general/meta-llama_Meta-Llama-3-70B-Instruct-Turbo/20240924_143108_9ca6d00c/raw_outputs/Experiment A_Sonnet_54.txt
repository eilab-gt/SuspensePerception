I'm happy to help you with annotating the given stanza according to the provided guidelines. Here's my annotation:

Of this worlds theatre in which we stay, [Beauty/Joy]
My love like the spectator ydly sits [Beauty/Joy]
Beholding me that all the pageants play, [Beauty/Joy]
Disguysing diversly my troubled wits. [Sadness]

Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits, [Beauty/Joy]
And mask in myrth lyke to a comedy: [Beauty/Joy]
Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits, [Sadness]
I waile and make my woes a tragedy. [Sadness]

Yet she, beholding me with constant eye, [Suspense]
Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart: [Annoyance]
But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cry [Annoyance]
She laughs and hardens evermore her heart. [Annoyance]

What then can move her? if nor merth nor mone, [Suspense]
She is no woman, but a senceless stone. [Uneasiness]

Here's a brief explanation for each line:

* The first four lines evoke a sense of beauty and joy, as the speaker describes their love as a spectator, but also hints at their troubled state of mind, which introduces a sense of sadness.
* The next four lines continue to oscillate between joy and sorrow, with the speaker describing their emotional turmoil.
* The third stanza introduces a sense of suspense, as the speaker's love seems unresponsive to their emotions, and the speaker feels annoyed and frustrated by this.
* The final two lines create a sense of uneasiness, as the speaker questions what can move their love, and concludes that they must be "a senceless stone" - a disturbing and unsettling image.

Please note that annotation is subjective, and different annotators may have different interpretations.
