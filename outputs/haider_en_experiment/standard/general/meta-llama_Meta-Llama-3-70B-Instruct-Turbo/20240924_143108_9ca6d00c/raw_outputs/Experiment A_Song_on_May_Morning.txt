Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the provided stanza as follows:

NOW the bright morning-star, Day's harbinger, [Beauty/Joy]
Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her [Beauty/Joy]
The flowery May, who from her green lap throws [Beauty/Joy]
The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose. [Beauty/Joy]
Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire [Vitality]
Mirth, and youth, and warm desire! [Vitality]
Woods and groves are of thy dressing; [Beauty/Joy]
Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing. [Beauty/Joy]
Thus we salute thee with our early song, [Beauty/Joy]
And welcome thee, and wish thee long. [Beauty/Joy]
