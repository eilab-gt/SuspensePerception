Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Success is counted sweetest [Beauty/Joy]
By those who ne'er succeed . [Sadness]
To comprehend a nectar [Beauty/Joy]
Requires sorest need . [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "Success is counted sweetest" evokes a sense of beauty and joy, as it suggests that success is a desirable and pleasing thing.
* The second line "By those who ne'er succeed" introduces a sense of sadness, as it implies that those who have not succeeded are the ones who truly understand the value of success.
* The third line "To comprehend a nectar" continues the theme of beauty and joy, as "nectar" is a sweet and pleasant substance.
* The fourth line "Requires sorest need" again introduces a sense of sadness, as it suggests that one must experience great need or hardship in order to truly appreciate the sweetness of success.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is a mix of beauty/joy and sadness, as the poem contrasts the two ideas of success and failure.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Not one of all the purple host [Sadness]
Who took the flag to-day [Sadness]
Can tell the definition , [Beauty/Joy]
So clear , of victory , [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "Not one of all the purple host" evokes a sense of sadness, as it implies that none of the soldiers who took the flag have survived or are able to tell the tale.
* The second line "Who took the flag to-day" continues the theme of sadness, as it reinforces the idea that the soldiers who took the flag are no longer present.
* The third line "Can tell the definition" shifts the tone to one of beauty and joy, as it suggests that there is a clear and triumphant definition of victory.

As he , defeated , dying , [Sadness]
On whose forbidden ear [Sadness]
The distant strains of triumph [Uneasiness] [Suspense]
Break , agonized and clear ! [Uneasiness] [Suspense]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "As he , defeated , dying" evokes a sense of sadness, as it describes a person who is defeated and dying.
* The second line "On whose forbidden ear" continues the theme of sadness, as it suggests that the person is not allowed to hear something.
* The third line "The distant strains of triumph" shifts the tone to one of uneasiness and suspense, as it suggests that the person is hearing the sounds of triumph, but they are distant and perhaps unsettling.
* The fourth line "Break , agonized and clear !" continues the theme of uneasiness and suspense, as it suggests that the sounds of triumph are breaking through, but they are agonized and clear, implying a sense of pain and discomfort.

Overall, the dominant emotions in this stanza are sadness, uneasiness, and suspense, as the poem describes a person who is defeated and dying, and is hearing the distant sounds of triumph, which are unsettling and painful.
