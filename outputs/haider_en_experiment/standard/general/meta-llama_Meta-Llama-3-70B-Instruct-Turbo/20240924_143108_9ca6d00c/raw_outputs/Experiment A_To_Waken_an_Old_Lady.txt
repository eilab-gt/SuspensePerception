Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza as follows:

OLD age is [Sadness]
a flight of small [Sadness]
cheeping birds [Beauty/Joy]
skimming [Beauty/Joy]
bare trees above a snow glaze. [Sadness]
Gaining and failing [Sadness]
they are buffeted [Sadness]
by a dark wind--[Sadness]
But what? [Suspense]
On harsh weedstalks [Uneasiness]
the flock has rested, [Beauty/Joy]
the snow [Beauty/Joy]
is covered with broken [Sadness]
seedhusks [Sadness]
and the wind tempered [Beauty/Joy]
by a shrill [Beauty/Joy]
piping of plenty. [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning for each line:

* Lines 1-3: The imagery of old age and bare trees evokes a sense of sadness and melancholy.
* Lines 4-5: The "cheeping birds" and "skimming" create a sense of beauty and joy, but it's tempered by the overall sadness of the scene.
* Lines 6-8: The "dark wind" and "buffeted" create a sense of unease and sadness.
* Line 9: The question "But what?" creates a sense of suspense and curiosity.
* Lines 10-11: The "harsh weedstalks" create a sense of uneasiness, but the "flock has rested" suggests a sense of beauty and joy.
* Lines 12-13: The "broken seedhusks" evoke a sense of sadness, but the "shrill piping of plenty" suggests a sense of beauty and joy.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is sadness, but there are moments of beauty and joy throughout.
