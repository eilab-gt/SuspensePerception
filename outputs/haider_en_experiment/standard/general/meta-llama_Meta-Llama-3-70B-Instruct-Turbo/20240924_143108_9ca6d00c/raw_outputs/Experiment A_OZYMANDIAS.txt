Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

I met a traveller from an antique land [Awe/Sublime]
Who said : Two vast and trunkless legs of stone [Awe/Sublime]
Stand in the desert ... Near them , on the sand , [Awe/Sublime]
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown , [Sadness]
And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , [Uneasiness]
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read [Awe/Sublime]
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things , [Awe/Sublime]
The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed : [Uneasiness]
And on the pedestal these words appear : [Suspense]
‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings : [Awe/Sublime]
Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! ’ [Awe/Sublime]
Nothing beside remains . [Sadness]
Round the decay [Sadness]
Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare [Awe/Sublime]
The lone and level sands stretch far away . [Awe/Sublime]
