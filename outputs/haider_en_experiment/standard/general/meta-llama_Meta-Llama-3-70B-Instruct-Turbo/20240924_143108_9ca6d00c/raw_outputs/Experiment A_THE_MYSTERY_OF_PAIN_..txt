Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Pain has an element of blank ; [Sadness]
It cannot recollect [Sadness]
When it began , or if there were [Sadness]
A day when it was not . [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the poem is describing pain as an overwhelming and all-encompassing experience that cannot be recalled or escaped. The tone is melancholic and introspective, evoking feelings of sadness and despair. The use of words like "blank" and "cannot recollect" creates a sense of hopelessness and desolation, which further reinforces the emotion of sadness.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

It has no future but itself , [Sadness]
Its infinite realms contain [Sadness]
Its past , enlightened to perceive [Sadness]
New periods of pain . [Sadness]

My reasoning is that the poem is describing a state of being that is trapped in its own existence, with no future or escape, and is burdened by its past and the prospect of new pain. The tone is melancholic and introspective, evoking feelings of sadness and despair. The use of words like "no future", "pain", and "enlightened to perceive" creates a sense of hopelessness and desolation, which further reinforces the emotion of sadness.
