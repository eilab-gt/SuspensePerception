Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza as follows:

Happy the man, and happy he alone, [Beauty/Joy]
He who can call today his own: [Beauty/Joy]
He who, secure within, can say, [Vitality]
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today. [Vitality]
Be fair or foul or rain or shine [Vitality]
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine. [Vitality]
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power, [Vitality]
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour. [Vitality]

My annotations are based on the emotions evoked by each line. The first two lines evoke a sense of happiness and joy, so I labeled them as [Beauty/Joy]. The third and fourth lines convey a sense of confidence and security, which I associate with vitality, so I labeled them as [Vitality]. The last four lines continue to express a sense of empowerment and satisfaction, which also fall under the category of vitality. Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is vitality, with beauty and joy present in the first two lines.
