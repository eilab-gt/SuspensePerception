Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the given stanza as follows:

If you can keep your head when all about you [Vitality]
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, [Vitality]
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, [Vitality]
But make allowance for their doubting too; [Vitality]
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, [Vitality]
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, [Vitality]
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, [Vitality]
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: [Vitality]

The dominant emotion I feel while reading this stanza is Vitality. The language used is encouraging and motivational, urging the reader to stay calm, trust themselves, and maintain their integrity in the face of adversity. The tone is uplifting and inspiring, which aligns with the definition of Vitality as an emotion that "has an inciting, encouraging effect" and "conveys a feeling of movement, energy and vitality".
Here is the annotated stanza:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; [Vitality]
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; [Vitality]
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster [Vitality]
And treat those two impostors just the same; [Vitality]
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken [Vitality]
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, [Uneasiness]
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, [Sadness]
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: [Vitality]

However, I also feel a sense of Uneasiness in line 6, as the image of truth being twisted by knaves to trap fools creates a sense of discomfort and mistrust. Additionally, I feel a sense of Sadness in line 7, as the idea of watching something you've given your life to being broken is a painful and sorrowful experience.

If you can make one heap of all your winnings [Vitality]
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, [Vitality]
And lose, and start again at your beginnings [Vitality]
And never breathe a word about your loss; [Vitality]
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew [Vitality]
