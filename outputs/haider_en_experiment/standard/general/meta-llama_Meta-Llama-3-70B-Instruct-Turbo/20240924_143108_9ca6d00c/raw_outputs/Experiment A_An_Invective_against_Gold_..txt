Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Of all the Poisons that the fruitful Earth [Annoyance]
E"er yet brought forth , or Monsters she gave Birth , [Annoyance]
Nought to Mankind has e"er so fatal been , [Sadness] [Annoyance]
As thou , accursed Gold , their Care and Sin . [Annoyance]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first line sets a negative tone, implying that the earth has produced something harmful, which evokes a sense of annoyance.
* The second line continues this negative tone, using the word "Monsters" to emphasize the harmful nature of what the earth has brought forth, which also evokes annoyance.
* The third line takes a more somber tone, using the word "fatal" to describe the impact of gold on humanity, which evokes sadness. The annoyance from the previous lines is still present, but the sadness takes precedence.
* The fourth line continues to condemn gold, using the word "accursed" to emphasize its negative impact, which evokes annoyance.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is annoyance, with sadness playing a secondary role in the third line.
