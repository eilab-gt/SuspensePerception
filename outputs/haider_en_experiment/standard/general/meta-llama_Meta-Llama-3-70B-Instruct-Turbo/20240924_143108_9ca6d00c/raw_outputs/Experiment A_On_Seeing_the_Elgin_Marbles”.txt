Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

My spirit is too weak—mortality [Sadness]
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, [Sadness]
And each imagined pinnacle and steep [Awe/Sublime]
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die [Sadness]
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky. [Sadness]
Yet ‘tis a gentle luxury to weep, [Beauty/Joy]
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep, [Beauty/Joy]
Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye. [Beauty/Joy]
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain [Awe/Sublime]
Bring round the heart an indescribable feud; [Uneasiness]
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, [Uneasiness]
That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude [Awe/Sublime]
Wasting of old Time—with a billowy main— [Awe/Sublime]
A sun—a shadow of a magnitude. [Awe/Sublime]

Here's my annotation:

* Lines 1-2: The speaker's mortality weighs heavily on them, evoking feelings of sadness.
* Line 3: The idea of godlike hardship is awe-inspiring and sublime.
* Lines 4-5: The speaker's mortality and weakness evoke sadness again.
* Lines 6-8: The luxury of weeping and the beauty of the morning's eye bring a sense of beauty and joy.
* Line 9: The glories of the brain are awe-inspiring and sublime.
* Lines 10-11: The pain and feud in the heart evoke uneasiness.
* Lines 12-14: The mingling of grandeur and the wasting of time evoke a sense of awe and sublimity.

Note: I've used a mix of emotions to annotate the stanza, as the speaker's emotions seem to shift throughout the poem.
