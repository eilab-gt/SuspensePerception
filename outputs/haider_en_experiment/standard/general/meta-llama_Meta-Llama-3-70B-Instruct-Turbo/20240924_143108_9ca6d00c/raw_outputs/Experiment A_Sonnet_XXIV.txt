I'll annotate the provided stanza according to the guidelines:

Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife, [Uneasiness]
Shut in upon itself and do no harm [Beauty/Joy]
In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm, [Beauty/Joy]
And let us hear no sound of human strife [Beauty/Joy]
After the click of the shutting. Life to life â€” [Beauty/Joy]
I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm, [Beauty/Joy]
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm [Beauty/Joy]
Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife [Uneasiness]
Are weak to injure. Very-whitely still [Beauty/Joy]
The lilies of our lives may reassure [Beauty/Joy]
Their blossoms from their roots, accessible [Beauty/Joy]
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer [Awe/Sublime]
Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill. [Awe/Sublime]
God only, who made us rich, can make us poor. [Sadness]

Here's my annotation:

* Lines 1 and 8 have an uneasy tone, so I chose Uneasiness.
* Lines 2-7 have a peaceful and loving tone, so I chose Beauty/Joy.
* Lines 10-12 have a sense of reassurance and beauty, so I chose Beauty/Joy again.
* Lines 13-14 have an awe-inspiring and sublime tone, so I chose Awe/Sublime.
* Line 15 has a sad and introspective tone, so I chose Sadness.

Note that I've followed the guidelines to use as few emotions as possible, choosing the dominant emotion for each line and adding a secondary emotion only when necessary.
