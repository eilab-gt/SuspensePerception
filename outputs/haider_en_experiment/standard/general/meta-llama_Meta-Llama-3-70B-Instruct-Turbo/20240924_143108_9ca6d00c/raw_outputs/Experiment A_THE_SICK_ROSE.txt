Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

O rose , thou art sick ! [Sadness]
The invisible worm , [Uneasiness]
That flies in the night , [Uneasiness]
In the howling storm , [Uneasiness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first line "O rose , thou art sick !" evokes a sense of sadness, as it describes the rose as being sick, which is a negative state.
* The second line "The invisible worm" creates a sense of uneasiness, as the idea of an invisible worm is unsettling and disturbing.
* The third line "That flies in the night" adds to the sense of uneasiness, as it creates an image of something unknown and potentially threatening moving in the darkness.
* The fourth line "In the howling storm" continues to create a sense of uneasiness, as the howling storm is a chaotic and intense environment.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is uneasiness, with a secondary emotion of sadness.
Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Has found out thy bed [Uneasiness]
Of crimson joy , [Uneasiness]
And his dark secret love [Uneasiness]
Does thy life destroy . [Sadness] [Uneasiness]

My reasoning is as follows:

* The first line "Has found out thy bed" creates a sense of uneasiness, as it implies a discovery of something private or hidden.
* The second line "Of crimson joy" adds to the sense of uneasiness, as the phrase "crimson joy" is ambiguous and could be interpreted as something dark or sinister.
* The third line "And his dark secret love" continues to create a sense of uneasiness, as it implies a hidden and potentially harmful passion.
* The fourth line "Does thy life destroy" evokes a sense of sadness, as it suggests a destructive force at work. The uneasiness from the previous lines is still present, as the destruction is likely related to the dark secret love.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is uneasiness, with a secondary emotion of sadness.
