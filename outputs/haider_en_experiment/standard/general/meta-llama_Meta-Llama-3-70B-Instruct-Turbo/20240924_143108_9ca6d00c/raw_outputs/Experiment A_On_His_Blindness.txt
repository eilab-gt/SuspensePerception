Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the given stanza as follows:

WHEN I consider how my light is spent [Sadness]
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide, [Sadness]
And that one Talent which is death to hide [Annoyance] [Sadness]
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent [Sadness]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "WHEN I consider how my light is spent" evokes a sense of sadness and regret, as the speaker is reflecting on the loss of their "light" or potential.
* The second line "Ere half my days in this dark world and wide" continues to convey a sense of sadness and despair, emphasizing the speaker's feeling of being stuck in a dark and difficult world.
* The third line "And that one Talent which is death to hide" introduces a sense of annoyance and frustration, as the speaker feels that their talent is being wasted or hidden. This line also still conveys sadness, as the speaker is aware of their own limitations.
* The fourth line "Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent" continues to express sadness, as the speaker feels that their talent is useless and unfulfilled, despite their soul's desire to be more productive.

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is sadness, with a secondary emotion of annoyance in the second line.
Based on the guidelines provided, I would annotate the given stanza as follows:

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is a mix of vitality and annoyance/sadness, as the speaker is motivated to serve their Maker but is also struggling with feelings of frustration and worry.
