Based on the guidelines, I would annotate the stanza as follows:

Music, when soft voices die, [Sadness]
Vibrates in the memory — [Beauty/Joy]
Odours, when sweet violets sicken, [Sadness]
Live within the sense they quicken. [Beauty/Joy]

Here's my reasoning:

* The first line "Music, when soft voices die" evokes a sense of sadness, as it implies the loss of something beautiful.
* The second line "Vibrates in the memory —" suggests that the memory of the music lives on, which is a beautiful and joyful thought.
* The third line "Odours, when sweet violets sicken" is again a sad thought, as it implies the loss of something pleasant.
* The fourth line "Live within the sense they quicken" suggests that the memory of the odors lives on, which is again a beautiful and joyful thought.

Overall, the stanza has a bittersweet tone, with both sad and joyful emotions present.
