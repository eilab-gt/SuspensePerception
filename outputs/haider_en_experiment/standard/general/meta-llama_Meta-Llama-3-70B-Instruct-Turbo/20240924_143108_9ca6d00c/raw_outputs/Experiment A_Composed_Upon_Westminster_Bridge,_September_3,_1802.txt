Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

Earth has not anything to show more fair: [Beauty/Joy]
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by [Beauty/Joy]
A sight so touching in its majesty: [Awe/Sublime]
This City now doth, like a garment, wear [Beauty/Joy]
The beauty of the morning: silent, bare, [Beauty/Joy]
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie [Beauty/Joy]
Open unto the fields, and to the sky; [Beauty/Joy]
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. [Beauty/Joy]
Never did sun more beautifully steep [Awe/Sublime]
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill; [Awe/Sublime]
Neâ€™er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep! [Awe/Sublime]
The river glideth at his own sweet will: [Beauty/Joy]
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep; [Beauty/Joy]
And all that mighty heart is lying still! [Beauty/Joy]

My annotations are based on the emotions evoked by each line. I've chosen the dominant emotion for each line, and in some cases, added a secondary emotion if it's relevant. The emotions I've chosen are:

* Beauty/Joy: lines 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13, as these lines evoke a sense of pleasure, happiness, and joy.
* Awe/Sublime: lines 3, 9, and 10, as these lines inspire a sense of wonder, grandeur, and majesty.

Note that I've followed the guidelines to use as few emotions as possible, and chosen the most dominant emotion for each line. I've also considered the context of the entire stanza while annotating each line.
