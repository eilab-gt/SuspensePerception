Here are the guidelines for labeling aesthetic emotions in poetry:

**Labels:**

1. **Annoyance** (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
2. **Awe/Sublime** (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
3. **Beauty/Joy** (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. **Humor** (found it funny/amusing)
5. **Nostalgia** (makes me nostalgic) - use with + beauty/joy or + sadness
6. **Sadness** (makes me sad/touches me)
7. **Suspense** (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
8. **Uneasiness** (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
9. **Vitality** (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)

**Instructions for Annotating:**

1. The annotation should reflect your current feelings while reading the poem.
2. Label your emotions after reading each individual line (not sentence!).
3. Read the entire stanza before annotating each line.
4. Use as few emotions as possible!
5. Choose at least one label per line.
6. You should not use more than two labels per line.
7. Choose the emotion most dominant while reading the stanza.
8. Choose another emotion if necessary.
9. Only change the dominant emotion within a stanza if unavoidable.
10. If you change the non-dominant emotion within a stanza, remember to keep labeling the dominant emotion additionally to the new emotion.

**Gold Standard:**

The following examples serve as an orientation for the annotators. The exemplarily emotion is highlighted.

**Examples:**

1. **Annoyance**: "In every cry of every Man, [Sadness] [Annoyance]"
2. **Awe/Sublime**: "The moving waters at their priestlike task [Awe / Sublime]"
3. **Beauty/Joy**: "i carry your heart with me(i carry it in [Beauty/Joy]"
4. **Humor**: "I'm Nobody! Who are you? [Humor]"
5. **Nostalgia**: "Thou'll break my heart, thou bonnie bird, [Sadness] [Nostalgia] [Sadness]"

7. **Suspense**: "The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out [Uneasiness] [Suspense]"
8. **Uneasiness**: "To wait in heavy harness [Uneasiness]"
9. **Vitality**: "Be fair or foul or rain or shine [Vitality]"

**Annotate the stanza:**

When my love swears that she is made of truth ,
I do believe her , though I know she lies ,
That she might think me some untutor "d youth ,
Unskilful in the world "s false forgeries ,
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young ,
Although I know my years be past the best ,
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue ,
Outfacing faults in love with love "s ill rest .
But wherefore says my love that she is young ?
And wherefore say not I that I am old ?
O , love "s best habit is a soothing tongue ,
And age , in love , loves not to have years told .
Therefore , I "ll lie with love , and love with me ,
Since that our faults in love thus smother "d be .

Please label your emotions after reading each line, considering the guidelines above.
