Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

1. Is there for honest Poverty
That hangs his head, an' a' that;
The coward slave — we pass him by,
We dare be poor for a' that!
For a' that, an' a' that.
Our toils obscure an' a' that,
The rank is but the guinea "s stamp,
The Man's the gowd for a' that.

* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me) ( dominant emotion)
* Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated) (non-dominant emotion)

Reasoning:
The stanza evokes feelings of sadness and frustration, as it describes the struggles of poverty and the dehumanization of the poor. The use of words like "coward", "slave", and "obscure" creates a sense of despair and hopelessness, which is a dominant emotion in this stanza. The non-dominant emotion of annoyance is present due to the frustration and anger felt towards the societal conditions that perpetuate poverty and inequality.

What though on hamely fare we dine ,
Wear hoddin grey , an' a that ;
Gie fools their silks , and knaves their wine ;

Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

Ye see yon birkie, ca "d a lord ,
Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that ;
Tho' hundreds worship at his word,
He's but a coof for a' that :
For a' that, an' a' that,
His ribband, star, an' a' that :
The man o' independent mind
He looks an' laughs at a' that .
