I'll help you label the aesthetic emotions in the given stanza.

**The expense of spirit in a waste of shame**
Is lust in action : and till action , lust
Is perjur "d , murderous , bloody , full of blame ,
Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust ;
Enjoy "d no sooner but despised straight ;
Past reason hunted ; and no sooner had ,
Past reason hated , as a swallow "d bait ,
On purpose laid to make the taker mad :
Mad in pursuit and in possession so ;
Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme ;
A bliss in proof ,— and prov "d , a very woe ;
Before , a joy propos "d ; behind a dream .
All this the world well knows ; yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .

I'll annotate the emotions as I read the stanza:

1. **Annoyance** (found it frustrating/angry) - "Is lust in action : and till action , lust" (I feel frustrated and annoyed by the idea of lust being in action)
2. **Sadness** (makes me sad/touches me) - "Is perjur "d , murderous , bloody , full of blame , Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust ;" (I feel a sense of sadness and despair at the description of lust)
3. **Annoyance** (found it frustrating/angry) - "Enjoy "d no sooner but despised straight ;" (I feel frustrated and annoyed by the idea of something being enjoyed only to be despised)
4. **Sadness** (makes me sad/touches me) - "Past reason hunted ; and no sooner had , Past reason hated , as a swallow "d bait , On purpose laid to make the taker mad : Mad in pursuit and in possession so ;" (I feel a sense of sadness and despair at the description of reason being hunted and hated)
5. **Sadness** (makes me sad/touches me) - "Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme ;" (I feel a sense of sadness and longing for something that is unattainable)
6. **Awe/Sublime** (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness) - "A bliss in proof ,— and prov "d , a very woe ;" (I feel a sense of awe and wonder at the idea of a bliss that is both proven and a source of woe)
7. **Sadness** (makes me sad/touches me) - "Before , a joy propos "d ; behind a dream . All this the world well knows ; yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell ." (I feel a sense of sadness and despair at the idea of a joy that is proposed but ultimately leads to a hell)

Overall, I would label this stanza as having a dominant emotion of **Sadness**, with undertones of **Annoyance** and **Awe/Sublime**.
