Here is the annotation of the stanza:

1. Nor dread nor hope attend
A dying animal;
A man awaits his end
Dreading and hoping all;
[Annoyance] [Sadness] (The line "A man awaits his end" evokes a sense of sadness and annoyance)

2. Many times he died,
Many times rose again,
A great man in his pride
Confronting murderous men
Casts derision upon
Supersession of breath;
[Annoyance] [Sadness] (The repeated cycles of death and rebirth are unsettling and sad)

3. He knows death to the bone â€“
Man has created death.
[Annoyance] [Sadness] [Awe/Sublime] (The line "Man has created death" is a powerful and unsettling statement that evokes a sense of awe and sadness)

Overall, the dominant emotion in this stanza is a mix of annoyance, sadness, and a sense of the sublime. The speaker is disturbed by the idea of death and the fact that humans have created it. The use of the word "bone" in the third line adds to the sense of unease and mortality.
