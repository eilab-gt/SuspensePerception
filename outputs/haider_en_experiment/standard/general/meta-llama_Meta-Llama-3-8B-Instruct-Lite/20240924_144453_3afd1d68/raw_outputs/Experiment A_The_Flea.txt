Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the stanza below:

Marke but this flea , and marke in this ,
How little that which thou deny"st me is ;
It suck "d me first , and now sucks thee ,
And in this flea , our two bloods mingled bee ;
Thou know"st that this cannot be said
A sinne , nor shame , nor losse of maidenhead ,
Yet this enjoyes before it wooe ,
And pamper "d swells with one blood made of two ,
And this , alas , is more then wee would doe .

This stanza does not evoke any strong emotions in me, and I do not find it particularly beautiful, funny, or thought-provoking. The language is formal and poetic, but it does not create a sense of unease or nostalgia. The emotions evoked are more subtle and nuanced, and I do not feel the need to label them.
Based on the guidelines, I will annotate the stanza below:

Oh stay , three lives in one flea spare ,
Where wee almost , yea more then maryed are .

Cruell and sodaine , hast thou since
Purpled thy naile , in blood of innocence ?
Wherein could this flea guilty bee ,
Except in that drop which it suckt from thee ?
Yet thou triumph"st , and saist that thou
Find"st not thy selfe , nor mee the weaker now ;
â€˜ Tis true , then learne how false , feares bee ; 25
Just so much honor , when thou yeeld"st to mee ,
Will wast , as this flea "s death tooke life from thee .
