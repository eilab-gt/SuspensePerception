Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
That only men incredulous of despair,
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,
[Sadness] (makes me sad)
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare
[Sadness] (makes me sad)
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare
[Uneasiness] (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—
[Sadness] (makes me sad)
Most like a monumental statue set
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
In everlasting watch and moveless woe
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.
Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:
[Annoyance] (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
If it could weep, it could arise and go.

Note: I have used the labels as follows:

* Annoyance: 7 times (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
* Sadness: 3 times (makes me sad)
* Uneasiness: 2 times (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)

Please let me know if this annotation is correct or if I need to make any changes.
