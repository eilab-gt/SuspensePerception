Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the stanza:

When first Alexis did in Verse delight ,
His Muse in Low , but Graceful Numbers walk"t ,
And now and then a little Proudly stalk"t ;
But never aim "d at any noble Flight :
The Herds , the Groves , the gentle purling Streams ,
Adorn "d his Song , and were his highest Theams .

1. "When first Alexis did in Verse delight" - Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
2. "His Muse in Low , but Graceful Numbers walk"t" - Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
3. "And now and then a little Proudly stalk"t" - Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
4. "But never aim "d at any noble Flight" - Annoyance (annoys me, angers me, felt frustrated)
5. "The Herds , the Groves , the gentle purling Streams" - Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
6. "Adorn "d his Song , and were his highest Theams" - Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)

Note: I used the label "Beauty/Joy" for the majority of the lines, as the language used is lyrical and evocative, creating a sense of delight and pleasure. The line "But never aim "d at any noble Flight" is the only one that evokes a sense of annoyance, as it suggests that the poet's aspirations are not lofty enough.
Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the stanza:

But Love these Thoughts , like Mists , did soon disperse ,
Enlarg "d his Fancy , and set free his Muse ,
Biding him more Illustrious Subjects choose ;
The Acts of Gods , and God-like Men reherse .
From thence new Raptures did his Breast inspire ,
His scarce Warm-Heart converted was to Fire .
