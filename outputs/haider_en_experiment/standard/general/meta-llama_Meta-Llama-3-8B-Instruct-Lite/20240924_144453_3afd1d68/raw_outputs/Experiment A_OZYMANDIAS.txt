Based on the provided guidelines, I will annotate the given stanza:

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said : Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert ... Near them , on the sand ,
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown ,
And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command ,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things ,
The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed :
And on the pedestal these words appear :
‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings :
Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair ! ’
Nothing beside remains . Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away .
