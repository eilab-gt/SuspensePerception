Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the given stanza:

OLD age is
a flight of small
cheeping birds
skimming
bare trees above a snow glaze.
Gaining and failing
they are buffeted
by a dark wind--
But what?
On harsh weedstalks
the flock has rested,
the snow
is covered with broken
seedhusks
and the wind tempered
by a shrill
piping of plenty.

1. "OLD age is" - Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness)
2. "a flight of small / cheeping birds / skimming / bare trees above a snow glaze" - Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/pleasing/makes me happy/joyful)
3. "Gaining and failing / they are buffeted / by a dark wind--" - Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful)
4. "But what?" - Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest)
5. "On harsh weedstalks / the flock has rested, / the snow / is covered with broken / seedhusks / and the wind tempered / by a shrill / piping of plenty" - Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me)
