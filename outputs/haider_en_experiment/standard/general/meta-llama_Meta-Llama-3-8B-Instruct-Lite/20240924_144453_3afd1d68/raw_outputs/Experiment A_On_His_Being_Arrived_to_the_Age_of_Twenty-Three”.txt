Based on the guidelines provided, I will annotate the stanza:

HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!
My hasting days fly on with full career,
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,
That I to manhood am arrived so near,
And inward ripeness doth much less appear,
That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th.
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,
It shall be still in strictest measure even
To that same lot, however mean or high,
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven,
All is, if I have grace to use it so,
As ever in my great Task-master’s eye

* Awe/Sublime (found it overwhelming/sense of greatness) - None
* Beauty/Joy (found it beautiful/ pleasing/ makes me happy/ joyful) - None
* Humor (found it funny/ amusing) - None
* Nostalgia (makes me nostalgic) - None
* Sadness (makes me sad/touches me) - "my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th" (line 5) and "That I to manhood am arrived so near, / And inward ripeness doth much less appear" (lines 7-8)
* Suspense (found it gripping/sparked my interest) - None
* Uneasiness (found it ugly/unsettling/disturbing/frightening/distasteful) - None
* Vitality (found it invigorating/spurs me on/inspires me) - "My hasting days fly on with full career" (line 3) and "It shall be still in strictest measure even / To that same lot, however mean or high" (lines 13-14)

Note: The dominant emotion in this stanza is Sadness, with the lines "my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th" and "That I to manhood am arrived so near, / And inward ripeness doth much less appear" evoking feelings of sadness and disappointment. The lines "My hasting days fly on with full career" and "It shall be still in strictest measure even / To that same lot, however mean or high" convey a sense of vitality and determination, but these emotions are not as dominant as the sadness.
