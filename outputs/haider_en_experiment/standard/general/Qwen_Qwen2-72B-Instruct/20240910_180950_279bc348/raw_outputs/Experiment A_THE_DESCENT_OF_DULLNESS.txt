Here are the annotations for the stanza provided:

In vain , in vain — the all-composing Hour [Uneasiness]
Resistless falls : the Muse obeys the Pow"r . [Uneasiness]
She comes ! she comes ! the sable Throne behold [Uneasiness]
Of Night primæval and of Chaos old ! [Uneasiness]
Before her , Fancy "s gilded clouds decay , [Uneasiness]
And all its varying Rain-bows die away . [Uneasiness]
Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires , [Uneasiness]
The meteor drops , and in a flash expires . [Uneasiness]
As one by one , at dread Medea "s strain , [Uneasiness]
The sick"ning stars fade off th ’ ethereal plain ; [Uneasiness]
As Argus ’ eyes by Hermes ’ wand opprest , [Uneasiness]
Clos "d one by one to everlasting rest ; [Uneasiness]
Thus at her felt approach , and secret might , [Uneasiness]
Art after Art goes out , and all is Night . [Uneasiness]
See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled , [Uneasiness]
Mountains of Casuistry heap "d o"er her head ! [Uneasiness]
Philosophy , that lean "d on Heav"n before , [Uneasiness]
Shrinks to her second cause , and is no more . [Uneasiness]
Physic of Metaphysic begs defence , [Uneasiness]
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense ! [Uneasiness]
See Mystery to Mathematics fly ! [Uneasiness]
In vain ! they gaze , turn giddy , rave , and die . [Uneasiness]
Religion blushing veils her sacred fires , [Uneasiness]
And unawares Morality expires . [Uneasiness]
For public Flame , nor private , dares to shine ; [Uneasiness]
Nor human Spark is left , nor Glimpse divine ! [Uneasiness]
Lo ! thy dread Empire , CHAOS ! is restor "d ; [Uneasiness]
Light dies before thy uncreating word ; [Uneasiness]
Thy hand , great Anarch ! lets the curtain fall , [Uneasiness]
And universal Darkness buries All . [Uneasiness]
