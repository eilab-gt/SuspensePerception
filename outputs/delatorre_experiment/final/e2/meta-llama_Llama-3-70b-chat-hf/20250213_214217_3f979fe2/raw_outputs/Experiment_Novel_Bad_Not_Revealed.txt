I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts with a hook that grabs the reader's attention: "What you are about to read is the story of a real event..." This creates a sense of intrigue and makes the reader curious about what's to come.
* The setup of the story is well-done, establishing the context and stakes of the situation: a young boy is waiting for a liver transplant, and his situation is critical. This creates tension and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert survive?" and "What will happen next?"
* However, the paragraph doesn't quite reach a 9 out of 9 because it's more of a setup than a cliffhanger. The reader is told that "this is the story of what happened," which implies that the story will be told in a straightforward manner, rather than leaving the reader with a sense of uncertainty or a dramatic twist.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating tension, but it could be more suspenseful if it ended with a more dramatic or unexpected turn of events.
