I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing a critical situation (a boy waiting for a liver transplant) and creating a sense of urgency (the boy's situation is critical and he may not survive the wait). The use of specific details like the date, time, and location adds to the sense of realism and makes the situation feel more immediate.

However, the paragraph also gives away the ending (Robert dies without receiving the transplant) which reduces the suspense. If the paragraph had ended with a cliffhanger, such as "But just as they were about to begin the surgery, disaster struck..." or "And then, something unexpected happened...", it would have been more suspenseful.

Additionally, the tone of the paragraph is more informative and matter-of-fact than suspenseful or dramatic, which also reduces the overall sense of suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph is quite straightforward and lacks any sense of tension or suspense. The use of a specific time (08:57) adds a sense of precision, but it doesn't create any sense of urgency or anticipation. The phrase "punctually on the roof of the hospital" implies that everything is going according to plan, which reduces any potential suspense.

Additionally, the fact that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that he's not in immediate danger, which further reduces the sense of suspense. Overall, the paragraph feels more like a neutral, factual report than a suspenseful narrative.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the dramatic arrival of the helicopter and the two men descending from it. The use of vivid details like "heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades" and "ducking down" creates a sense of intensity and raises the stakes.

The fact that the men are in a hurry and "had no time to lose" adds to the sense of urgency, and the mention of the patient's "critical situation" creates a sense of danger and raises the stakes. The use of specific details like the temperature of the liver (four degrees centigrade) and the fact that it's "fully functioning" adds to the sense of realism and makes the situation feel more immediate.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively straightforward description of events, and there's no major twist or surprise. The tension is created more through the atmosphere and the situation than through any sudden revelations or plot twists.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is extremely low on suspense. It's a mundane and detailed description of a cleaner's daily routine, with no sense of tension, urgency, or danger. The tone is casual and matter-of-fact, with the cleaner even whistling as he works. The description of the service stairwell is equally uneventful, with no hints of anything out of the ordinary.

The paragraph is so focused on the mundane details of the cleaner's job that it's hard to imagine how it could be connected to the more dramatic events described in previous paragraphs. There's no sense of foreboding or foreshadowing, and no hint that anything is about to go wrong. Overall, this paragraph is a complete departure from the suspenseful tone of the previous paragraphs, and feels like a deliberate attempt to create a sense of normalcy and routine.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the men's hurry to reach the patient on the 6th floor. The fact that they decide to take the stairs instead of the lift because it's faster adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

The description of the hospital's layout and the men's movement through it creates a sense of realism and makes the situation feel more immediate. The use of specific details like the metal ramp, the service stairwell, and the east wing lift adds to the sense of authenticity.

However, the paragraph is still relatively straightforward and lacks any major twists or surprises. The men's conversation is brief and to the point, and there's no sense of conflict or tension between them. The paragraph is more focused on setting the scene and advancing the plot than on creating suspense or tension. Overall, while it's a well-written paragraph, it's not particularly suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of sudden and unexpected danger. The man's foot slipping on the first step is a shocking and unexpected event that raises the stakes and creates tension. The fact that he lets go of the case to grab the bannister adds to the sense of urgency and danger, and the image of the case rolling down the stairs is terrifying.

The use of vivid and evocative language, such as "twisting his ankle", "reached out to grab hold of the bannister", and "making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag" adds to the sense of realism and makes the scene feel more immediate and intense. The fact that the two men "held their breath" and watched in "horror" adds to the sense of tension and suspense.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's a relatively self-contained moment of suspense, and the outcome is not entirely uncertain. We can guess that the case will likely reach the bottom of the stairs without too much damage, and the men will likely recover from the shock. However, the paragraph is still extremely effective at creating a sense of tension and suspense, and it's a major turning point in the story.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is a bit of a letdown after the intense suspense of the previous paragraph. While it's still a tense and urgent moment, the fact that the case has stopped at the bottom of the stairs and the men are kneeling beside it creates a sense of relief and tension release.

The conversation between the two men is brief and to the point, and while it's clear that they're concerned about the potential damage to the case, the tone is more cautious and careful than suspenseful. The fact that they decide to call the doctors and wait for their assessment adds to the sense of caution and reduces the sense of urgency.

The description of the man's journey down the stairs and through the hospital corridors is also relatively straightforward and lacks any sense of tension or suspense. The use of phrases like "without wasting any time" and "walked quickly" adds to the sense of urgency, but overall the paragraph feels more like a transition or a setup for the next scene rather than a suspenseful moment in its own right.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and uncertainty around the condition of the liver. The fact that the colleague is standing still, holding onto the bannister, and trying not to think about the possibility of damage adds to the sense of anxiety and fear.

The use of vivid and evocative language, such as "keeping a firm hold on the bannister", "trying to think of anything except", and "overwhelmed by the superstition" adds to the sense of realism and makes the scene feel more immediate and intense. The fact that the colleague is in physical pain, but is willing to endure it in order to somehow protect the liver, adds to the sense of desperation and urgency.

The sudden arrival of the doctors, rushing up the stairs, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The fact that they ask the colleague to "move away, please" creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty, and raises the question of what they will find when they open the case.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's a relatively slow-burning sense of suspense, and the outcome is still uncertain. However, the paragraph is extremely effective at creating a sense of tension and anxiety, and it's a major turning point in the story.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty around the condition of the liver. The use of specific and detailed language, such as "He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs" and "the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge" adds to the sense of realism and makes the scene feel more immediate and intense.

The brief pause before the doctor turns to those watching, shaking his head, creates a sense of dread and foreboding. The fact that the doctor closes the case without saying a word adds to the sense of suspense and raises the question of what has happened to the liver.

The final sentence, "The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping" is a masterclass in suspenseful writing. The use of vivid and evocative language, such as "ruptured", "long split", and "thin stream of refrigerated air" creates a sense of horror and despair. The fact that the refrigerated air is "slowly escaping" adds to the sense of inevitability and tragedy, and raises the stakes to a critical level.

Overall, this paragraph is a perfect example of how to create suspense through careful pacing, vivid language, and a deep understanding of the reader's emotions.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of high stakes and intense pressure. The fact that the medical team is examining the liver to determine its viability for transplantation creates a sense of urgency and importance.

The use of specific and technical language, such as "interior polyurethane bag", "hepatology laboratory", "enzyme activity", and "metabolic rate" adds to the sense of realism and makes the scene feel more immediate and intense.

The description of the surgeon's nervousness and the high stakes of the biopsy procedure creates a sense of tension and suspense. The fact that the surgeon has carried out numerous biopsies before, but never with a child's life hanging in the balance, adds to the sense of pressure and raises the stakes.

The final sentence, "If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably" is a masterclass in suspenseful writing. The use of the phrase "one millimetre out" creates a sense of precision and delicacy, and the consequence of failure is dire and irreversible. This sentence raises the tension to a critical level and makes the reader feel like they are holding their breath, waiting to see what will happen next.

Overall, this paragraph is a perfect example of how to create suspense through careful pacing, vivid language, and a deep understanding of the reader's emotions.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of high stakes and intense pressure. The surgeon is performing a delicate procedure, and the outcome is uncertain. The use of specific and technical language, such as "inserted the needle one centimetre", "drew out the plunger", and "Petri dish" adds to the sense of realism and makes the scene feel more immediate and intense.

The description of the surgeon's relief and then concern creates a sense of tension and suspense. The fact that he wipes the sweat from his brow and looks anxiously at his colleagues adds to the sense of pressure and raises the stakes.

The use of phrases like "interminable half a minute" and "sporadically pursed his lips" creates a sense of slow-burning tension and anticipation. The reader is left wondering what the surgeon will find, and the delay in revealing the diagnosis adds to the suspense.

The final sentence, "The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact" is a masterclass in suspenseful writing. The use of the phrase "worst fears" creates a sense of dread and foreboding, and the revelation that the organ has deteriorated is a devastating blow. The reader is left feeling shocked and concerned for the patient's fate.

Overall, this paragraph is a perfect example of how to create suspense through careful pacing, vivid language, and a deep understanding of the reader's emotions.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is not suspenseful at all. In fact, it's more of a resolution or a conclusion to the story. The sentence is straightforward and to the point, and it doesn't create any sense of tension or uncertainty. The outcome is already known, and the reader is simply being informed of the final result.

There's no build-up, no anticipation, and no sense of drama or surprise. The sentence is more of a summary or a wrap-up, and it doesn't have any of the elements that would make it suspenseful.

In fact, this paragraph is more of a release of tension, as the reader has been waiting to find out what would happen to Robert Bent, and now they finally know. The suspense has been resolved, and the story has come to a close.
