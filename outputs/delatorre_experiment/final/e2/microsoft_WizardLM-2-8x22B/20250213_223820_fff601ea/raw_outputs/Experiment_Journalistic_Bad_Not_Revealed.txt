This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—and emphasizing punctuality, which suggests that every second counts. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" creates a balance between hope and the potential for disaster, maintaining the reader's tension. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the location (the roof of the hospital) contributes to the sense of immediacy and the importance of the moment. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually," which implies that things are going according to plan, reducing the sense of unpredictability that often fuels suspense.

This paragraph introduces a visual and procedural element to the narrative, which contributes to the suspense by highlighting the careful handling of the organ, which is crucial for the success of the transplant. The specific description of the "small blue fridge, in the shape of a case," adds a tangible sense of urgency as it is clearly identified as the container for the life-saving liver. The presence of "two men" suggests a team effort and the importance of the moment, but the suspense is moderated by the fact that the men have successfully landed and are in the process of transporting the organ, indicating that the mission is proceeding as planned. The focus on the object—the fridge—rather than the potential complications or emotional stakes, slightly reduces the suspense level compared to the previous paragraphs.

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could have significant consequences, thereby adding a layer of suspense. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and failing to display a "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it sets up a scenario where an accident could occur, potentially impacting the critical mission of delivering the organ. The timing, "minutes earlier," suggests that the events are unfolding in real-time and that the characters, including the medical team and the men carrying the organ, may be unknowingly heading towards a dangerous situation. This element of an unseen obstacle or oversight can be quite suspenseful, as it hints at a possible complication that could jeopardize the operation's success. However, the suspense is not as immediate or directly tied to the central tension of the transplant as it could be, which is why it might be rated slightly lower on the suspense scale.

This paragraph introduces a decision made by the characters that could lead to a critical situation, given the earlier information about the wet floor in the service stairwell. The choice to use the stairwell rather than an alternative route raises the stakes and introduces an element of risk, which contributes to the suspense. However, the suspense is somewhat muted because the paragraph does not yet reveal any consequences of this decision. It sets up a potential problem without confirming whether the problem will materialize, which leaves the reader in a state of anticipation rather than immediate tension. The suspense level is moderate because the narrative has not yet reached a point of conflict or danger resulting from the decision to use the service stairwell.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense by depicting the immediate consequence of the earlier setup with the wet floor. The moment of the slip is sudden and critical, as it directly threatens the success of the liver delivery and, by extension, the life of the boy awaiting the transplant. The vivid description of the case "plunging down the stairs" creates a strong visual image of chaos and potential disaster, which is the essence of suspenseful storytelling. The reader is likely to feel a surge of tension due to the high stakes and the uncertainty of the outcome following this accident. The suspense is intense because the narrative has reached a climactic point where the characters' goals are in serious jeopardy, and the resolution is yet to be revealed.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by showing the immediate reactions of the characters to the crisis. The colleague's urgent action to warn the doctors introduces a race against time and emphasizes the gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, the other man's decision to stay with the case and ensure it is not mishandled adds to the tension, as the reader is left to wonder about the condition of the liver inside the case. The specific detail that the case "was not handled in any way" until the doctors arrived suggests that there may be protocols to prevent further damage, which could be critical to the transplant's success. The suspense is sustained by the uncertainty of the outcome and the anticipation of the doctors' assessment of the situation, keeping the reader engaged and concerned about the consequences of the accident.

This paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution, which can reduce the level of suspense compared to the previous paragraphs. The prompt arrival of the doctors suggests that the situation is being addressed quickly, which is a positive development in the narrative. However, the paragraph does not reveal any details about the condition of the liver or the implications of the fall, so there is still some level of suspense regarding the outcome. The reader is likely curious about what the doctors will find and whether the organ is still viable for transplantation. The suspense is moderate because the narrative has reached a turning point where the immediate crisis has been met with a swift response, but the final consequences remain unclear.

This paragraph re-escalates the suspense by revealing a significant complication: the rupture of the interior bag containing the liver. This discovery raises the stakes and introduces new uncertainty about the viability of the organ for transplant. The specific detail of the bag's rupture creates a vivid image of potential disaster and directly impacts the central tension of the story—whether Robert Bent will receive the life-saving transplant. The reader is left hanging on the precipice of a negative outcome, which is a hallmark of suspenseful storytelling. The suspense is intense because the narrative has reached a critical juncture where the characters face a serious setback, and the resolution is still unknown, keeping the reader fully engaged and anxious about the characters' fate.

This paragraph sustains suspense by introducing a crucial step in assessing the condition of the liver—a biopsy to study its viability. The specific mention of the "hepatic laboratory" and the "surgeon responsible" adds a sense of urgency and professionalism to the situation, emphasizing the importance of the procedure. The reader is kept in suspense because the outcome of the biopsy is not yet revealed, and the fate of the organ, as well as the boy awaiting the transplant, hangs in the balance. The suspense is moderate to high because the narrative has reached a point where the characters are actively working to resolve the crisis, but the success of their efforts is still uncertain, maintaining the reader's tension and concern for the story's resolution.

This paragraph delivers a significant and suspenseful twist by revealing that the liver has been damaged beyond use due to the impact of the fall. The definitive statement that "it was impossible to use the organ for the transplant" creates a sense of finality and raises the stakes dramatically. The reader is confronted with the dire consequences of the earlier accident, and the tension is heightened by the implications for Robert Bent's survival. This moment of revelation is highly suspenseful because it represents a major setback in the narrative, leaving the reader to grapple with the uncertainty of what will happen next and whether there is any hope left for the boy in need of a transplant. The suspense is intense as the characters—and the reader—face the potential tragic outcome of the story.

This paragraph brings a sense of resolution and closure to the narrative, which typically reduces suspense. The announcement of Robert Bent's death, due to the inability to perform the liver transplant, is tragic and confirms the worst-case scenario that has been building throughout the story. While the confirmation of the outcome is emotionally impactful, the suspense is significantly lessened because the primary tension of the story—whether Robert will survive—has been resolved. The specific time of death (21:26) provides a somber bookend to the narrative, which began with anticipation and ends with loss. The suspense level is moderate because, although the conclusion is sad and final, the uncertainty that fuels suspense has been largely removed. However, the paragraph may still evoke a strong emotional response and a sense of what might have been, which can linger in the reader's mind.
