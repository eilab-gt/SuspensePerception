This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It introduces a seemingly mundane activity—a cleaner performing his daily routine—which contrasts with the high-stakes medical drama unfolding elsewhere in the hospital. The detail about the cleaner not placing "wet floor" signs creates a sense of foreboding, as it suggests the potential for an accident that could intersect with the urgent liver transplant situation. The mention of the service stairwell, which is typically unused and without windows, adds a sense of isolation and sets the stage for a possible unforeseen event. The reader is likely to anticipate that this detail could become significant later in the story, which contributes to the suspense. However, the suspense is more subtle and slower-building here than in the previous paragraphs, as the connection between the cleaner's actions and the critical situation with Robert is not yet clear.
