 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The narrative sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant, the critical condition of the young boy, and the uncertainty about the donor organ's condition. The suspense is further heightened by the specific time details and the build-up to the crucial moment of verification. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more emotional context or described the emotions of the characters involved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale.

The clock was ticking, and every second counted as the team raced against time to perform the transplant and give Robert a chance at a new life.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the suspensefulness scale. While the mention of the cleaner mopping the floor adds a sense of tension, it does not directly relate to the critical situation of Robert Bent or the transplant.

The cleaner's negligence had put the entire transplant at risk, and the team had to work even harder to save Robert's life.
