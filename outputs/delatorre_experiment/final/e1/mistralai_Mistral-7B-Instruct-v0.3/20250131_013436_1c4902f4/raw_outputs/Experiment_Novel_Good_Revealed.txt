 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The narrative sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant, the critical condition of the young boy, and the uncertainty about the donor organ's condition. The suspense is further heightened by the specific time details and the build-up to the crucial moment of verification. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more emotional context or described the emotions of the characters involved.
