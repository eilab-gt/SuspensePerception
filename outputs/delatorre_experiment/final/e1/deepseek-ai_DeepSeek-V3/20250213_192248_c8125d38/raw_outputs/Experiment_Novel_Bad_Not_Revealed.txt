I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The mention of uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait adds tension. The specific details (date, location, and names) also lend credibility and immediacy to the story.
  
- **Weaknesses**: While the stakes are high, the paragraph doesn't fully immerse the reader in the emotional or sensory details that could heighten suspense. The tone is somewhat matter-of-fact, and there’s no immediate action or cliffhanger to grip the reader. The phrase "This is the story of what happened" feels more like a setup than a suspenseful moment.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could include more vivid descriptions of Robert’s condition, the ticking clock, or the emotional state of the medical team or family.

I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph delivers a tragic and emotionally charged conclusion, which carries significant weight and impact. The specific time ("21:26") adds a sense of finality, and the revelation that Robert’s death was caused by the damaged organ creates a somber and reflective moment. The stakes are clear, and the outcome is devastating, which resonates with the reader.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could include a moment of hesitation or uncertainty before the certification of death, or it could hint at the emotional aftermath for the medical team or Robert’s family.
