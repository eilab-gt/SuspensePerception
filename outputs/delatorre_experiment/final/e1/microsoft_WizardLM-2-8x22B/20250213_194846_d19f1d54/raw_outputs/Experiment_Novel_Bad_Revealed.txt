The paragraph sets up a scenario with inherent tension—a young boy's life hanging in the balance as he awaits a liver transplant. The mention of the critical nature of his condition and the uncertainty of whether he would survive the wait introduces an element of suspense. However, the suspense is somewhat undercut by the revelation at the end that the boy, Robert Bent, did not survive. The narrative structure of foreshadowing his death diminishes the suspense because it removes the element of uncertainty regarding his fate. The reader is prepared for the tragic outcome, which lessens the tension that might have been sustained if the outcome had been left more ambiguous.

This paragraph introduces a moment of heightened tension with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the life-saving organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival by helicopter adds urgency to the scene. However, the suspense is moderate because the paragraph provides a snapshot of a single moment without delving into the complexities or potential complications that could arise. The reader is aware that the organ has arrived, which suggests progress in the situation, but there is no immediate threat or obstacle presented in this sentence alone. The suspense lies in what will happen next and whether the transplant will be successful, but without further context or complications, the suspense is not at its peak.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level. The vivid description of the men emerging from the helicopter with the urgency conveyed by their actions and the environment's chaos creates a tense atmosphere. The blue case holding the liver at a precise, life-preserving temperature is a focal point of suspense, as it represents the hope for the patient's survival. The inaudible shouting and the need for non-verbal communication due to the noise heighten the sense of urgency. The specific detail of one man pointing to his watch and then to the doorway suggests that time is of the essence, adding to the suspense. The final sentence, which reveals the critical condition of the patient and the need for haste, leaves the reader anxious about whether the team will be able to deliver the organ in time to save the patient's life. This paragraph effectively builds suspense by focusing on the immediacy and potential obstacles in the race against time.

This paragraph has a lower level of suspense. It provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine work, which, while it sets the scene and establishes a sense of normalcy, does not inherently create a sense of danger or impending crisis. The mundane nature of the job and the cleaner's habits, such as whistling while he works and not using "wet floor" signs, are mentioned, which could imply potential for an accident. However, without a direct connection to the urgent situation of the patient awaiting the liver transplant, the suspense remains subdued. The reader might anticipate that the lack of warning signs could lead to a complication, but without an immediate threat or a clear link to the high-stakes scenario, the suspense is relatively mild. The paragraph serves more to characterize the setting and the cleaner's role within the hospital rather than to build suspense related to the central dramatic event.

This paragraph builds a moderate level of suspense. The detailed description of the path the men must take to deliver the liver—through the service stairwell, down a secondary corridor, and past various rooms—creates a sense of a critical mission unfolding step by step. The decision to use the stairs instead of the lift introduces a potential delay, which adds to the tension, especially given the time-sensitive nature of organ delivery. The reader is aware of the urgency and may worry that any additional time spent navigating the hospital could have serious consequences. The specific mention of the patient being on the 6th floor sets up a clear goal for the men and a physical distance they need to cover, which contributes to the suspense. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader engaged in the progress of the mission, wondering if the men will encounter any further obstacles or delays.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The sudden accident, with the man slipping and twisting his ankle, introduces an immediate and unexpected threat to the mission's success. The description of the case—containing the life-saving liver—rolling down the stairs creates a vivid and heart-stopping moment for the reader. The imagery of the case spinning and making a noise like loose keys amplifies the sense of chaos and the potential for disaster. The men's reaction, holding their breath in horror, mirrors the reader's anxiety and investment in the outcome of this critical moment. The suspense is heightened by the question of whether the organ has been damaged and whether this accident will cost the patient his life, making this paragraph a tense and pivotal point in the narrative.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense. The moment the case stops at the bottom of the stairs is a critical juncture, and the three-second pause before the men react adds to the tension. The warning from one man to the other not to touch the case because of potential damage creates a sense of dread and uncertainty. The urgency of the situation is underscored by the immediate decision to call the doctors and the careful division of tasks between the two men. The detailed description of one man's cautious descent and hurried journey through the hospital corridors to alert the medical team keeps the reader engaged and anxious about the outcome. The suspense is sustained by the question of whether the organ is still viable and the anticipation of how the medical team will respond to this emergency. The reader is left in suspense, waiting to see if the transplant can proceed despite this setback.

This paragraph sustains a high level of suspense. The injured man's internal struggle, trying not to think about the potential damage to the liver while he endures his own pain, adds emotional depth to the suspense. His superstitious belief that his suffering might somehow safeguard the organ introduces a poignant human element to the tension. The arrival of the doctors, described as rushing up the stairwell, conveys a sense of urgency and critical action. The direct request for the man to move away from the case heightens the suspense, as it suggests that the medical professionals are about to assess the situation and potentially reveal the fate of the liver—and, by extension, the patient. The reader is left on edge, waiting for the doctors' evaluation and the implications it will have for the transplant.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The focus on the simple, tactile action of the doctor opening the case creates a moment of anticipation. The description of the case's mechanism and the revelation of the "small padded fridge" inside adds to the tension, as it emphasizes the delicate nature of the contents and the care taken in their transport. The doctor's reaction, shaking his head after a brief look, is a powerful and non-verbal indication that something is wrong, which immediately raises the stakes. The detail of the fridge being ruptured with a long split and the escape of refrigerated air not only confirms the worst fears regarding the organ's condition but also symbolizes the dissipation of hope for the patient. The reader is left with a sense of impending tragedy, as the paragraph suggests that the transplant may no longer be possible due to this unfortunate turn of events.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The detailed description of the medical procedures, including the transfer of the organ to the hepatology laboratory and the subsequent examination, creates a sense of critical importance and precision. The mention of the liver's superficial condition being correct and the enzyme activity being sufficiently low offers a glimmer of hope, which serves to heighten the tension—the reader is aware that this hope is fragile and could be extinguished at any moment. The focus on the metabolic rate and the need for a biopsy underscores the delicacy of the situation. The surgeon's nervousness, despite his experience with biopsies, adds to the suspense, as it highlights the gravity of the procedure and the potential for a life-altering mistake. The surgeon's awareness that a slight error could irreparably damage the organ and cost a child's life keeps the reader on edge, fully invested in the outcome of this pivotal moment.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The surgeon's careful insertion of the needle and the relief at not encountering resistance create a tense atmosphere, as the reader is acutely aware of the potential for disaster. The detailed account of the procedure, including the collection of the transparent liquid and the preparation for analysis, maintains a high level of suspense. The surgeon's physical reactions—wiping sweat from his brow and showing signs of relief—reflect the intensity of the moment and the high stakes involved. The colleague's meticulous handling of the sample for microscopic examination adds to the tension, as does the surgeon's focused analysis and non-verbal cues, such as pursing his lips and blinking. The prolonged silence and the surgeon's eventual confirmation of the organ's deterioration deliver a devastating blow, effectively resolving the suspense with a tragic outcome. The reader's anticipation and anxiety throughout the paragraph are rewarded with a dramatic and impactful conclusion.

This paragraph, while conveying a tragic outcome, is low in suspense because it serves as a conclusive statement rather than a moment of tension or uncertainty. The reader is informed of Robert Bent's death and the reason for it—the inability to perform the liver transplant due to organ damage during transport. Since the paragraph provides a definitive resolution to the situation, the element of suspense, which relies on the anticipation of potential outcomes, is largely absent. The suspense would have been higher if the paragraph had been part of the unfolding narrative, leading up to this moment with ongoing tension and uncertainty. However, as a standalone statement, it functions more as a somber confirmation of events than a suspenseful element of the story.
