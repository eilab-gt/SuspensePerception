3. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before adds to the tension, as it suggests that the outcome is far from certain.

1. The paragraph is quite straightforward and doesn't use any particularly suspenseful language or techniques.
2. The situation is described in a relatively matter-of-fact way, which takes away from the sense of tension and uncertainty.
