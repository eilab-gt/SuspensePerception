I'd rate this paragraph a **6** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** The opening line immediately grabs attention by claiming the story is based on a real event, adding a layer of authenticity and potential gravity.
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child in critical need of a transplant. This creates immediate tension and concern for the reader.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of the wait and Robert's deteriorating condition introduces a sense of urgency and impending doom.
* **Unexpected Twist:** The final sentence reveals a shocking and unexpected outcome, leaving the reader wanting to know more about what went wrong.

**However:**

* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is quite factual and lacks vivid descriptions or emotional engagement. More sensory details and insight into Robert's condition or the team's emotions could heighten the suspense.
* **Revealing the Ending:** While the twist is effective, stating that Robert dies upfront somewhat diminishes the suspense. A more gradual reveal of the events leading to his death could be more impactful. 


Overall, the paragraph sets a suspenseful tone and piques the reader's curiosity, but it could be even more gripping with some stylistic enhancements.
