This paragraph introduces a potential element of suspense with the cleaner's routine of mopping the service stairwell and not placing "wet floor" signs at the top of each section. The mundane description of the cleaner's job and his habits set the stage for a possible accident or complication that could impact the urgent situation previously described. The contrast between the cleaner's routine and the critical events happening elsewhere in the hospital creates a sense of dramatic irony, as the reader is aware of the high stakes involved in the liver delivery while the cleaner is not.

However, the suspense is relatively mild because there is no direct threat or immediate danger presented in this paragraph. The potential for an incident is implied but not explicitly connected to the ongoing crisis with Robert and the liver transplant. The suspensefulness of this paragraph is more about the anticipation of a potential problem rather than a clear and present danger, which is why it ranks lower on the scale.
