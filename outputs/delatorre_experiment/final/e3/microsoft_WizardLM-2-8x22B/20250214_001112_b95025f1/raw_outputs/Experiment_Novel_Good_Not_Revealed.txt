This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—and emphasizing punctuality, which suggests that every second counts. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" creates a balance between hope and the potential for disaster, maintaining tension. The specificity of the time and the action of landing on the hospital roof contributes to a sense of immediacy. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the punctuality and stability mentioned, which may imply that things are going according to plan, thus reducing the sense of imminent danger or unpredictability.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the urgency of the situation with the helicopter still running, the men quickly exiting, and the critical nature of their cargo—a human liver being kept at a precise temperature for transplant. The detail that the men are communicating non-verbally due to the noise of the helicopter, using gestures to convey the urgency of the situation, adds to the tension. The focus on the blue case and the careful handling of the organ underscore the high stakes of the operation. The mention that the patient is in a critical situation and that there is no time to lose emphasizes the life-or-death urgency, which is a key element in building suspense.

This paragraph contains elements that contribute to a sense of foreboding, which is a component of suspense, but it is not as immediately suspenseful as the previous ones. The detailed description of the cleaner's routine and his preference for the more social environment of the corridors sets a contrast with the solitude and monotony of the service stairwell. The lack of windows and the sparse decoration create an atmosphere that could be ripe for an unexpected event. The cleaner's habit of not placing "wet floor" signs could potentially lead to an accident, which adds a layer of tension. However, the paragraph lacks a direct connection to the urgent situation of Robert Bent and the liver transplant, and the pacing is slower, focusing more on character and setting than on immediate action or danger. The suspense here is more subtle and anticipatory, as the reader might sense that the cleaner's actions could have unforeseen consequences, especially given the critical nature of the events happening simultaneously in the hospital.

This paragraph builds suspense by detailing the path the men must take to deliver the liver to the patient, highlighting the urgency of their mission. The specificity of the route—through the service stairwell, past the central archives and storeroom, and the mention of the doctors' rooms and the east wing lift—creates a vivid mental image for the reader, who can anticipate the potential for obstacles or delays. The decision to use the stairs instead of waiting for the lift introduces a sense of immediacy and a strategic choice that could have consequences for the mission's success. The reader is likely to feel tension as the characters navigate through the hospital's less-traveled areas, aware that any delay could be critical.
