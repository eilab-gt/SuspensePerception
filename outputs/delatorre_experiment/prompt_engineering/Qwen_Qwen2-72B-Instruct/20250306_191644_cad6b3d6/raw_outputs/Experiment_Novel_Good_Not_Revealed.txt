The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear sense of urgency and uncertainty. The mention of a real event adds to the tension, as does the critical condition of the patient and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait for the transplant. Therefore, I would rate it a 7 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it continues the story of the liver transplant and the critical condition of the patient. The mention of the helicopter landing punctually adds a sense of urgency and tension, but the fact that the patient is in a critical but stable condition may lessen the suspense slightly. Therefore, I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. However, the rating could be higher if the previous paragraph had established a higher level of suspense or if the reader is particularly invested in the outcome of the story.
