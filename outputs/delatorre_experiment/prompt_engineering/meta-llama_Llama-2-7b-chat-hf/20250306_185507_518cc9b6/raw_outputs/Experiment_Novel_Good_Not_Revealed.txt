  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The use of phrases such as "imminent liver transplant," "suitable donor had been found," and "critical situation" create a sense of urgency and tension, which keeps the reader engaged and curious about what will happen next. The fact that the story is based on a real event adds an extra layer of intrigue, as the reader is aware that the outcome is not known. However, the paragraph does not provide any concrete details or clues that would make it an 8 or 9 on the suspensefulness scale.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The use of the word "punctually" to describe the helicopter's landing creates a sense of precision and timing, which adds to the tension and anticipation of the situation. The fact that Robert is in a critical but stable condition also adds to the suspense, as the reader is aware that his situation could quickly change. However, the paragraph does not provide any new information or clues that would make it more suspenseful, and the overall impact is somewhat muted due to the lack of context and build-up.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The use of vivid and dramatic language, such as "whilst the rotors were still turning," "blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades," "compatible liver," and "critical situation" creates a sense of urgency and tension. The actions of the two men, including the one who shouted something inaudible and the other who nodded and moved towards the exit, add to the suspense as they suggest that something important and time-sensitive is happening. The fact that they were told the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The paragraph also ends with a cliffhanger, as the man carrying the case moves towards the exit, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next. Overall, the paragraph is very suspenseful and effectively builds tension and anticipation.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some interesting details about the cleaner's job and the hospital's layout, it does not create a sense of tension or anticipation that would make it more suspenseful. The paragraph is relatively straightforward and lacks any major plot twists or cliffhangers that would keep the reader engaged. The only mildly suspenseful element is the fact that the service stairwell is not dirty and the cleaner does not need to use the signs to warn of a wet floor, but this is not enough to elevate the paragraph to a higher level of suspensefulness. Overall, the paragraph is relatively uneventful and does not create a sense of urgency or tension that would make it more suspenseful.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The use of specific details, such as the metal ramp and the different rooms located on the secondary corridor, creates a sense of atmosphere and immersion in the story. The dialogue between the two men also adds to the suspense, as they discuss the best way to reach the 6th floor and the potential risks of taking the lift. The fact that the patient is on the 6th floor and that they need to get there quickly adds to the urgency of the situation, making it more suspenseful. However, the paragraph does not provide any major plot twists or cliffhangers, which keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the case rolling down the stairs, creates a vivid and intense atmosphere. The sudden twist of the man's ankle and the loss of the case add to the tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The comparison of the sound of the case rolling to a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag adds to the sense of chaos and unpredictability, heightening the suspense. The paragraph also ends on a cliffhanger, with the reader wondering if the man will be able to recover his balance and retrieve the case, adding to the overall suspensefulness of the passage.

  I would rate this paragraph as an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The use of specific details, such as the time it takes for the case to reach the bottom of the stairs and the tension between the two men, creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty. The fact that the case has been damaged and the medical team needs to be alerted adds to the stakes and raises the question of what will happen to the patient. The paragraph also ends on a cliffhanger, with the first man setting off to alert the medical team, leaving the second man to watch the case and creating a sense of anticipation for what will happen next. The only thing that keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 is that the suspense is not quite as intense as it could be, as the situation is not life-or-death and the stakes are not as high as they could be.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 10 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The use of specific and vivid details, such as the transfer of the interior polyurethane bag to the hepatology laboratory, the appearance of the liver, and the importance of the metabolic rate, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The paragraph also uses sensory details, such as the medical team moving back to give the surgeon space to work, to add to the overall suspensefulness of the passage. The surgeon's nervousness and the high stakes of the biopsy, with the potential to irreparably damage the organ if he is one millimetre off, make the situation even more suspenseful. The use of phrases such as "everything depended on the metabolic rate" and "if he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the paragraph extremely suspenseful.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

The fact that the surgeon is relieved to not encounter any resistance and that the metabolic rate gives cause for optimism adds to the suspense, as the reader wonders what the outcome of the biopsy will be. The use of sensory details, such as the surgeon wiping the sweat from his brow and looking down the tube, adds to the overall suspensefulness of the passage. The paragraph also ends on a cliffhanger, with the surgeon looking concerned at his colleagues and the reader wondering what the diagnosis will be, making it extremely suspenseful.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide a resolution to the suspense that has been building throughout the story, it does so in a relatively straightforward and predictable manner. The use of a specific time (21:26) and the statement that the liver is functioning correctly and has not been affected by the damage it sustained in transit, creates a sense of closure and resolution, but does not create a sense of tension or uncertainty that would make the paragraph more suspenseful. The paragraph does not raise any new questions or possibilities, and does not provide any unexpected twists or turns, which are key elements of suspenseful writing.
