 I would rate the suspensefulness of this paragraph as a 7 out of 9. While the paragraph does provide some suspenseful elements, such as the critical condition of the young patient and the race against time for the transplant, it also reveals the successful outcome of the procedure in the first sentence, which reduces some of the suspense. Additionally, the paragraph is more focused on providing background information and context rather than building tension and anticipation. However, the uncertainty around whether the patient will survive the wait and the verification of the transplant's success do contribute to the suspenseful tone of the story.
