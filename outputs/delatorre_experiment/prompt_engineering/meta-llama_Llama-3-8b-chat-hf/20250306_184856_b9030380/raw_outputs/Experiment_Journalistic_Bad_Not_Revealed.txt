I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the urgency of the situation and the critical condition of the patient, Robert Bent. The mention of the liver transplant and the waiting for the donor organ creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert survive the wait?" and "What will happen if the donor organ doesn't arrive on time?" However, the paragraph is more informative and setting up the story than it is actively building suspense, which is why I wouldn't rate it a 9.

The phrase "critical but stable condition" implies that Robert's situation is still precarious, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of a specific time, 08:57, adds to the sense of realism and urgency, making the reader feel like they are experiencing the event in real-time. However, the paragraph is still relatively brief and doesn't have any major plot twists or surprises, which is why I wouldn't rate it a 9.
