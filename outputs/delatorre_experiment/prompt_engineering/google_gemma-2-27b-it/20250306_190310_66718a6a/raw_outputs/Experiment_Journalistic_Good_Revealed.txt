I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and needs the transplant to survive. This creates some tension.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The wait for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential problems:** The mention of the liver being damaged in transit raises the possibility of complications.

However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right at the end. This removes a lot of the suspense that could have been built up.
* **The tone is factual and detached:** The writing style is more informative than gripping.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader wondering about Robert's fate until later in the story.
