**However:**

* **Lack of immediate action:** The paragraph mostly sets the scene and doesn't plunge the reader into a moment of immediate danger or conflict.
* **Predictability:** The reader anticipates that something will happen, but the paragraph doesn't offer any specific hints about the nature of the suspenseful event.


Overall, the paragraph effectively establishes a suspenseful context, but it could be made more gripping by introducing a more immediate threat or a hint of the challenges to come.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Punctuality:** The emphasis on the helicopter landing "punctually" creates a slight sense of anticipation. We know the organ is crucial, so its timely arrival is important.
