I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **High Stakes**: The situation involves a life-or-death scenario for an eight-year-old boy, which inherently creates tension.  
- **Uncertainty**: The paragraph emphasizes that Robert’s survival is uncertain, and the arrival of the organ is pending, which adds to the suspense.  
- **Immediacy**: The timeline is specific (24 February 2008) and the urgency is clear, making the situation feel real and pressing.  

However, the suspense could be heightened further with more vivid details about Robert’s condition, the challenges of the transplant, or the potential consequences of delay. Overall, it’s a strong setup but leaves room for deeper emotional engagement.
