The paragraph presents a scenario with inherent tension due to the critical condition of a young patient awaiting a life-saving transplant. The specific details about the timing and the gravity of Robert Bent's situation contribute to a sense of urgency. However, the suspense is somewhat undercut by the revelation of the outcome in the same paragraph, which informs the reader that Robert did not survive. The suspensefulness is thus moderated by the knowledge of the ultimate result, despite the dramatic buildup. The reader is left to wonder about the details of what transpired, which maintains some level of suspense regarding the story's unfolding.

This paragraph introduces a seemingly mundane aspect of the hospital setting and the routine of a cleaner. While it provides context and builds the world in which the story is set, the suspense factor is relatively low compared to the previous paragraphs that dealt directly with the urgent medical situation. The cleaner's routine, while detailed, does not immediately contribute to the tension surrounding Robert Bent's transplant. The lack of "wet floor" signs could imply a potential hazard, which might be relevant later in the story, but as it stands, this paragraph serves more to establish setting and character rather than to build suspense. It does, however, create a sense of normalcy that contrasts with the high-stakes drama unfolding elsewhere in the hospital, which can be an effective narrative technique to set up future tension or conflict.

The reader may feel suspense building due to the critical nature of the task and the potential for unforeseen obstacles or delays. The mention of the "service stairwell" also echoes the earlier paragraph about the cleaner, which might lead the reader to anticipate a complication related to the mopped floors, thus increasing the suspense.
