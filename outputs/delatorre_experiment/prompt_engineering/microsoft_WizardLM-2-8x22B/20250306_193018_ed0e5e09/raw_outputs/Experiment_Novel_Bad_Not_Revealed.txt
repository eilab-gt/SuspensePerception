This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—just minutes before the critical surgery. The punctuality of the landing suggests a moment of relief, but the fact that Robert is described as being in a "critical but stable condition" maintains the tension. The reader is aware that despite the successful arrival of the organ, the boy's condition remains precarious, and there is still a significant procedure ahead. The specific time stamp also contributes to the suspense by highlighting the urgency of the situation. The reader is likely to be invested in the immediate next steps and the outcome of the transplant, which are yet to be revealed.

This paragraph heightens the suspense by focusing on the critical handoff of the liver and the urgency of the situation. The vivid description of the men descending from the helicopter with the organ case, the noise and chaos of the rotors still spinning, and the communication between the men all contribute to a sense of high stakes and time pressure. The specific detail about the temperature of the liver and its importance in organ viability underscores the delicacy and seriousness of the operation. The fact that the men are aware of the patient's critical condition and the need for haste adds to the tension, leaving the reader anticipating the next steps and concerned about any potential delays or complications that could arise. The suspense is further amplified by the reader's knowledge that Robert's life hangs in the balance, and the success of the transplant is not yet assured.

This paragraph introduces a potential element of suspense by highlighting the cleaner's routine and the absence of "wet floor" signs in the service stairwell, which could imply a looming risk or accident. However, the suspense is somewhat diluted by the mundane nature of the task being described and the lack of immediate connection to the critical situation of Robert Bent and the liver transplant. The reader may sense a dissonance between the urgency of the medical situation and the everyday routine of the cleaner, which could hint at a future complication. The detailed description of the cleaner's work and his preference for the corridors over the stairwell sets the scene and provides character background, but it doesn't directly escalate the tension related to the main storyline. The suspense here is more subtle and relies on the reader's anticipation of potential consequences stemming from the cleaner's actions (or inactions), rather than a direct contribution to the immediate drama of the transplant operation.

This paragraph introduces a logistical decision that could have implications for the urgency of the situation, creating a moderate level of suspense.

The detailed description of the path from the helipad to the patient's location adds to the sense of urgency and the potential for unforeseen delays or complications. The reader is aware of the importance of speed in this scenario, and any suggestion of a slower route or potential obstacles can heighten tension. The fact that the men are carrying a life-saving organ and must navigate through a less-traveled part of the hospital (the service stairwell and secondary corridors) adds layers of risk and uncertainty to the situation. The suspense here is derived from the reader's anticipation of potential unforeseen events that could hinder the timely delivery of the organ.
