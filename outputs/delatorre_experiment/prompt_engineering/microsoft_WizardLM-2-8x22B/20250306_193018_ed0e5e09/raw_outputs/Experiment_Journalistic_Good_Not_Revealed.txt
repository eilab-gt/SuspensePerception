This paragraph adds to the suspense by providing a critical update on the storyline: the arrival of the helicopter carrying the life-saving organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of precision and urgency. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the situation is still precarious, maintaining tension. The reader is likely to be invested in the immediate events following this moment, such as the transfer of the organ and the commencement of the transplant surgery. While the arrival of the organ is a positive development, the use of "but stable" in describing Robert's condition implies that there is still potential for complications, which keeps the suspense level high.

This paragraph continues to build suspense by detailing the arrival of the men carrying the organ, with the focus on the "small blue fridge" that contains the liver. The specific description of the fridge as being "in the shape of a case" and the mention that it stores a "fully functioning liver" adds a tangible element to the narrative, making the situation more vivid and the stakes more real. The reader is likely to be curious about the condition of the liver upon arrival and whether it will be viable for transplant, as well as the potential for any unforeseen events during the handover process. While the suspense is not as high as in the previous paragraphs that dealt with the immediate life-threatening situation of the boy, the careful handling of the organ and the importance of what it represents maintain a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph introduces a new element of potential risk that could impact the unfolding storyline. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and leaving without placing a "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it suggests the possibility of an accident occurring in the service stairwell. This detail adds a layer of suspense because readers can anticipate the potential consequences of a slippery floor in a high-stakes environment where the medical team is rushing to save a life. The timing is also critical, as it happened "minutes earlier," which could mean that the medical team or the men carrying the organ might soon encounter this hazard. The suspense here is more subtle and situational, rather than directly related to the life-or-death scenario of the boy's transplant, but it still contributes to the overall tension of the narrative.

This paragraph raises the suspense level by directly connecting the men transporting the life-saving liver with the potential hazard introduced in the previous paragraph. The decision to use the service stairwell, which has recently been mopped and lacks a "wet floor" sign, introduces an immediate risk. The reader is likely to be concerned about the safety of the men and, more critically, the safety of the organ they are carrying. The suspense arises from the anticipation of a potential accident that could jeopardize the transplant and Robert's chances of survival. The specific choice of the stairwell as a setting adds to the tension, as stairways are often associated with falls and accidents. The narrative has effectively set up a situation where the reader is aware of the danger that the characters are unknowingly walking into, which heightens the sense of suspense.

The slip of the man carrying the case with the liver, and the subsequent tumbling of the case down the stairs, represents a critical turning point in the story.

The vivid description of the case "plunging" down the stairs adds a sense of urgency and disaster. The reader is left in suspense regarding the condition of the liver after the fall, the well-being of the men involved, and the implications for Robert's surgery. This moment is charged with tension and uncertainty, making it a highly suspenseful development in the narrative.

The fact that the case is left unhandled until the doctors arrive creates a sense of tension, as the reader is left to wonder about the state of the liver inside. The suspense is amplified by the uncertainty surrounding the viability of the organ after the fall and the impact this will have on Robert's transplant. The focus on the case being supervised but not opened adds to the anticipation, as the reader is kept in suspense about whether the liver can still be used.

The reader is aware of the potential crisis involving the liver and the critical nature of the transplant surgery, so the swift arrival of the medical team is a crucial moment in the narrative.

The mention of the doctors taking the case to the hepatic laboratory for a biopsy by the responsible surgeon indicates a meticulous and urgent response to the ruptured bag. The reader is kept in suspense regarding the outcome of the biopsy and the condition of the liver after the fall and the rupture. The focus on the medical team's actions and the technical process of the biopsy adds to the tension, as it suggests the complexity and seriousness of the situation.

This paragraph provides a moment of relief and resolution to the immediate suspense by revealing that the liver has withstood the impact and is viable for transplant. The tension surrounding the condition of the liver is resolved positively, which reduces the suspense level compared to the previous paragraphs where the outcome was uncertain. However, the use of the word "possible" introduces a note of caution, suggesting that while the liver can be used, there may still be risks or complications ahead. The reader's attention is likely to shift from the immediate viability of the organ to the upcoming transplant surgery and its potential challenges. The suspense is now more focused on the procedure itself and the recovery process, rather than the immediate threat to the liver's usability. This paragraph serves as a transition point in the narrative, where the initial crisis has been averted, but the overall outcome remains to be seen.

This paragraph concludes the immediate suspense of the storyline by confirming that Robert Bent's transplanted liver is functioning correctly and has not been affected by the earlier damage sustained in transit. The specificity of the time (21:26) adds a sense of closure to the day's events, indicating that the medical team has successfully navigated the crisis. The positive outcome for Robert's liver function is a significant moment of resolution, which naturally reduces the suspense level. However, the reader may still harbor some residual concern for Robert's recovery process and any potential long-term effects, which keeps the narrative from reaching a complete lack of tension. The paragraph serves as a satisfying conclusion to the critical events surrounding the transplant, but it also opens the door to future developments in Robert's journey to full health, which could introduce new elements of suspense.
