The paragraph presents a scenario with inherent tension due to the life-or-death circumstances surrounding Robert Bent's liver transplant. The specific details such as the date, the boy's name, and the time of his death add a sense of realism and gravity to the situation. The mention of a suitable donor followed by the uncertainty of whether Robert would survive long enough for the transplant, and the ultimate tragic outcome, all contribute to a feeling of suspense. However, since the paragraph concludes with the boy's death without the transplant occurring, it resolves the primary tension point, which might reduce the suspense score for some readers who were anticipating a different kind of resolution or further development of the story. The suspense is thus contained within the wait for the transplant and the uncertainty of the outcome, which is why it rates in the middle range of the scale.

This paragraph introduces a moment of heightened tension and anticipation in the story. The precise timing and the punctuality of the helicopter landing suggest a critical juncture in the narrative, where every second counts. The mention of the organ's arrival by helicopter adds a dynamic element to the scene, and the reader is likely to be aware of the urgency and the high stakes involved in the successful delivery of the organ. The phrase "critical but stable condition" indicates that Robert Bent's situation is still precarious, which contributes to the suspense. The reader is left wondering whether the organ will be viable, whether the transplant will proceed without complications, and whether Robert will survive, given his delicate state. This paragraph effectively sets up a scenario that is ripe with suspense regarding the immediate future of the characters involved.

This paragraph adds a layer of suspense through the vivid imagery of the men descending from the helicopter with the small blue fridge containing the liver. The specificity of the "small blue fridge, in the shape of a case," creates a clear visual for the reader and emphasizes the precious cargo it holds. The fact that the liver is described as "fully functioning" suggests hope for Robert Bent's transplant, but the careful handling and transportation of the organ also imply the delicacy and potential for complications. The reader is likely to be invested in the safe delivery and condition of the liver upon arrival, as well as the immediate next steps in the transplant process. While the paragraph does not contain direct conflict or immediate danger, it effectively builds suspense by focusing on the critical element that could determine the outcome of the story.

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could have significant consequences for the storyline, creating a sense of suspense. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and failing to display a "wet floor" sign sets up a scenario where an accident could occur, especially considering the urgency and high stakes of the situation with the liver transplant. The reader is likely to anticipate a possible complication, such as a slip or fall, which could jeopardize the delivery of the organ or the well-being of the characters involved. The timing of this detail, "minutes earlier," adds to the tension by suggesting that the characters are unknowingly walking into a potentially dangerous situation. While the paragraph does not present immediate peril, it effectively builds suspense by hinting at an unnoticed risk that could impact the unfolding events.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level, as it directly connects the critical action of the story (transporting the liver) with the potential hazard that was previously introduced (the wet floor in the service stairwell). The decision of the two men to use the service stairwell, presumably unaware of the wet floor, creates an immediate sense of danger and anticipation. The reader is likely to be concerned about the safety of the men and, more importantly, the integrity of the liver they are transporting. The focus on their choice of route heightens the tension because it suggests that an accident could be imminent, potentially impacting the success of Robert Bent's transplant. The suspense here is high because the reader can foresee a risk that the characters are currently unaware of, creating a sense of dramatic irony and a compelling need to find out what happens next.

This paragraph reaches the highest level of suspense on the scale. It presents a direct and immediate consequence of the previously established hazard (the wet floor in the service stairwell). The description of the man slipping and the case with the liver plunging down the stairs creates a critical moment of action with severe implications for the storyline. The reader is likely to feel a peak of tension due to the potential disaster that could result from this accident—the damage to the liver, which could mean the loss of the only available organ for transplant and the life of Robert Bent hanging in the balance. The vivid and dramatic nature of the event, combined with its impact on the central conflict of the story, makes this paragraph very suspenseful, leaving the reader eager to discover the outcome of this pivotal incident.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense, as it continues to build on the immediate aftermath of the accident in the service stairwell. The quick response of the man's colleague to warn the doctors adds to the urgency of the situation, while the other man's decision to stay with the case and ensure it is not mishandled further emphasizes the importance of the liver's condition. The instruction that the case was "not handled in any way" until the doctors arrived suggests that there is still hope for the liver to be intact and usable, but the suspense remains high due to the uncertainty of its condition after the fall. The reader is likely to be highly invested in the outcome, wondering whether the doctors will be able to salvage the situation and whether Robert Bent's transplant will proceed as planned. The tension is sustained by the need for immediate medical assessment and the potential consequences should the liver be damaged.

This paragraph contributes to the suspense by highlighting the prompt response of the doctors to the emergency, which is crucial given the time-sensitive nature of organ transplants. The reader is likely to be relieved by the timely arrival of the medical team, as it suggests that every effort is being made to address the situation quickly and potentially save the liver for transplant. However, the brevity and lack of detail in the paragraph also serve to heighten the suspense because it leaves the reader in suspense about the condition of the liver and the fate of Robert Bent. The swift action sets the stage for a critical assessment and decision-making process, which are pivotal moments in the story. The reader is left anticipating the doctors' evaluation of the liver and whether their promptness will be enough to avert disaster, thus maintaining a high level of suspense.

This paragraph reaches a peak of suspense because it reveals a significant complication that directly affects the central tension of the story. The revelation that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured introduces a critical setback that could potentially jeopardize the entire transplant procedure. The reader is likely to feel a surge of tension upon learning of this development, as it raises the stakes and introduces new questions about the viability of the liver and the subsequent actions of the medical team. The suspense is heightened by the implications of this discovery: the potential for organ contamination, the urgency to find an alternative solution, and the impact on Robert Bent's chances of survival. The paragraph leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, desperate to know how the doctors will respond to this unexpected and dire situation.

This paragraph sustains a high level of suspense as it describes the immediate and critical response to the ruptured bag containing the liver. The action of taking the case to the hepatic laboratory for a biopsy indicates that the medical team is actively working to assess the organ's viability, which is a matter of life and death for Robert Bent. The mention of a surgeon responsible for the transplant carrying out the biopsy adds a sense of gravitas and expertise to the situation, suggesting that every possible measure is being taken to salvage the organ. The reader is likely to be highly engaged, waiting anxiously for the results of the biopsy, which will determine the next steps in the story. The suspense is rooted in the uncertainty of the liver's condition and the anticipation of whether or not the transplant can proceed, keeping the tension high as the narrative unfolds.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful as it delivers a critical and negative turning point in the story. The analysis revealing that the liver has not withstood the impact and cannot be used for the transplant is a devastating blow that significantly raises the stakes and emotional tension. The reader is likely to feel a profound sense of urgency and concern for Robert Bent's fate, as this development means that the last hope for his transplant has been extinguished. The paragraph leaves the reader with a cliffhanger, as it is unclear how the characters will respond to this dire news or what alternatives, if any, might be available. The suspense is at its peak because the narrative has reached a moment of crisis, and the reader is left to wonder about the possible solutions and the ultimate outcome for Robert.

This paragraph brings a sense of resolution to the central tension of the story, which inherently reduces the suspense level. The confirmation of Robert Bent's death, due to the inability to perform the liver transplant because of the organ's damage, provides closure to the immediate narrative arc. While the outcome is tragic and the paragraph is emotionally impactful, the suspense primarily lies in the anticipation of how the characters will cope with this loss and what the aftermath will entail. The reader may still have questions about the consequences of this event and the future of the medical team involved, but the main source of suspense—Robert Bent's fate—has been determined. Therefore, while the paragraph is poignant and significant, it rates lower on the suspense scale because the central tension has been resolved.
