This paragraph contributes minimal suspense to the storyline. It provides background information about the cleaner's routine and his experience while cleaning the service stairwell, which, while it sets the scene and offers character insight, does not directly escalate the tension or conflict related to Robert Bent's critical situation. The mundane nature of the cleaner's job and his habitual actions contrast with the high-stakes drama unfolding elsewhere in the hospital. The detail about the absence of "wet floor" signs could imply a potential hazard, which might introduce a slight element of suspense, but without a direct connection to the main plotline, the suspense level remains low. The reader may anticipate that this detail could become relevant later, but as it stands, the paragraph is more about setting than advancing the suspenseful elements of the story.
