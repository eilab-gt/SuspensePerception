I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The situation is immediately presented as high-stakes: a child's life hangs in the balance, and time is of the essence.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of "awaiting the arrival of the organ" and the fact that Robert's situation is "critical" creates a sense of urgency and a ticking clock.
* **Uncertainty:** The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" introduces a significant element of uncertainty, leaving the reader wondering if the transplant will be successful.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:**  While the situation is dire, there isn't an immediate, tangible threat presented in the paragraph. We don't see Robert in pain or experiencing a sudden crisis. This prevents it from reaching a higher level of suspense.


Overall, the paragraph effectively sets the stage for a suspenseful story, but it relies more on the implied threat and the ticking clock than on immediate action or danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Tension:** The precise time and the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ directly address the ticking clock established in the previous paragraph. This creates a sense of heightened tension and anticipation.
* **Limited Information:**  We know the organ has arrived, but we don't know if the transplant will be successful or if any complications arise. This lack of information keeps the reader engaged and wanting to know more.

**However:**

* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** While the paragraph is factual and creates a sense of urgency, it lacks an emotional connection to Robert's situation. We don't see his reaction to the helicopter's arrival or feel his fear or hope. This prevents it from reaching a higher level of suspense.


Overall, the paragraph effectively builds on the suspense established in the previous paragraph, but it could be more impactful with a stronger emotional connection to Robert's situation.

I'd rate this paragraph an **8/9** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The description of the liver's delicate condition ("fully functioning," "four degrees centigrade") emphasizes the high stakes and the fragility of the situation.
* **Visual Detail:** The vivid imagery of the men battling the wind and the urgency of their movements creates a sense of immediacy and tension.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of the watch and the need to hurry reinforces the sense of urgency and the pressure on the men to act quickly.
* **Unanswered Questions:** We don't know if they will make it in time, if there will be complications, or what the "critical situation" entails. This leaves the reader on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what happens next.

**What elevates it:**

The paragraph masterfully combines visual detail, a ticking clock, and a sense of urgency to create a gripping and suspenseful scene. The focus on the physical journey of the liver, coupled with the knowledge of Robert's critical condition, keeps the reader invested and anxious for the outcome.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2/9** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph focuses on a mundane, uneventful task. There's no immediate threat, danger, or mystery.
* **Descriptive Focus:** The writing is primarily descriptive, detailing the cleaner's routine and the environment. This lacks the elements that typically drive suspense, such as rising action, foreshadowing, or a sense of impending doom.
* **Unrelated to Main Plot:** The paragraph seems disconnected from the main storyline involving Robert's transplant. There's no clear link or indication of how the cleaner's actions might impact the events unfolding with the organ.

**Overall:**

This paragraph serves as a brief, descriptive interlude but does little to build suspense or engage the reader in anticipation of what might happen next.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7/9** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The emphasis on the urgency of the situation ("It's not worth taking the lift," "it'll have taken longer")  increases the tension.  Every second counts for Robert.
* **Decision Point:** The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the lift creates a moment of suspense. Will this be the right choice? Could there be unforeseen obstacles on the stairs?
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the exact condition of Robert or how long it will take them to reach him. This lack of information keeps the reader guessing and invested in the outcome.
* **Building Tension:** The description of the service stairwell ("no windows," "dull walls") adds a sense of claustrophobia and isolation, further heightening the tension.

**What elevates it:**

The paragraph effectively builds on the previous scene's urgency by introducing a decision point and emphasizing the time constraints. The setting and the men's dialogue contribute to a growing sense of anticipation and concern for Robert's well-being.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Relief and Uncertainty:** The paragraph starts with a sense of relief that the case has stopped, but it's quickly followed by uncertainty about the potential damage. This creates a mixed emotional response, keeping the reader on edge.

**What holds it back:**
