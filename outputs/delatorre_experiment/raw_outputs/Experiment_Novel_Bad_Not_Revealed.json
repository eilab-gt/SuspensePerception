"Here are my ratings of the suspense level of each paragraph:\n\n1. Not suspenseful (1/9) - This paragraph is more of an introduction to the story, setting the scene and establishing the context. It's a straightforward and factual account of the event.\n\n2. Slightly suspenseful (3/9) - This paragraph introduces the helicopter and the organ, creating a sense of anticipation and expectation. However, it's still a relatively calm and matter-of-fact description of events.\n\n3. Moderately suspenseful (5/9) - This paragraph starts to build tension as the two men rush to deliver the organ. The noise of the helicopter and the urgency of their mission create a sense of urgency, but it's still a relatively controlled environment.\n\n4. Not suspenseful (1/9) - This paragraph is a slow and mundane description of the cleaner's routine. It's a nice contrast to the previous paragraphs, but it doesn't contribute much to the overall suspense.\n\n5"
