"Here are my ratings of the suspense level of each paragraph:\n\n1. **2/9**: This paragraph is more of an introduction and sets the scene for the story. It's not very suspenseful.\n\n2. **4/9**: This paragraph is more exciting as it introduces the helicopter and the organ being transported, but it's still a relatively straightforward scene.\n\n3. **5/9**: This paragraph starts to build tension as the two men are in a hurry and the noise of the helicopter blades makes it difficult to communicate. The reader starts to sense that something might go wrong.\n\n4. **3/9**: This paragraph is more of a break from the tension and focuses on the daily life of the cleaner. It's not very suspenseful.\n\n5. **6/9**: This paragraph starts to build tension again as the two men are discussing the best way to get to the patient's floor. The reader starts to feel a sense of urgency.\n\n6. **8/9**:"
