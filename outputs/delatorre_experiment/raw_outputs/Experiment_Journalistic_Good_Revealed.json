"Here are my ratings of the suspense level of each paragraph:\n\n1. Suspense level: 2\nThis paragraph is more of an introduction to the story, and it doesn't create any tension or suspense. It simply sets the scene and provides some background information.\n\n2. Suspense level: 1\nThis paragraph is also quite straightforward and doesn't create any tension. It simply states a fact about the helicopter arriving on time.\n\n3. Suspense level: 1\nThis paragraph is more of a description of the scene, and it doesn't create any tension or suspense. It's a fairly mundane scene.\n\n4. Suspense level: 1\nThis paragraph is also quite straightforward and doesn't create any tension. It simply states a fact about the cleaner finishing their job.\n\n5. Suspense level: 2\nThis paragraph starts to create a sense of tension, as the two men are making a decision that might have consequences. However, it's not a particularly suspenseful moment"
