"Here are my ratings of the preceding paragraph's suspensefulness:\n\n1. 3 - The first paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's a relatively calm and straightforward introduction to the event. There's no immediate sense of tension or danger.\n\n2. 2 - The second paragraph simply confirms that the organ has arrived, which is a relief, but not particularly suspenseful.\n\n3. 2 - The third paragraph shows the organ being transported, but it's a fairly mundane and ordinary scene.\n\n4. 5 - The fourth paragraph introduces a potential problem - the floor is wet and a cleaner has just finished mopping - but it's not entirely clear what will happen next.\n\n5. 8 - The fifth paragraph shows the liver being transported down the stairs, and the risk of an accident becomes more apparent. The reader is starting to wonder if something will go wrong.\n\n6. 9 - The sixth paragraph is where the plot really takes a turn for the worse. The liver slips"
