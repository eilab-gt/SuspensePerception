"Here are my ratings of the preceding paragraph's suspense level:\n\n1. 3 - The first paragraph sets the scene and provides some background information, but it's a fairly straightforward and calm introduction to the story.\n\n2. 2 - The second paragraph is still relatively calm and tells us about a routine event (a helicopter landing).\n\n3. 2 - The third paragraph is also quite calm and describes the two men descending from the helicopter with a liver in a case.\n\n4. 4 - The fourth paragraph introduces a hint of danger with the cleaner not putting up a \"wet floor\" sign, but it's still not very suspenseful.\n\n5. 6 - The fifth paragraph is where things start to get more suspenseful, as the two men walking down the stairs creates a sense of potential danger.\n\n6. 8 - The sixth paragraph is quite suspenseful, as the man carrying the case slips and the case plunges down the stairs.\n\n7. 5 - The seventh paragraph"
