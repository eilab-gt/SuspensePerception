"Here are the suspense ratings for each paragraph:\n\n**Paragraph 1: 3/9**\nThis paragraph is a straightforward introduction to the story and sets the stage for the events that will unfold. It doesn't create much suspense, but it does hint at the seriousness of Robert's situation and the importance of the transplant.\n\n**Paragraph 2: 2/9**\nThis paragraph continues to set the scene, describing the arrival of the helicopter and the organ. It's a relatively calm and routine scene, and the suspense level remains low.\n\n**Paragraph 3: 4/9**\nThis paragraph introduces some tension as the two men rush to deliver the organ, but the scene is still relatively calm and the reader is not yet aware of the impending disaster.\n\n**Paragraph 4: 1/9**\nThis paragraph is a non-essential interlude that introduces the cleaner and his mundane work. It's a relatively boring and non-suspenseful paragraph that doesn't add much to the plot"
