I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph a 4. The paragraph sets up a dramatic scenario, introducing a critical situation with a child's life at risk, but the outcome is already revealed in the first sentence, which reduces the suspense. The paragraph builds up to the climax, but the reader already knows that the transplant didn't happen, so the tension is somewhat alleviated. The sentence "This is the story of what happened" also feels more like a introduction to the story rather than a cliffhanger, which further reduces the suspense.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph a 6. The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and importance with the helicopter landing on the roof, and the mention of Robert's critical condition raises the stakes. However, the fact that Robert is "stable" somewhat reduces the tension, and the sentence feels more like a setup for what's to come rather than a cliffhanger.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph an 8. This paragraph introduces a new element that raises questions and creates tension. The fact that the cleaner didn't display the "wet floor" sign implies that something might go wrong, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph a 9. This paragraph is very suspenseful because it sets up a clear danger scenario: the two men carrying the liver are about to walk down a stairwell with a wet floor, which was previously mentioned. The reader is expecting an accident to happen, and the tension builds up as the men take the stairwell. The use of the word "decided" also implies a sense of inevitability, making the situation feel more ominous.
