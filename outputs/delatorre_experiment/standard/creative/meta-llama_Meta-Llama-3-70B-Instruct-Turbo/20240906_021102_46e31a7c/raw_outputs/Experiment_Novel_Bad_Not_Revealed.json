Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 4 - The introduction sets the scene and provides some context, but it's mostly a calm and informative paragraph.

2. 2 - The helicopter landing is a dramatic event, but it's a fairly routine part of the story so far, and there's no sense of danger or tension.

3. 3 - The description of the men descending from the helicopter and rushing to deliver the liver is a bit more urgent, but it's still a relatively calm and procedural scene.

4. 1 - The cleaner's routine is described in a very matter-of-fact way, and there's no sense of danger or tension.

5. 2 - The description of the hospital's layout and the men's decision to take the stairs is fairly calm, but there's a hint of urgency due to the critical condition of the patient.

6. 8 - This is where the suspense starts to ramp up! The man's foot slipping and the liver case rolling down the stairs is a dramatic and intense moment.

7. 9 - The two men's reactions to the case reaching the bottom of the stairs are filled with tension and suspense, and the reader is left wondering if the liver is damaged.

8. 8 - The man's fear and superstition add to the suspense, and the reader is still wondering about the condition of the liver.

9. 9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the reveal of the damaged liver is a very suspenseful moment.

10. 6 - The medical team's efforts to examine the liver and determine its condition are still suspenseful, but the pace of the story slows down a bit.

11. 8 - The surgeon's nervousness and the risk of damaging the liver add to the suspense, and the reader is on edge waiting for the outcome.

12. 1 - The final paragraph is more of a resolution than a suspenseful moment, as the reader already knows the worst has happened.
