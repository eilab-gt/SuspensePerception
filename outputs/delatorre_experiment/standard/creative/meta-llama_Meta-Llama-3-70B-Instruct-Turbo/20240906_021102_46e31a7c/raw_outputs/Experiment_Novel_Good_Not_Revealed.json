I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale, where 1 is "not suspenseful" and 9 is "very suspenseful".

Paragraph 1: 4
The first paragraph sets the scene and establishes the situation, but it doesn't create much suspense. We know that something will happen, but we don't know what, and there's no sense of urgency or danger.

Paragraph 2: 2
The second paragraph is mainly descriptive and doesn't add much to the suspense. The arrival of the helicopter is a key event, but it's not particularly suspenseful in itself.

Paragraph 3: 3
The third paragraph introduces some tension as the men hurry to deliver the liver, but it's still relatively low-key. We're not yet invested in the characters or the situation, so the suspense is limited.

Paragraph 4: 1
The fourth paragraph is a calm, descriptive passage that takes us away from the main action. It's not suspenseful at all, and feels like a bit of a distraction from the main story.

Paragraph 5: 4
The fifth paragraph gets us back to the main action and introduces some tension as the men decide not to take the lift. We're starting to feel a sense of urgency as they hurry to deliver the liver.

Paragraph 6: 8
The sixth paragraph is where the suspense really kicks in. The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a dramatic and unexpected event that creates a lot of tension.

Paragraph 7: 9
The seventh paragraph is extremely suspenseful as the men wait to see if the case has been damaged. We're holding our breath along with them, wondering if the liver has been ruined.

Paragraph 8: 7
The eighth paragraph maintains the suspense as the man stays with the case, trying not to think about the worst-case scenario. We're still worried about the liver and the patient's fate.

Paragraph 9: 9
The ninth paragraph is another highly suspenseful moment as the doctor opens the case and we find out what's happened to the liver. The revelation that the fridge has ruptured is a big shock.

Paragraph 10: 5
The tenth paragraph is a bit of a breather after the suspense of the previous two paragraphs. It's still tense, but we're more focused on the medical procedure than the suspense of the situation.

Paragraph 11: 8
The
