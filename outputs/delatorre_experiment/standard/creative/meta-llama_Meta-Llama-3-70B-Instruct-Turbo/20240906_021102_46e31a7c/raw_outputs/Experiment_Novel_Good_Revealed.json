I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested. Here are my ratings:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's mostly introductory and doesn't create much suspense.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter adds some tension, but it's still a relatively routine scene.

3. 4 - The sense of urgency and criticality of the situation starts to build, and the description of the men rushing to deliver the liver creates some tension.

4. 5 - The introduction of the cleaner adds a bit of a distraction, but the description of the service stairwell and the cleaning routine doesn't create much suspense.

5. 6 - The conversation between the two men and the decision to take the stairs adds some tension, as the reader starts to wonder if they'll make it in time.

6. 8 - The slip and the fall of the case creates a lot of suspense, as the reader is worried about the liver being damaged.

7. 8 - The aftermath of the fall and the concern about the liver's condition keeps the suspense high.

8. 7 - The wait for the doctors to arrive and the uncertainty about the liver's condition maintains a high level of suspense.

9. 9 - The revelation that the fridge has ruptured and the liver may be damaged creates a lot of suspense and tension.

10. 8 - The transfer of the liver to the laboratory and the uncertainty about its condition keeps the suspense high.

11. 9 - The biopsy procedure and the surgeon's nervousness create a lot of tension and suspense.

12. 1 - The resolution of the story and the confirmation that the liver is functioning correctly brings the suspense level back down.
