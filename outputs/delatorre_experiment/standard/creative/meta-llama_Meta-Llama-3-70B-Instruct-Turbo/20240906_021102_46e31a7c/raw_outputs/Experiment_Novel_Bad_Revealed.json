I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale, where 1 is "not suspenseful" and 9 is "very suspenseful".

1. 4 - The paragraph sets the stage for a dramatic event, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. 2 - The paragraph is more of a scene-setting description, and while it's well-written, it's not particularly suspenseful.

3. 5 - The paragraph creates some tension as the characters rush to deliver the liver, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

4. 1 - This paragraph is a quiet, descriptive passage that breaks the tension built up in the previous paragraphs. It's a deliberate pace-shift, but it's not suspenseful.

5. 6 - The paragraph introduces a sense of urgency and creates tension as the characters decide not to take the lift, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

6. 8 - This paragraph is where the suspense really starts to build. The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a tense and frightening moment.

7. 7 - The paragraph continues the tension as the characters react to the case falling, but it's a brief passage and the suspense is somewhat alleviated by the fact that the case has stopped rolling.

8. 5 - The paragraph creates some tension as the character waits by the case, but it's a relatively calm passage.

9. 9 - This paragraph is very suspenseful, as the doctor opens the case and reveals the damage to the liver. The outcome is still unknown, and the tension is high.

10. 6 - The paragraph is suspenseful as the medical team examines the liver, but the outcome is still uncertain, and the tension is somewhat alleviated by the fact that they're taking steps to determine the liver's condition.

11. 8 - This paragraph is very suspenseful, as the surgeon performs the biopsy and the outcome is still unknown. The tension is high, and the stakes are clear.

12. 1 - The final paragraph is more of a resolution than a suspenseful passage. The outcome is revealed, and the tension is released.
