 9: The paragraphs leading up to the arrival of the helicopter and the arrival of the liver were quite suspenseful as the stakes were high for the young boy, Robert Bent, and the successful arrival of the liver was crucial for his survival. The arrival of the helicopter and the two men carrying the liver added to the tension and anticipation. The paragraph describing the cleaner going about his job was less suspenseful as it didn't directly relate to the main storyline but provided context to the setting of the hospital. The tension and suspense picked up again in the later paragraphs when the liver case fell down the stairs and the doctors arrived to examine it. The final paragraph where the liver was found to be functioning correctly was a relief and a satisfying conclusion to the story.
