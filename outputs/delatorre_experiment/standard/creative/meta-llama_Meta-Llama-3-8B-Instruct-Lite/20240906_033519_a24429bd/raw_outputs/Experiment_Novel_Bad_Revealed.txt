I would rate the preceding paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The story is set in a real hospital, which gives it a sense of realism, and the fact that a child's life is at stake creates tension. However, the outcome is revealed early on, which reduces the suspense. The uncertainty surrounding the child's survival and the tragic turn of events adds to the sense of tension, but it's not enough to make the entire paragraph extremely suspensful.
