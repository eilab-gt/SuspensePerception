I would rate the first paragraph as a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The story is presented as a true event, which sets a serious and somber tone, but there is no sense of urgency or danger, and the plot is already clear (the patient's transplant is unsuccessful). The focus is more on setting the scene and providing context than on creating tension or suspense.

2 The story of Robert Bent's life would eventually be published in a book by his mother, and her efforts to investigate the cause of her son's death, which led to a class-action lawsuit against the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the non-profit that matches organs for transplant. But for now, she was left to mourn her only child, and her family, and the entire medical team at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, were left to question what had happened. The medical team was met with a severe feeling of disappointment and frustration, especially the doctors and nurses who had been working so hard to save Robert's life, but who were powerless to stop the fatal outcome.
I would rate the second paragraph as a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The story is becoming more somber and tragic, and the sense of loss and disappointment is palpable. The medical team's emotions and reactions are relatable and emotional, and the hint of a possible investigation and lawsuit adds a layer of intrigue. However, the pace is still fairly slow, and the plot is largely unfolding chronologically, so the suspense is not yet high-stakes or intense.
I would rate the third paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The focus is on a critical moment in the story, and the tension is building as the reader is about to learn what happened to the organ that was supposed to save Robert's life. The use of the word "punctually" adds a sense of urgency, and the phrase "critical but stable condition" creates a sense of uncertainty, hinting that things may not have gone as planned. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the story is still unfolding, so the suspense is not yet at its peak.
I would rate the next paragraph as a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The revelation that the organ arrived, only to be rejected due to damage sustained in transit, is a shocking and devastating twist. The use of the phrase "the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant" creates a sense of irreparable loss and tragedy, and the reader is left feeling a sense of impending doom. The suspense is at its peak, as the reader is left wondering how and why things went so wrong, and what the consequences will be for the characters involved.
I would rate the previous paragraph as a 0 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The description of the two men descending from the helicopter, one of whom carrying a small blue fridge, is more of a bizarre and unusual image than a suspenseful one. The use of the phrase "in the shape of a case" is somewhat awkward and doesn't add to the tension. The paragraph is more of a curiosity-driven description, rather than a suspenseful one.
I would rate the next paragraph as a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The description of the events leading up to Robert's death is still unfolding, and the reader is still trying to piece together what happened. The use of the phrase "what happened" implies that something went wrong, and the fact that the medical team was "powerless to stop the fatal outcome" creates a sense of tragedy and loss. However, the pace is still relatively slow, and the suspense is not yet at its peak.
I would rate the previous paragraph as a 3 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The introduction of a minor character, the cleaner, and the detail about the "wet floor" sign being left out is a relatively minor plot point, and the events described are not inherently suspenseful. The phrase "minutes earlier" creates a sense of time pressure, but the event itself is not significant enough to be particularly suspenseful. The story is still unfolding, but the tension is not yet building to a climax.
I would rate the next paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The revelation that the lack of a "wet floor" sign led to the organ being damaged in transit is a critical piece of information that changes the reader's understanding of the events. The implication that a small mistake or oversight could have such severe consequences is startling, and the reader is left wondering what might have been done differently to prevent the tragedy. The suspense is building as the reader is forced to re-evaluate the events that led to Robert's death.
I would rate the previous paragraph as a 5 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The introduction of the men leaving the roof and walking down the service stairwell is a turning point in the story, and the reader is left wondering what might happen next. The fact that they chose to walk down the stairwell rather than taking the elevator creates a sense of foreboding, and the reader is left with a sense of unease. However, the pace is still relatively slow, and the tension is not yet at a peak.
I would rate the next paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The revelation that the organ was damaged in transit due to the wet floor is a significant and shocking twist, and the reader is left wondering how and why this happened. The story is now building towards a climax, and the reader is left with a sense of tension and anticipation. The events are unfolding quickly, and the reader is eager to find out what happened next.

The sudden and unexpected event of the case falling down the stairs is a thrilling and intense moment, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of the phrase "plunged down the stairs" creates a sense of urgency and danger, and the reader is on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what happens to the case and its contents. The suspense is at its peak, and the reader is fully invested in the story.
I would rate the next paragraph as a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspense.
