Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. 3/9 - This is an introductory paragraph that sets the scene for the story, so it's not very suspenseful.

2. 5/9 - This paragraph introduces the arrival of the helicopter and the medical team, which raises some questions about what's going to happen next. It's somewhat suspenseful, but not too intense.

3. 6/9 - This paragraph describes the arrival of the liver and the medical team, which creates some tension and raises the stakes. It's more suspenseful than the previous paragraphs.

4. 1/9 - This paragraph is a tangent that describes the daily routine of a hospital cleaner, which is not very suspenseful at all.

5. 4/9 - This paragraph describes the movement of the medical team and the organ, which creates some tension, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

6. 7/9 - This paragraph introduces the possibility of something going wrong, which raises the stakes. The description of the case rolling down the stairs and the men's concern creates some suspense.

7. 8/9 - This paragraph is the most suspenseful so far, as it describes the possibility of the organ being damaged and the men's concern about it. The use of words like "horror" and "shaking" creates a sense of tension.

8. 8/9 - This paragraph describes the men's reaction to the potential damage to the organ, which creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

9. 9/9 - This paragraph is very suspenseful, as it describes the opening of the case and the discovery that the organ has been damaged. The use of words like "ruptured" and "stream of refrigerated air" creates a sense of horror.

10-12. 8-9/9 - The rest of the story is very suspenseful, as it describes the attempt to save the liver and the diagnosis that it's too late. The use of words like "urgently" and "the metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears" creates a sense of urgency and tension. The final diagnosis of Robert's death is particularly suspenseful and tragic.
