Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - This paragraph sets the stage for a medical story, which is intriguing, but it's a fairly straightforward and factual introduction, so it's not particularly suspenseful.

2. 4 - The arrival of the helicopter and the medical team is a significant event, and the use of the word "punctually" adds a sense of tension, so this paragraph is getting a higher rating.

3. 3 - The image of the man carrying a small blue fridge in the shape of a case is unusual and slightly intriguing, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

4. 1 - This paragraph is just a minor detail about the cleaner not putting out a "wet floor" sign, so it's not suspenseful at all.

5. 4 - The fact that the men are walking down the stairs and something goes wrong is a classic setup for a dramatic event, so this paragraph is getting a higher rating.

6. 8 - The man's slip and the case falling down the stairs is a dramatic and intense moment, so this paragraph is very suspenseful.

7. 5 - The fact that the second man stays behind to supervise the case and the doctors have to be warned is a good follow-up to the previous dramatic event, so it's still a fairly suspenseful paragraph.

8. 3 - The arrival of the doctors is a turning point in the story, but it's not particularly suspenseful, as they're arriving to help, not to harm.

9. 7 - The fact that the organ is damaged and the doctors are examining it is a turning point in the story, and the word "ruptured" adds a sense of shock and horror, so this paragraph is getting a high rating.

10. 6 - The analysis showing that the organ is unusable is a crucial moment in the story, and it's a turning point in the fate of the patient, so this paragraph is very suspenseful.

11. 8 - The fact that the patient is going to die without the transplant is a dramatic and intense conclusion, so this paragraph is very suspenseful.

12. 9 - The final confirmation of the patient's death is a very suspenseful and dramatic ending, so I'm giving it a high rating.
