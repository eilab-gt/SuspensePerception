Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 (not very suspensful) - This is a straightforward introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the story. It's informative, but not particularly engaging or suspenseful.

2. 3 (mildly suspensful) - We're starting to get a sense of the plot unfolding, with the helicopter landing and the organ being transported. It's still fairly straightforward, but there's a hint of tension building.

3. 4 (mildly suspensful) - The introduction of the strange object (the small blue fridge) and the actions of the two men make me wonder what's going on, and I'm starting to feel a bit more curious.

4. 5 (moderately suspensful) - Now we're getting to the meat of the story. The cleaner not putting up a "wet floor" sign and the men deciding to walk down the stairs without being careful... this is where things start to go awry.

5. 7 (highly suspensful) - Whoa, the man carrying the case slips and it falls down the stairs! This is where the tension really ramps up.

6. 8 (highly suspensful) - The doctors are called in, and I'm guessing something is very wrong. I'm on the edge of my seat, wondering what's happening to the organ.

7. 6 (highly suspensful) - The doctors arrive and open the case, and... the interior bag has ruptured. This is getting really intense!

8. 9 (very suspensful) - The organ is damaged, and the team is dealing with the consequences. I'm on the edge of my seat, wondering what happens next.

9. 9 (very suspensful) - The outcome is finally revealed: Robert Bent's death is due to the damage to the organ. This is a real emotional punch to the gut.
