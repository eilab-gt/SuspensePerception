Here are the suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 4/9 (The story is setting the scene, but it's not very suspenseful yet.)

2. 5/9 (The helicopter has landed, and the two men are getting out, but there's no real tension or danger yet.)

3. 6/9 (The men are in a hurry, and there's a sense of urgency, but it's still not very suspenseful.)

4. 2/9 (This paragraph is quite mundane and not suspenseful at all.)

5. 7/9 (The men are on their way to deliver the liver, and there's a sense of urgency, but it's not very intense yet.)

6. 8/9 (The case falls down the stairs, and the men are worried about it being damaged. This is the first real sense of tension in the story.)

7. 9/9 (The men are frantically trying to retrieve the case, and the suspense is high. This is the most suspenseful part of the story so far.)

8. 8/9 (The doctor is checking the case, and the tension is still high. The reader is waiting to find out if the liver is damaged or not.)

9. 9/9 (The doctor opens the case, and it's ruptured, which is a major cliffhanger. The suspense is at its highest point so far.)

10. 7/9 (The diagnosis is critical, and the reader is on the edge of their seat, waiting to find out if the liver is usable.)

11. 8/9 (The doctor is performing a biopsy, and the suspense is high. The reader is worried that he might damage the liver or not get the right results.)

12. 1/9 (The suspense is over, and the outcome is revealed. The story is wrapping up, and it's not very suspenseful anymore.)
