Here are my ratings for the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. 4/9 - The paragraph sets the stage for a dramatic event, but it's still just background information and doesn't have much suspense.

2. 5/9 - The introduction of the helicopter and the organ being carried is suspenseful, but it's still quite predictable.

3. 6/9 - The action in this paragraph is more suspenseful, with the two men moving quickly and urgently, and the setting is ominous with the spinning blades and the "whirlwind" phrase.

4. 2/9 - This paragraph is a lull in the story, focusing on a minor character and a mundane task. It's not suspenseful at all.

5. 7/9 - The introduction of the service stairwell and the possibility of something going wrong is suspenseful, and the characters' actions are tense and quick.

7. 8/9 - The two men's reactions to the damaged case are suspenseful, as they worry about the consequences.

9. 8/9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the concern on his face are suspenseful, as is the fact that the organ has been damaged.

10. 6/9 - This paragraph is more informative and less suspenseful, but the stakes are high and the tension is still palpable.
