Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2/9 - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's quite straightforward and doesn't have much suspense.

2. 4/9 - This paragraph adds a bit of excitement with the helicopter landing, but it's still relatively tame.

3. 5/9 - The introduction of the two men and the blue fridge-case is a bit intriguing, and the fact that it's carrying a fully functioning liver raises some questions.

4. 3/9 - This paragraph seems like a minor detail, and the lack of a "wet floor" sign doesn't really add to the suspense.

5. 6/9 - The fact that the men are walking down the stairs and one of them slips is starting to build some tension, and the reader wonders what might happen to the case.

6. 7/9 - The case falling down the stairs is a real turning point, and the reader is likely to feel a sense of alarm and concern for the contents of the case.

7. 8/9 - The doctor rushing to warn others and the other man supervising the case is building the suspense and making the reader wonder what's going to happen next.

8. 8/9 - The doctors arriving quickly to open the case is a tense moment, and the reader is eager to know what they'll find inside.

9. 9/9 - The revelation that the bag has ruptured is a major plot twist, and the reader is likely to feel a sense of shock and alarm.

10. 7/9 - The fact that the liver is still usable after the accident is a relief, but the reader is still on edge, wondering what happened to Robert Bent and whether he'll receive the transplant.

11. 4/9 - This paragraph wraps up the story, but it's more of a conclusion than a suspenseful twist.

12. 1/9 - The final sentence is just a confirmation of what happened, and it doesn't add much suspense. Overall, the story has a slow build-up of suspense, but the payoff is relatively quick and not extremely suspenseful.
