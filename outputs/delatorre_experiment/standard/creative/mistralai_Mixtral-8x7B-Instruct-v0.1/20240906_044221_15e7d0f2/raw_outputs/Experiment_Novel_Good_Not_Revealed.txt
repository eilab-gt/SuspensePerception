The operation was expected to take six hours, and the team worked quickly and efficiently. However, as the hours passed, the medical team encountered several unexpected complications. First, the donor liver was slightly larger than Robert's, making it difficult to fit into the smaller space. Then, the liver's blood vessels were more tangled than expected, making the connection process more complex. The donor liver also had a higher fat content, which increased the risk of rejection. Despite these challenges, the team remained focused and continued the operation.

5 As the cleaner reached the sixth floor, he noticed a pair of legs sticking out from behind the door to the service stairwell. Curious, he walked over and peered around the door.

7 The cleaner nervously approached the bed and looked at the man's face. It was the same man he had seen on the floor, but his appearance had changed drastically. His hair was dishevelled, his suit wrinkled, and his eyes were sunken and tired. The man looked up and saw the cleaner. "Thank you," he whispered, his voice weak and raspy. "You saved my life." The cleaner was taken aback. He didn't know what to say. The police officer stepped forward. "Sir, can you tell us what happened?" The man shook his head. "I don't remember. I was on my way to a party on the sixth floor when I felt dizzy. The next thing I knew, I was on the floor."
