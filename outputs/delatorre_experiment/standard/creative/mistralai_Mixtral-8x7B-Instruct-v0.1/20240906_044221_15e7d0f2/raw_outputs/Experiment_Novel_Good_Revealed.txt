 3 This story is presented as a real event, which adds a level of suspense as it invites the reader to be concerned about the outcome of the situation. However, since the main event (the successful transplant) has already been revealed in the opening paragraph, the suspense is limited. The focus of the suspense now shifts to whether Robert will survive the wait for the transplant, which is information that the reader does not yet have.
 The day started like any other for Robert Bent. He woke up early, excited to finally be going home after weeks of hospitalization. But little did he know, this would be a day he would start to remember for the rest of his life. 

5 This paragraph raises the stakes by giving the reader insight into Robert's perspective and setting up the contrast between his expectations for the day (going home) and the reality (staying in the hospital for a transplant).

The fact that the reader is aware of the upcoming event (the transplant) but Robert is not, also creates suspense as the reader waits for him to find out.

   2 The cleaner’s routine was always the same. There were no surprises, no exceptions. Until that day, when, as he was about to take the lift back down to the ground floor, he noticed a pair of feet sticking out from behind one of the red fire extinguishers. He approached cautiously, with his heart pounding. When he saw the face of the person lying on the floor, his heart skipped a beat. It was Robert Bent’s father, lying unconscious, with a small pool of blood forming around his head. Doctors and nurses rushed to his side, and the cleaner, still in shock, realized he had been the one to find him.

The following days were filled with grief for Robert and his family, and the transplant suddenly seemed less important. However, Robert’s father had been an organ donor, and the liver that had been transplanted into Robert came from him.

8 This paragraph provides a dramatic twist to the story, with the revelation that Robert's father was the donor of the liver that was transplanted into him.
