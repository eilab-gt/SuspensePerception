 I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 7 out of 9. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency and tension, with the young patient's life hanging in the balance as they wait for a liver transplant. The use of descriptive language such as "critical" and "imminent" helps to build suspense and keep the reader engaged.
 At 9 a.m. a call came from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), informing the hospital that the donor liver was on its way, and it was a perfect match for Robert. The medical team swung into action, preparing the operating room and the equipment needed for the transplant. The atmosphere in the hospital was electric, with everyone acutely aware of the significance of the moment. The surgery was scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., and the medical team had only two hours to prepare. As the clock ticked down, the tension in the hospital grew palpable. (8/9)

The medical team at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital had done their job, and they were proud of what they had accomplished. But they knew that the real hero in this story was the
 I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 6 out of 9. The paragraph provides a sense of anticipation and tension, with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the donor liver building up to the imminent transplant surgery. However, since the reader is already aware of the successful outcome from the previous paragraphs, it does not hold as much suspense as earlier events.
  Just as the helicopter landed, the transplant coordinator, Lori Spindler, received the crucial information that the liver was indeed a perfect match for Robert.

 I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 7 out of 9. The paragraph provides a sense of anticipation and tension, with the arrival of the organ-carrying case building up to the imminent transplant surgery. The urgency of the situation is conveyed through descriptive language such as "small blue fridge" and "fully functioning liver," which emphasizes the preciousness and importance of the organ. The reader is aware of the critical condition of the patient and the fact that the organ is a perfect match, but the successful outcome is not yet guaranteed, adding to the suspense.
   As the medical team prepared for the transplant surgery, the organ procurement team worked quickly and efficiently to remove the liver from the donor. The organ had to be transported to the operating room within a narrow window of time, as every minute counted in order to save Robert's life.

  I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 4 out of 9. The paragraph provides some context for the scene, but it does not directly contribute to the narrative about the liver transplant. The fact that the cleaner had finished mopping the floor and did not put up a "wet floor" sign is not particularly suspenseful or related to the urgent situation facing the medical team. The reader is aware of the critical condition of the patient and the imminent transplant surgery, but the paragraph does not build up or release tension related to those elements.
    The cleaner's failure to display the "wet floor" sign had serious consequences. As the organ procurement team made their way down the service stairwell, carrying the donor liver, they did not see the freshly mopped floor. One of the team members slipped and fell, and the organ was jostled out of its protective casing. The team was devastated - they had worked so hard to retrieve the liver, and now it was damaged. They knew that they had to act fast to save it, and they quickly assessed the damage. Miraculously, the liver appeared to be safe, and they were able to transport it to the operating room. (7/9)

   I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 5 out of 9. The paragraph provides some context for the scene, but it does not directly contribute to the narrative about the liver transplant. The fact that the two men chose to walk down the service stairwell is not particularly suspenseful, although the reader is aware of the critical condition of the patient and the imminent transplant surgery. The paragraph does set the stage for the next paragraph, in which the cleaner's failure to display the "wet floor" sign leads to a dangerous situation for the organ procurement team.

    The number of organ donors in the United States has been steadily declining over the past decade, leading to a shortage of organs available for transplant. This shortage has resulted in long wait times for patients in need of a transplant, with many dying before an organ becomes available. For Robert Bent, the situation was critical. He was in end-stage liver failure and needed a transplant urgently in order to survive. As the medical team waited for a donor liver to become available, they were acutely aware of the ticking clock. Every moment that passed brought Robert closer to the brink of death. When a suitable donor was finally found, the team was relieved but knew that they had to act fast to save Robert's life. (7/9)
