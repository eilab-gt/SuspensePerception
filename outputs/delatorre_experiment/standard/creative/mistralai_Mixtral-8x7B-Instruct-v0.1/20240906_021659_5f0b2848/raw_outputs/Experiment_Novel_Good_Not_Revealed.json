 5: The suspense in this paragraph comes from the introduction of a new character, the cleaner, and the ominous foreshadowing of something going wrong in the service stairwell. However, since we don't know yet how this will affect the liver transplant, the suspense is relatively mild.

6: This paragraph ramps up the suspense significantly, as we see the man carrying the liver case slip and drop the case, which rolls down the stairs and potentially damages the organ. The image of the case spinning down the stairs is particularly effective at creating a sense of dread.

7: While this paragraph is mainly focused on the aftermath of the dropped case and the steps taken to assess the damage, the urgency of the situation and the tension between the two men is still palpable. The suspense here is less immediate than in the previous paragraph but still present.

8: This paragraph further heightens the suspense as we learn that the case has indeed been damaged, and the liver may not be usable. The description of the split in the case and the escaping refrigerated air is particularly effective at conveying the urgency of the situation.

10-11: These paragraphs are some of the most suspenseful in the story, as we see the surgeon carefully examining the liver to determine if it has been damaged. The stakes are high, and the tension is palpable as the surgeon inserts the needle and extracts a sample. The relief when the biopsy shows that the liver has not been damaged is palpable.

Overall, I would rate the suspense level of this story as a 9 out of 9. The author does an excellent job of building tension and keeping the reader on the edge of their seat, wondering if the liver transplant will be successful.
