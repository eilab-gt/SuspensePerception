Here are the suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **4:** The introduction sets a serious tone and hints at a critical situation, but doesn't provide enough specific details to be highly suspenseful.
2. **3:** This paragraph is fairly straightforward and lacks tension. We know the organ is arriving, but the focus is on logistical details.
3. **5:**  The urgency is starting to build as the men rush with the organ, and the emphasis on the critical condition of the patient adds some suspense.
4. **2:** This paragraph shifts to a seemingly unrelated story about the cleaner, which momentarily lowers the suspense.
5. **6:** The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift introduces a possible delay and raises the stakes slightly.
6. **8:** The fall and the rolling case create a very tense moment, making this the most suspenseful paragraph so far.
7. **7:** The potential damage to the liver and the urgency to alert the doctors maintain a high level of suspense.
8. **6:** The man guarding the case builds anticipation as we wait to see the doctor's reaction.
9. **7:** The description of the damage to the case and the escaping refrigerated air intensifies the suspense.
10. **7:** The hope for the liver's survival and the surgeon's careful actions keep the tension high.
11. **8:** The suspense reaches its peak as the surgeon examines the biopsy, knowing that the child's fate hangs in the balance.

12. **2:** The ending, while tragic, is not unexpected given the buildup, and the suspense dissipates.
