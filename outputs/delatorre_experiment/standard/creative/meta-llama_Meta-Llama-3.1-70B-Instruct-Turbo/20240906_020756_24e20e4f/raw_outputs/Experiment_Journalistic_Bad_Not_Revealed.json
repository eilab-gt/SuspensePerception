I'll rate the suspense level for each paragraph.

1. What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. This is the story of what happened.
Suspense level: 5 - This introduction sets up the critical situation and raises questions about the outcome, but it's still a relatively calm and informative start.

2. At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition.
Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph provides more details about the situation but doesn't introduce any new tension or conflict.

3. Two men descended from the helicopter, one of whom was carrying a small blue fridge, in the shape of a case, which stored the fully functioning liver.
Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph is more of a straightforward description of the events unfolding.

4. Minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign.
Suspense level: 4 - This paragraph introduces a potential hazard (the wet floor) and foreshadows a possible accident.

5. The two men transporting the liver left the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell, which they decided to walk down.
Suspense level: 6 - This paragraph raises the stakes by putting the characters in a situation where they might encounter the hazard mentioned earlier.

6. As a result, the moment the man carrying the case placed his foot on the steps he slipped, and the case plunged down the stairs.
Suspense level: 9 - This paragraph is the climax of the story so far, with a sudden and intense accident that puts the liver and the transplant in jeopardy.

7. His colleague immediately went to warn the doctors whilst he, after regaining his footing, stayed supervising the case, which was not handled in any way until the doctors arrived.
Suspense level: 7 - The accident has happened
