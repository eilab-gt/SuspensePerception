I'll provide the suspense rating for each paragraph.

1. Rating: 2 - The first paragraph is more introductory and sets the stage for the story. It doesn't create much suspense.

2. Rating: 3 - The second paragraph is fairly straightforward and mainly provides information about the arrival of the helicopter. There's some tension due to the critical condition of the patient, but it's not overly suspenseful.

3. Rating: 4 - The third paragraph introduces a sense of urgency and the importance of the situation, which creates a bit more tension.

4. Rating: 1 - The fourth paragraph is quite mundane, focusing on the cleaner's routine, and doesn't create any suspense.

5. Rating: 5 - The fifth paragraph increases the tension as the characters navigate the hospital, and the reader is aware of the importance of the liver's timely arrival.

6. Rating: 9 - The sixth paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as the accident with the case creates a critical situation that could have disastrous consequences.

7. Rating: 8 - The seventh paragraph is tense as the characters try to assess the damage to the case and the liver.

8. Rating: 6 - The eighth paragraph maintains a moderate level of suspense as the character waits anxiously for the doctors to arrive and assess the situation.

9. Rating: 8 - The ninth paragraph creates a sense of dread as the doctors examine the case and reveal the damage.

10. Rating: 7 - The tenth paragraph is still suspenseful, but the initial diagnosis provides some hope, which slightly reduces the tension.

11. Rating: 9 - The eleventh paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as the surgeon performs the biopsy and the outcome is uncertain.

12. Rating: 1 - The twelfth and final paragraph resolves the tension, as the medical team confirms that the liver is functioning correctly, which creates a sense of relief rather than suspense.
