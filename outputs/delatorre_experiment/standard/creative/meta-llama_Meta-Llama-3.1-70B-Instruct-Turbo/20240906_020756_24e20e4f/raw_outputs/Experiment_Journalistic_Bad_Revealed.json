I'll rate each paragraph's level of suspense on a 9-point scale.

1. What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. This is the story of what happened.

Suspense level: 8 - The introduction sets up a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder what happened and how it unfolded.

2. At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition.

Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph provides more context, but it's a relatively calm and straightforward statement, not building much suspense.

3. Two men descended from the helicopter, one of whom was carrying a small blue fridge, in the shape of a case, which stored the fully functioning liver.

Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is still setting the scene and providing more details, but it doesn't add much tension.

4. Minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign.

Suspense level: 6 - This paragraph introduces a subtle hint of potential danger, foreshadowing an accident, which raises the suspense level.

5. The two men transporting the liver left the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell, which they decided to walk down.

Suspense level: 4 - The decision to walk down the stairs instead of using an elevator or other route creates a sense of inevitability, but it's still a fairly calm and ordinary action.

6. As a result, the moment the man carrying the case placed his foot on the steps he slipped, and the case plunged down the stairs.

Suspense level: 9 - This paragraph is where
