Suspense level: 8

This paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the hectic scene on the rooftop, with the whirlwind of the helicopter blades and the men rushing to deliver the liver. The mention of the patient's critical situation and the need to hurry adds to the suspense, and the use of visual details like the men ducking down and the nod of understanding between them creates a vivid and dynamic scene. The only thing holding me back from giving it a 9 is that the outcome of the situation is still somewhat predictable, and the paragraph doesn't introduce any major surprises or plot twists.

Suspense level: 2

This paragraph is a stark contrast to the previous one, as it shifts the focus to a mundane and uneventful scene. The description of the cleaner's routine is detailed, but it's not suspenseful in any way. The tone is calm and matter-of-fact, and there's no sense of urgency or tension. The only potentially ominous detail is the lack of "wet floor" warning signs, but it's not enough to create significant suspense at this point. The paragraph feels more like a calm before a potential storm, but as it stands, it's not suspenseful on its own.

Suspense level: 6

This paragraph creates some sense of urgency and tension as the two men hurry to deliver the liver to the patient on the 6th floor. The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds to the sense of haste, and the physical description of the hospital's layout helps to create a sense of realism. However, the situation is still relatively straightforward, and there's no major obstacle or complication that would elevate the suspense level to its highest. The men's conversation is also fairly matter-of-fact, which keeps the tone from becoming too intense.

However, the situation is now under control, and the men are taking deliberate and careful action to mitigate the damage.

Suspense level: 8

This paragraph is still suspenseful as it maintains the uncertainty and concern about the liver's condition. The focus on the man's physical pain and his superstition adds a layer of emotional tension, making the situation feel more intense and personal. The fact that he's willing to suffer in exchange for the liver's safety creates a sense of desperation and raises the stakes. The arrival of the doctors is a welcome relief, but the request to move away creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about what will happen next. The only thing holding me back from giving it a 9 is that the tone is still somewhat introspective and emotional, rather than purely suspenseful. The situation is still tense, but the focus is on the character's emotional state rather than a pure action-oriented plot twist.

The doctor's headshake and the brief description of the damage are all that's needed to convey the gravity of the situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The suspense level is extremely high as the story has now reached a critical point, and the outcome is uncertain.

Suspense level: 8

This paragraph is still suspenseful, but the level of tension decreases slightly as the surgeon successfully completes the biopsy and the sample is being analyzed. The description of the surgeon's relief and the detailed process of the biopsy creates a sense of realism, but the focus shifts from the high-stakes action to the anticipation of the diagnosis. The surgeon's body language, such as wiping sweat from his brow and pursing his lips, adds to the sense of tension, but the outcome is still uncertain. The interminable half a minute creates a sense of time dragging on, making the reader feel anxious about the diagnosis. However, the final sentence, which reveals that the organ has not been damaged, provides a sense of relief and reduces the suspense level. The outcome is still not entirely certain, as the story may take a new turn, but the immediate crisis has been averted.
