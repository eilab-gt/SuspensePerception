2 As the clock struck 8 a.m. on 24 February 2008, Robert Bent and the team at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital were holding their breath. It had been a long and difficult journey for the eight-year-old boy, but a suitable liver donor had finally been found.

However, the wait for the organ was a nerve-wracking one, as Robert's condition was critical, and there was no guarantee that he would make it through.

3 As the hours passed, the medical team grew increasingly anxious. The liver, although suitable, had to travel a long way to reach Robert, and there was a risk that it may be damaged in transit.

The hours seemed to drag on, and it seemed like the organ might not arrive in time.

It was a moment of relief and joy for everyone in the hospital, as they knew that Robert had been given a second chance at life.

He was able to leave the hospital and return to a normal life, playing with his friends and doing the things that all eight-year-olds love to do. His family was overjoyed, and they knew that they owed it all to the generous donor and the dedicated medical team at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.
