 In 2007, Robert Bent was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a rare and life-threatening disease that affects the bile ducts in the liver of infants. The only effective treatment is a liver transplant. The race to find a donor began immediately, but no suitable matches were found. Until February 24, 2008, when they finally found a compatible liver donor, just one day before Robert's scheduled transplant. 5 (Suspensful)

On February 24, Robert was wheeled into surgery at the UCSF Benioff Childrenâ€™s Hospital, surrounded by his loved ones.
