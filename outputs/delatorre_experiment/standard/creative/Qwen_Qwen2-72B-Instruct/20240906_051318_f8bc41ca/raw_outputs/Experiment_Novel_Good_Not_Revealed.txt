This paragraph provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine, which contrasts with the high-stakes situation in the hospital. The lack of suspense in the cleaner's mundane activities and the absence of any immediate danger or tension make this paragraph not particularly suspenseful. The detailed description of the cleaning process and the cleaner's thoughts do not contribute to building suspense.

This paragraph provides a resolution to the tension built up throughout the narrative, with the confirmation that the liver transplant was successful despite the earlier mishap. The specific time stamp adds a note of precision and finality, signaling the end of the immediate crisis. The suspense level, in this case, is a 5. It's moderately suspenseful as it offers closure, but the tension is not as acute since the outcome is positive. The reader may feel a sense of relief and satisfaction that the transplant was successful, despite the earlier setbacks. The rating is not higher because the paragraph does not contain elements of uncertainty or immediate danger, which are typically associated with higher levels of suspense.
