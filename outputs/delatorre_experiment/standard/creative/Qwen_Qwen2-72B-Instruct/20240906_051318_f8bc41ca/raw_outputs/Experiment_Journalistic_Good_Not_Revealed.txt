The paragraph provides a resolution to the tension surrounding the transplant's success, indicating that the liver is functioning correctly and was not affected by the damage sustained during transit. While this resolves some of the uncertainty and therefore reduces the overall suspense, there is still a moderate level of suspense as the long-term health of the patient and the effectiveness of the transplant remain unknown. The use of specific timing ("finally, at 21:26") adds a sense of finality but does not completely remove the element of suspense as the full outcome is yet to be seen.
