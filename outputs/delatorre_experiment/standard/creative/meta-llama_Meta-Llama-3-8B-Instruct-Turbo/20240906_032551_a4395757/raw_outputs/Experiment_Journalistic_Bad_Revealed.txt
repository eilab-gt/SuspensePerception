I would rate the suspensfulness of this paragraph as a 2 out of 9. The story is presented as a real event, and the facts are presented in a matter-of-fact way, which makes it more informative than suspenseful. The tension is not built up in this paragraph, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next. The outcome of the story is also known, which makes it less suspenseful.

I would rate the suspensfulness of this paragraph as a 3 out of 9. The paragraph is brief and provides some information about the events, but it doesn't create much tension or uncertainty.

The reader is left wondering what might happen as a result of the cleaner's action, and the use of the word "wet" in a context where it might be relevant to the story creates a sense of uncertainty. However, the paragraph is still somewhat straightforward and doesn't have a huge emotional payoff, so it's not a 9 out of 9.

The fact that the two men decide to walk down the stairwell, rather than taking the elevator, creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about what might happen to them. However, the paragraph doesn't have a huge emotional payoff, and the tension is somewhat released by the fact that the men are walking down the stairwell rather than taking a more dramatic action.

I would rate the suspensfulness of this paragraph as an 8 out of 9. The paragraph creates a sense of shock and surprise as the reader is suddenly dropped into a high-stakes situation. The sudden and unexpected slip of the man's foot, combined with the fact that the case (containing the liver) is plummeting down the stairs, creates a sense of urgency and tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and is on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what happens to the case and the liver. The only reason it's not a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is relatively short and doesn't have as much emotional buildup as some other paragraphs might.
