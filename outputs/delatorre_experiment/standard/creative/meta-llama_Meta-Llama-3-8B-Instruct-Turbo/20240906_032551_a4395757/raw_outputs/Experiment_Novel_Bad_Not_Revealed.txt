I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 5 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The story is setting the stage for a dramatic event, and there's a sense of urgency and uncertainty around Robert's condition and the transplant. However, it's still a relatively straightforward setup, and I don't feel a strong sense of tension or surprise yet.
Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. I'll rate its suspense level after reading it.
I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 3 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph provides a straightforward update on the timing of the helicopter's arrival, which is a relief (no pun intended!) for Robert. While it's a small milestone in the story, it doesn't create a sense of tension or surprise, so I wouldn't say it's particularly suspenseful.

I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The description of the two men descending from the helicopter, the importance of the liver, and the urgency of the situation all contribute to a sense of tension and anticipation. The use of vivid details, such as the whirlwind of spinning blades and the man shouting something inaudible, adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph doesn't reveal any major surprises or plot twists, so I wouldn't say it's extremely suspenseful.

I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph is a mundane and descriptive account of a cleaner's routine morning tasks, with no hint of tension, surprise, or drama. The focus is on the details of the cleaner's job and the ordinary settings of the hospital, which creates a sense of normalcy and calm. There's no sense of urgency or anticipation, so I wouldn't say it's suspenseful at all.

I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The story is starting to take a turn, and the tension is building slightly. The conversation between the two men adds a sense of urgency and raises questions about the patient's condition and the significance of the liver. The mention of the 6th floor and the fact that it's "not worth taking the lift" creates a sense of anticipation, and the image of the man holding the banister creates a sense of foreboding. However, the pace is still relatively slow, and I wouldn't say it's extremely suspenseful yet.
Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. I'll rate its suspense level after reading it.
I'd rate the preceding paragraph an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The sudden twist of the man's ankle and his inability to stay upright creates a sense of shock and surprise. The fact that he has to let go of the case and it rolls down the stairs is a cliffhanger that raises questions about the fate of the liver and the patient's chances of survival. The description of the case making a noise like loose keys being shaken in a bag is also vivid and unsettling, adding to the tension. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively contained situation, and the consequences of the event are not yet clear.
Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. I'll rate its suspense level after reading it.
I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The scene has been set, and the consequences of the case's fall are still unfolding, but the pace of the story has slowed down slightly. The conversation between the two men is more of a procedural discussion, and the actions of the protagonist are focused on damage control rather than creating tension. While there's still a sense of urgency, the suspense level has decreased somewhat.

I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph introduces a sense of unease and tension through the protagonist's superstition and physical discomfort. The fact that the doctors are arriving soon adds to the sense of urgency, and the description of their appearance creates a sense of anticipation. However, the pace of the story is still relatively slow, and the suspense level is not yet at its peak.
Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. I'll rate its suspense level after reading it.
I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph builds tension by describing the opening of the case, which was previously a crucial element in the story. The image of the padded fridge and the rupture of the container creates a sense of disaster and catastrophe. The fact that the doctor shakes his head and closes the case implies that something has gone horribly wrong, and the slow progression of the refrigerated air escaping adds to the sense of doom. The suspense level is extremely high in this paragraph, as the reader is left wondering what the consequences of this event will be for Robert and the medical team.

I'd rate the preceding paragraph an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph creates a sense of high stakes and tension as the medical team is about to perform a critical biopsy on Robert's liver. The description of the surgeon's nervousness and the potential for disaster if he's one millimetre off adds to the suspense. The fact that the child's life is hanging in the balance raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the pace of the story is still relatively slow and methodical, which tempers the suspense slightly.
Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. I'll rate its suspense level after reading it.
I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph builds tension as the surgeon performs the biopsy, and the reader is left wondering what the results will be. The description of the surgeon's reactions, such as wiping sweat from his brow and pursing his lips, adds to the sense of anticipation. The fact that the metabolic rate confirms the surgeon's worst fears creates a sense of dread and hopelessness. The use of words like "interminable" and "worst fears" adds to the sense of suspense, making it difficult for the reader to look away. The implication that the liver has deteriorated as a result of the impact is a major turning point in the story, and the suspense level is extremely high in this paragraph.

I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph is a punch to the gut, as it reveals the tragic outcome of the story. The fact that the medical team was unable to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage to the organ is devastating, and the certification of Robert's death at 21:26 is a bleak and hopeless conclusion. The suspense level is extremely high in this paragraph, as the reader is left feeling a sense of loss and tragedy at the end of the story.
