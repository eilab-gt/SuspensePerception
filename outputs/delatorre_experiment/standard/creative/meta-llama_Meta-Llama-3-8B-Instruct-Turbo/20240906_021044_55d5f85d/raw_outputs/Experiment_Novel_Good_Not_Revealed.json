Here are my ratings for suspense:

1. Not suspensful (1.0)

The first paragraph sets the scene and establishes the stakes, but it's a relatively straightforward introduction to the story.

2. Suspensful (4.5)

The arrival of the helicopter and the men carrying the organ creates tension, and the unknown fate of Robert Bent's condition adds suspense.

3. Suspensful (6.0)

The scene at the helipad exit and the accidental drop of the organ case creates a sense of urgency and raises concerns about the potential consequences.

4. Not suspensful (1.0)

The scene in the service stairwell is mundane and doesn't contribute to the suspense of the story.

5. Suspensful (5.5)

The scene at the helipad exit and the discussion about taking the lift creates tension, and the intention to walk down two floors adds a sense of urgency.

6. Very suspensful (8.5)

The sudden slip and fall of the man carrying the organ case, and the subsequent watching of the case rolling down the stairs, creates a sense of intense suspense.

7. Very suspensful (8.0)

The scene where the men examine the case and worry about potential damage adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering about the fate of the organ.

8. Suspensful (6.5)

The man's thoughts and superstitions create a sense of unease, and the impending arrival of the doctors adds to the tension.

9. Very suspensful (8.0)

The scene where the doctor opens the case and finds the organ damaged creates a sense of shock and raises concerns about the potential consequences for Robert Bent's condition.

10-12. Suspensful (5.0-6.0)

The subsequent scenes, including the examination of the liver and the diagnosis, create a sense of tension and suspense as the reader waits for the outcome of Robert Bent's condition.

Note that the suspense levels are subjective and may vary depending on individual readers' preferences and experiences.
