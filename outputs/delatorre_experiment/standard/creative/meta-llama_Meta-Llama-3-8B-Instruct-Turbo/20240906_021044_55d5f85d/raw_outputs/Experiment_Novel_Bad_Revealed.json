Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. 3/9 - The story starts with a dramatic event, but the context is still unclear, making it not very suspenseful.

2. 4/9 - The helicopter landing and the two men descending with the organ case creates some tension, but the scene is still relatively straightforward.

3. 5/9 - The cleaner's mundane job and the sudden interruption by the two men create a sense of surprise, but the story hasn't built up much tension yet.

4. 2/9 - The cleaner's story is a diversion that adds little to the main plot, making it not very suspenseful.

5. 6/9 - The man carrying the case and his colleague's discussion about the patient and the liver transplant creates some tension, and the reader starts to feel the stakes.

6. 8/9 - The case falling down the stairs creates a sense of panic and raises the stakes, making it a more suspenseful paragraph.

7. 7/9 - The two men's reaction to the fallen case and their decision to check on the liver creates tension and makes the reader wonder if the liver is still viable.

8. 6/9 - The colleague's superstition and the tension as they wait for the doctors to arrive creates a sense of anticipation.

9. 8/9 - The doctor's examination of the liver and the revelation that it has been damaged creates a sense of dread and raises the stakes.

10. 5/9 - The initial diagnosis and the possibility of the liver still being viable creates some tension, but the story is starting to feel a bit predictable.

11. 8/9 - The surgeon's anxiety and the tension as he carries out the biopsy creates a sense of anticipation and raises the stakes.

12. 9/9 - The final revelation that the liver is no longer viable and the medical team's confirmation of Robert's death creates a sense of tragedy and resolution.
