I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph after I finish reading it. Here are my ratings:

1. Not suspensful (1) - This is an introduction to the story and doesn't create any tension or suspense.

2. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph simply describes the arrival of the helicopter and the organ.

3. Suspensful (5) - The two men are rushing to deliver the organ, and the scene is set for something to go wrong.

4. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is a mundane description of a hospital cleaner's routine and doesn't contribute to the suspense.

5. Suspensful (6) - The men are about to carry the organ down the stairs, and the reader can sense that something might go wrong.

6. Suspensful (8) - The man carrying the organ slips and drops it, which creates a sense of danger and uncertainty.

7. Suspensful (8) - The men are concerned that the organ might be damaged, and the reader is on edge waiting to find out the result.

8. Suspensful (7) - The colleague is trying not to move, overcome with superstition, which adds to the tension.

9. Suspensful (7) - The doctor opens the case, and the reader is relieved to find out that the organ might still be usable.

10. Suspensful (6) - The liver is being examined, and the reader is waiting to find out if it's damaged or not.
