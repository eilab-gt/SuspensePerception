I found the preceding paragraph to be a 3 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph sets the stage for a potentially dramatic and intense story, but it doesn't quite have the hook or the sense of foreboding that would make it more suspenseful. The information about Robert's critical condition and the delay in the transplant is somewhat clinical and factual, and the actual event that happens (the donor organ's damage) is more of a tragic twist than a surprise.
1 What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. This is the story of what happened.

Suspensefulness: 3/9. The paragraph sets the stage for a potentially dramatic story, but it's more of a factual setup than a suspenseful one.

2 The fate of Robert Bent would be reduced to a sequence of numbers and official records: the single donor liver never made it to the hospital because it was left on the ground at the donor site for nearly 3 hours after the donor’s heart had stopped beating. The moment of sudden death had been at 18:00 and the liver had been promptly removed. Unfortunately, during the 2 hour and 40 minutes between the removal and the subsequent inspection, it was left outside with the risk of temperature fluctuations, which damaged the organ beyond usability. This was the reason the medical team was unable to perform the transplant.

Suspensefulness: 7/9. The addition of the specific numbers and details about the liver's damage raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The reader starts to wonder what could have been done differently to save the organ and Robert's life.
Suspensefulness: 1/9. This paragraph is very unsurprising and routine, and it doesn't hint at any potential problems or complications that could create suspense. The mention of the helicopter landing punctually is actually a fairly ordinary event, and it doesn't add any sense of tension or drama.
2 At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition.

Suspensefulness: 1/9. This paragraph is very unsurprising and routine, and it doesn't hint at any potential problems or complications that could create suspense. The mention of the helicopter landing punctually is actually a fairly ordinary event, and it doesn't add any sense of tension or drama.

3 However, at that moment, a 29-year-old man called Harley DiNardo, a UCSF senior maintenance engineer, had been on a maintenance call on the hospital roof. This man who had simply been at the wrong place, at the wrong time would be the cause of a potentially catastrophic sequence of events.
Suspensefulness: 6/9. This paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension, as the characters are in a hurry to get the liver to the patient in time. The use of words like "whirlwind", "shouting", and "no time to lose" creates a sense of chaos and urgency. However, the paragraph is still somewhat descriptive and focused on the actions of the characters, rather than creating a sense of mystery or uncertainty that would make it more suspenseful. The reader can infer that something might go wrong, but it's not yet clear what.
3 Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible. Realizing that he hadn’t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose.

Suspensefulness: 6/9.

4 During this sequence of events, completely unaware of the true nature of what was about to unfold, Harley DiNardo, the 29-year-old maintenance man, decided to take a shortcut through the door off the roof, which opened directly onto the maintenance tunnel.
Suspensefulness: 1/9. This paragraph is a completely tranquil and mundane scene, with a focus on the everyday routine of a cleaner. There's no sense of tension, danger, or uncertainty, and the reader is aware that nothing out of the ordinary is about to happen. The paragraph's calm and ordinary tone actually makes it feel almost jarring in the context of the previous paragraphs, which were building up to a potential disaster.
4 Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital’s eight floors. It wasn’t a particularly interesting job. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of colour on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. Overall, it was an agreeable job. However, the service stairwell wasn’t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building’s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn’t bother to position the ”wet floor” warning signs at the top of each section. That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley and continued his typical working day.

Suspensefulness: 1/9.

5 Harley DiNardo, unaware of the impending disaster, entered the service stairwell with the haste and confidence that came from being in a rush.
Suspensefulness: 2/9. This paragraph is setting the stage for a potential disaster, but it's not particularly suspenseful yet. The focus is on the mundane details of the hospital's layout and the conversation between the two men. The reader can sense that something might go wrong, but it's not clear what. The mention of the 6th floor and the patient being there creates a slight sense of tension, but it's not enough to make the paragraph very suspenseful.
5 The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital’s secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor. It’s not worth taking the lift,” he said, realising his colleague’s intention. “By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it’ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.” His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand.

Suspensefulness: 2/9.

6 At the same time, in the corridor below, the cleaning man, with the cleaning trolley in front of him, continued down to the ground floor, whistling a tune that echoed through the deserted corridor, not suspecting anything.
Suspensefulness: 8/9. This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The sudden twist in the cleaning man's fate, combined with the potential disaster of the case rolling down the stairs and being damaged, creates a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is invested in what happens next, and the use of descriptive language ("horror", "noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag") adds to the sense of drama and foreboding.
6 His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag.

Suspensefulness: 8/9.

7 The doctor, still on the 5th floor, furrowed his brow in a look of concern as he watched the scene unfold. The helicopter had left the roof at 08:57 and the liver had been taken to the operating theatre.
Suspensefulness: 8/9. This paragraph is very suspenseful. The reader is on edge, waiting to see what happens to the case and the liver inside. The tension is palpable as the two men consider whether to open the case, and the doctor's decision to leave it untouched only adds to the suspense. The reader is also wondering what will happen next, and whether the medical team will be able to revive the patient in time. The fact that the doctor goes to alert the team adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
7 Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted.

Suspensefulness: 8/9.

8 Meanwhile, the elevator carrying Harley DiNardo back to his usual post had stopped on the third floor, with him standing still inside. He didn’t hear a thing from outside.
Suspensefulness: 4/9. This paragraph is somewhat suspenseful, as the reader is aware that the situation is critical and that the liver may be damaged. The mention of the doctors arriving and the protagonist's superstition adds a hint of tension. However, the paragraph is not as suspenseful as the previous one, as the outcome of the situation is starting to become clear. The arrival of the doctors suggests that the crisis is about to be resolved, but the reader is still invested in the outcome.
8 Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. “Move away, please,” asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case.

Suspensefulness: 4/9.

9 The two men looked at each other and then stepped away, slowly. Behind them they heard the gentle buzzing of a cutter. After several minutes the three doctors carefully took out the liver, cut the sutures and put it into a plastic container.
Suspensefulness: 7/9. This paragraph is quite suspenseful, as the reader is aware that the fate of the liver (and therefore Robert Bent's life) hangs in the balance. The revelation that the fridge has ruptured and the liver has been damaged is a major twist, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of phrases like "long split down one side" and "thin stream of refrigerated air" creates a sense of calm after the storm, which makes the reader more aware of the gravity of the situation.
9 He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping.

Suspensefulness: 7/9.

10 A massive sadness flooded over his face, his eyes sank and his voice barely carried when he said, “The organ was damaged beyond repair during the fall. There is no chance for transplantation.” The news seemed to spread throughout the corridors as doctors and nurses stood frozen, almost equally as aghast, and without realising the harsh implications of the doctors’ words, moved towards the surgery room with purpose, even though the hope was already lost.
Suspensefulness: 9/9. This paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as the reader is on the edge of their seat, waiting to see the outcome of the biopsy. The medical team's hope is revived, but the risk of damaging the organ irreparably is still very high, and the surgeon's nervousness adds to the tension. The phrase "if he was one millimetre out" creates a sense of inevitability, implying that the margin for error is extremely small. The reader is fully invested in the outcome, and the suspense is palpable.
10 According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child’s life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably.

Suspensefulness: 9/9.

11 At the same moment, in the 6th floor’s waiting room, the mother of Robert Bent waited anxiously for news. With tears in her eyes, but a hopeful smile on her face, she comforted her young son who had been bedridden in his hospital bed for the past several months.
Suspensefulness: 9/9. This paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as the reader is aware that the fate of the organ and Robert Bent's life hangs in the balance. The tension builds as the surgeon inserts the needle, draws out the plunger, and waits for the results. The use of phrases like "holding his breath", "relieved to not encounter any resistance", and "worst fears" creates a sense of high stakes and raises the reader's anxiety. The final sentence, "The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact", is particularly devastating, and the reader is left feeling a sense of impending doom.
11 Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact.

Suspensefulness: 9/9.

12 With a heavy heart, the doctor who had been watching the scene unfold announced the devastating news to the waiting family. Robert Bent's mother clutched her son tightly to her chest, tears streaming down her face as she hugged him closely. The boy looked up at his mother, his eyes wide with fear and confusion, and begged her to save him.
Suspensefulness: 1/9. This paragraph is not suspenseful at all. The outcome is already known, and the reader is simply being told the exact time and circumstances of Robert Bent's death. The paragraph is more of a conclusion to the story, and the tone is somber and reflective rather than suspenseful.
