I would rate the suspensefulness of the first paragraph a 6 out of 9. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and urgency, as the medical team is waiting for a critical transplant operation to take place. However, the tone is relatively subdued and matter-of-fact, which reduces the overall sense of tension. The fact that the story is presented as a real event and the details are provided in a straightforward manner also contributes to the relatively low suspense level.
This is a new paragraph. There are no preceding paragraphs for me to rate. Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph, and I'll be happy to rate the suspensefulness of the preceding paragraph.
I would rate the suspensefulness of the second paragraph a 2 out of 9. The paragraph suggests that everything is going smoothly and according to plan, with the helicopter landing on time. This lack of complications or unexpected twists reduces the sense of tension and suspense.
This is a new paragraph. There are no preceding paragraphs for me to rate. Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph, and I'll be happy to rate the suspensefulness of the preceding paragraph.

However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"2 At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition."

So, if you'd like, I can rate it now.

I would rate the suspensefulness of the second paragraph a 2 out of 9.
I would rate the suspensefulness of the third paragraph a 1 out of 9. The image of two men descending from a helicopter with a damaged liver in a blue fridge case is almost comically mundane, and the mention of the liver being "fully functioning" suggests that the crisis may have passed, reducing the sense of tension.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. 

However, if you'd like, I can still recall and rate the suspensefulness of the previous paragraph:

"3 Two men descended from the helicopter, one of whom was carrying a small blue fridge, in the shape of a case, which stored the fully functioning liver."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the third paragraph a 1 out of 9.
I would rate the suspensefulness of the fourth paragraph an 8 out of 9. The mention of a "wet floor" sign being left unattended, in the context of the previous paragraphs which have described a critical and high-stakes medical situation, creates a sense of potential chaos and catastrophe. The introduction of a mundane but potentially hazardous element like a wet floor suddenly makes the reader wonder if something is about to go terribly wrong.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"4 Minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the fourth paragraph an 8 out of 9.

Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph.
I would rate the suspensefulness of the fifth paragraph a 4 out of 9. The mention of the liver being transported down the service stairwell, which was previously described as having a wet floor, creates a sense of potential danger. However, the lack of any immediate consequences or complications reduces the overall sense of tension and suspense. The reader is still waiting for something to go wrong, but the expectation is building slowly.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"5 The two men transporting the liver left the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell, which they decided to walk down."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the fifth paragraph a 4 out of 9.

Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph.
I would rate the suspensefulness of the sixth paragraph a 9 out of 9. The sudden and unexpected event of the man slipping and the case plummeting down the stairs creates a dramatic and intense moment of tension. The combination of the previously mentioned "wet floor" and the critical nature of the liver transplant creates a sense of catastrophe, and the reader is likely to feel a strong sense of alarm and worry.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"6 As a result, the moment the man carrying the case placed his foot on the steps he slipped, and the case plunged down the stairs."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the sixth paragraph a 9 out of 9.

Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. 

(Note: The story is likely going to take a dramatic and intense turn, so I'm expecting a high suspense rating from the next paragraph as well.)
I would rate the suspensefulness of the seventh paragraph a 2 out of 9. The previous paragraph created a intense moment of tension, but the current paragraph seems to diffuse some of that tension by having the colleague react quickly and the second man regaining his footing. The fact that the case is left untouched until the doctors arrive suggests that the situation is being handled in a cautious and controlled manner, which reduces the sense of urgency and suspense.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"7 His colleague immediately went to warn the doctors whilst he, after regaining his footing, stayed supervising the case, which was not handled in any way until the doctors arrived."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the seventh paragraph a 2 out of 9.

Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph.

(Note: The story is taking a slightly more mundane turn, but the reader is likely still waiting for the outcome of the previous intense moment.)
I would rate the suspensefulness of the eighth paragraph a 1 out of 9. The paragraph is very brief and simply states a fact, without any sense of tension or resolution to the previous intense moment. The use of the word "promptly" suggests that the doctors arrived on time, which reduces the sense of uncertainty and suspense. The reader is likely expecting some outcome or consequence from the arrival of the doctors, but this paragraph provides no sense of resolution or progression.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"8 The doctors arrived promptly."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the eighth paragraph a 1 out of 9.

Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph.

(Note: The story is likely to have a dramatic conclusion soon, given the intense buildup of suspense.)!
I would rate the suspensefulness of the ninth paragraph an 8 out of 9. The revelation that the interior bag had ruptured is a significant and ominous development, suggesting that the previously slipped liver may have been irreparably damaged. The use of the word "ruptured" implies a catastrophic failure, which raises the stakes and creates a sense of dread for the outcome. The reader is likely to be on edge, wondering what the consequences of this development will be for Robert Bent's fate.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"9 When they opened the case, they discovered that the interior bag had ruptured."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the ninth paragraph an 8 out of 9.

Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph. 

(Note: The story is building up to a climactic conclusion, and the suspense is likely to reach a peak in the next paragraph.)
I would rate the suspensefulness of the tenth paragraph a 3 out of 9. The paragraph suggests that the medical team is taking a rational and scientific approach to assessing the damage, which reduces the sense of urgency and tension. The use of words like "biopsy" and "study" implies a more clinical and detached approach, which may alleviate some of the suspense that was built up in the previous paragraphs. However, the reader is still likely to be curious about the outcome of the biopsy and the condition of the liver, which keeps some level of suspense alive.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"10 The doctors took the case to the hepatic laboratory, where the surgeon responsible carried out a biopsy to study the condition of the organ."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the tenth paragraph a 3 out of 9.

Please go ahead and provide the next paragraph.

(Note: The story may be wrapping up, and the suspense may be decreasing as the outcome becomes clearer.)
I would rate the suspensefulness of the eleventh paragraph a 9 out of 9. The revelation that the liver was damaged beyond repair and cannot be used for the transplant is a catastrophic outcome that is likely to have a significant impact on Robert Bent's fate. The use of the word "impossible" to describe the organ's usability raises the stakes and creates a sense of finality, implying that all hope may be lost. The reader is likely to feel a strong sense of disappointment and despair in response to this news.
There is no preceding paragraph for me to rate. However, I recall that the previous paragraph was:

"11 The analysis showed that it had not withstood the impact and it was impossible to use the organ for the transplant."

I would rate the suspensefulness of the eleventh paragraph a 9 out of 9.

Note: The story has reached its climax, and the outcome is now clear. The remaining paragraphs will likely provide a resolution to the story.
I would rate the suspensefulness of the twelfth paragraph a 1 out of 9. The paragraph is a conclusion to the story, and the outcome is now clear. The tone is somber and sad, but the suspense has been resolved, and the reader is no longer wondering about the fate of Robert Bent. The use of the word "finally" implies a sense of closure, and the detailed timing of the event (21:26) provides a sense of realism, but the overall effect is one of sadness rather than suspense.
