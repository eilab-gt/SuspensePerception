I would rate the first paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up the scene and establishes the context for the story, but it's fairly straightforward and doesn't create a sense of tension or urgency.
Here are my ratings:

1. What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team verified that Robert Bent’s newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly, and had not been affected by the damage that it sustained in transit. This is the story of what happened.
 Suspensfulness: 2

The second paragraph adds some tension, as the medical team is waiting for the arrival of the organ and Robert's situation is critical. However, the outcome is ultimately positive, and the paragraph doesn't create a sense of danger or uncertainty. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which reduces the suspensefulness of the paragraph. 

 Suspensfulness: 2
I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a minor update on the situation, indicating that the helicopter arrived on time, but it doesn't create much tension or uncertainty. The use of "punctually" suggests a sense of efficiency, which reduces the sense of suspense. The outcome of the transplant is still uncertain, but the paragraph doesn't reveal any major complications or setbacks, which makes it a relatively non-suspensful paragraph.
I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

However, I should correct that there is no "3" in your original instructions, you asked me to rate each paragraph as a score out of 9, where 1 is "not suspensful" and 9 is "very suspensful".

So, I will correct my rating: 

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.
I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency, as the two men are racing against time to deliver the liver to Robert Bent. The description of the helicopter and the whirlwind of the spinning blades adds to the sense of energy and haste of the scene. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the tension is more related to the speed and efficiency of the delivery rather than a direct threat or danger.
I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

However, the arrival of the liver is now imminent, and the tone of the paragraph suggests that the main hurdle has been overcome. The critical situation of the patient is still mentioned, but it's not explicitly stated what the immediate consequences would be if the liver didn't arrive on time, which reduces the sense of tension.

The next paragraph would likely increase the suspensefulness score significantly, as the fate of Robert Bent and the success of the transplant would be revealed.
I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. This paragraph is a mundane and ordinary description of a cleaner's routine, and it doesn't create any sense of tension or uncertainty. The tone is calm and matter-of-fact, and there is no hint of anything out of the ordinary or unexpected. The mention of the cleaner finishing his job quickly and proceeding with his day is completely predictable and doesn't add to the suspense.
I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

The previous paragraph's low suspensefulness score was predictable, as it was a standard, non-descript description of a daily routine. The current paragraph's content seems unrelated to the main story and doesn't hint at any tension or suspense.
I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and raises some questions about what might happen next. The two men are now navigating the hospital's corridors and stairwells, and their conversation suggests that they're trying to move quickly. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The hint of time being of the essence and the possible consequences of delay adds a sense of urgency, but the tone is still relatively controlled and the threat is not explicitly stated.
I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

The conversation between the two men creates a sense of tension, but it's a relatively low-stakes conversation about navigating the hospital. The outcome of their decision to take the stairs rather than the lift is not explicitly threatening, and the tone of the conversation is calm and practical. The suspense is more related to the time constraint and the need for speed, rather than a direct threat or danger.
I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sudden and intense moment of tension as the man's foot slips and he loses his balance. The reader is left wondering if he will be able to regain his balance and catch the case, or if the contents of the case will be damaged or compromised. The use of vivid language, such as the sound of the case "sounding like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The horror of the situation is palpable, and the reader is left holding their breath, anticipating the outcome.
I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

The plot has taken a dramatic turn, and the reader is now invested in the outcome of the situation. The sudden and unexpected event (the man's foot slipping) creates a sense of tension and raises the stakes. The description of the case rolling down the stairs and making a loud noise adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The suspense is now much higher, and the reader is eager to know what happens next.
I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of relief that the case has stopped rolling down the stairs, but this is quickly replaced by a new sense of tension as the man is cautious about picking it up, fearing that it may have been damaged. The warning from his colleague to call the doctors adds to the sense of uncertainty, and the decision to wait for further instructions creates a sense of anticipation. The fact that one of the men is now leaving to alert the medical team adds to the sense of urgency, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next, particularly if the liver has been damaged or compromised.
I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

The paragraph builds on the tension from the previous paragraph, and the decision to call the doctors before handling the case adds to the sense of uncertainty. The fact that one of the men is leaving to alert the medical team creates a sense of anticipation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next, particularly if the liver has been damaged or compromised. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the outcome of the situation is still somewhat predictable, and the reader knows that the medical team will likely be able to mitigate any potential damage to the liver.
I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension as the colleague stands frozen beside the case, worrying about the possibility of damage. The use of vivid language, such as "trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall" and "overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange" adds to the sense of unease. However, the tension is somewhat alleviated by the arrival of the doctors, which suggests that the situation is about to be resolved. The paragraph is still engaging, but the outcome is somewhat predictable, and the suspense is not as high as it was in the previous paragraph.
I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

However, the arrival of the doctors seems to be a turning point in the story, and the doctor's instruction to "Move away, please" creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what the doctors will find when they examine the case, and whether the liver has been damaged. This slight increase in tension and uncertainty brings the suspensefulness score up slightly.
I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured and the liver has been damaged creates a sense of tension and disappointment. The use of vivid language, such as "a long split down one side" and "a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping" adds to the sense of unease. The reader is left wondering what this means for Robert Bent's chances of survival, and the outcome is now much more uncertain. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the consequences of the damaged liver are still somewhat implied rather than explicitly stated.
I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The revelation that the liver has been damaged is a major twist, and the reader is left wondering what this means for Robert Bent's survival. The use of vivid language and the image of the refrigerated air escaping adds to the sense of tension and urgency. The outcome is now highly uncertain, and the reader is on the edge of their seat, eager to know what will happen next. This is a classic example of a suspenseful plot twist that raises the stakes and creates a sense of tension.
I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The situation has reached a critical point, and the reader is on the edge of their seat as the surgeon prepares to perform a delicate and high-stakes procedure. The fact that the surgeon has "carried out numerous biopsies" but never had a child's life hanging in the balance adds to the sense of tension, as does the prospect of damaging the organ irreparably. The surgeon's nervousness is palpable, and the reader is left wondering if he will be able to succeed. The paragraph is a masterclass in building suspense, as the stakes are raised and the tension becomes almost unbearable.
I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

The paragraph has created a sense of high stakes and intense tension, as the surgeon prepares to perform a critical and potentially life-or-death procedure. The use of language, such as "child's life hanging in the balance", "one millimetre out", and "damage the organ irreparably", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is fully invested in the outcome, and the suspense is at a maximum level.
I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

The paragraph resolves the tension and suspense that was building in the previous paragraph, as the surgeon's biopsy is successful and the sample shows a favorable metabolic rate. The use of language, such as "interminable half a minute" and "anxiously awaiting the diagnosis", creates a sense of anticipation, but the outcome is now clear. The paragraph is more of a relief than a suspenseful moment, and the tension is now released. The surgeon's concern is more of a moment of mild drama than a true moment of suspense.
I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

However, I should note that the tone of the story has shifted significantly from being highly suspenseful to being more of a relief. The surgeon's successful biopsy and the favorable metabolic rate have essentially resolved the main plot point, and the story is now moving towards a more positive outcome. This shift in tone is quite dramatic, and it's interesting to see how the author has structured the story to create a sense of tension and then resolution.
I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

This paragraph is a conclusion to the story and provides a sense of resolution and relief. The fact that Robert's new liver is functioning correctly is a positive outcome, and the tension and suspense that built up throughout the story are now alleviated. The paragraph is more of a happy ending than a suspenseful moment, and the reader can finally breathe a sigh of relief.
