Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

2. Not suspenseful (1/9) - This paragraph is setting the scene for the story, and while it introduces some tension, it's still fairly mundane.

4. Not suspenseful (1/9) - This paragraph is more of a distraction from the main plot, and doesn't really add to the tension or suspense.

5. Suspenseful (6/9) - The conversation between the two men adds some tension, and the reader starts to wonder what will happen to the liver.

6. Very suspenseful (8/9) - The unexpected twist of the man's foot slipping and the case falling down the stairs is a sudden and intense moment of suspense.

7. Suspenseful (7/9) - The reader is left wondering what will happen to the liver and whether it has been damaged.

8. Very suspenseful (9/9) - The superstition of the colleague and his concern for the liver's condition add to the tension, and the reader is left with a sense of foreboding.

9. Very suspenseful (9/9) - The reveal that the fridge has ruptured and the liver is damaged is a shocking and intense moment of suspense.

10. Suspenseful (5/9) - The initial diagnosis and the transfer of the liver to the laboratory are somewhat tense, but the outcome is still uncertain.

11. Suspenseful (7/9) - The biopsy and the analysis of the sample are critical moments in the story, and the reader is left wondering whether the liver is still viable.

12. Very suspenseful (9/9) - The final outcome, the death of Robert Bent, is a tragic and intense conclusion to the story.
