Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2: This paragraph is more of a setup or an introduction, and it doesn't create much suspense on its own. It simply tells us that something dramatic is going to happen.

2. 2: This paragraph is also quite straightforward and doesn't raise much tension. It's just a report of a simple event (a helicopter landing).

3. 2: Again, this paragraph is a straightforward description of people doing their job. It's not particularly suspenseful.

4. 4: This paragraph raises a small question in the reader's mind - what will happen because the cleaner didn't put up a "wet floor" sign? But it's still a relatively minor detail.

5. 5: This paragraph introduces a bit more tension as the two men are walking down the stairs with a fragile case. The reader might start to wonder if something will go wrong.

6. 7: This is where things start to get more suspenseful. The man slips and the case plunges down the stairs, which raises the stakes and creates a sense of danger.

7. 8: The colleague's decision to stay supervising the case while his partner warns the doctors suggests that they're trying to contain the situation and prevent further problems.

8. 6: This paragraph is more of a confirmation that the situation is indeed serious, but it's not particularly suspenseful on its own.

9. 8: This paragraph raises the stakes further as the doctors open the case and discover the damage.

10. 6: The doctors take the case to a lab for analysis, which suggests that they're trying to figure out the extent of the damage.

11. 9: This paragraph is where the story really takes a dramatic turn. The analysis shows that the organ is unusable, and the reader knows that Robert's fate is now sealed.

12. 1: This final paragraph is more of a conclusion than a suspenseful event. It simply states what happened, but it's not particularly surprising or tense.
