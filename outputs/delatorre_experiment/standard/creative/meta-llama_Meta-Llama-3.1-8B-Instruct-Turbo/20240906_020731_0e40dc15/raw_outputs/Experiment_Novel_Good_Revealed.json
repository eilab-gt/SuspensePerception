Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

2. 2 (There's some tension building up, but nothing too dramatic yet)

3. 3 (The scene is set, but the tension is still relatively low)

4. 1 (This paragraph is almost mundane, which makes it a nice contrast to the drama that's to come)

5. 4 (The men are in a hurry, but nothing's really at stake yet)

6. 8 (This is where things start to go wrong, and the tension begins to rise)

7. 9 (The reader is left wondering if the liver was damaged, and the sense of urgency is palpable)

8. 8 (The man's superstition adds a psychological layer to the story, and his pain and worry add to the tension)

9. 9 (The reveal that the liver was damaged is dramatic, and the reader is on the edge of their seat)

10. 7 (The story takes a break from the immediate action, but the consequences of the damage are still being explored)

11. 8 (The surgeon's anxiety and tension are palpable, and the reader is on edge waiting for the diagnosis)

12. 4 (The resolution of the story is a relief, and the tension has dissipated)
