3. 4 - The description of the men getting out of the helicopter and the urgency of the situation creates some tension, but it's still a relatively routine scene.

4. 2 - This paragraph is more of a character sketch of the cleaner and doesn't contribute much to the overall suspense. It's a bit of a tangent from the main story.
