I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The detailed description of the scene, including the whirlwind from the helicopter blades and the men's movements, creates a sense of urgency and dynamic action.

The mention of the patient's critical situation and the need to hurry raises the stakes and creates a sense of anticipation, making the reader wonder if they will make it in time. However, the overall tone is more focused on conveying the urgency of the situation rather than creating a sense of uncertainty or danger, which prevents it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph is a mundane description of the cleaner's daily routine, with a focus on the details of his job and his thoughts about it. The tone is casual and matter-of-fact, with no hint of tension or urgency. The cleaner's whistling and lack of concern about the state of the stairwell further reinforce the sense of normalcy and routine. The only potential hint of something amiss is the mention of the lack of warning signs, but it's not emphasized or made to seem significant, so it doesn't contribute much to the overall sense of suspense. Overall, the paragraph feels like a digression or a pause in the story, rather than a buildup to something exciting or ominous.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 in terms of suspense.

The fact that they decide to take the stairs instead of the lift creates a sense of anticipation and adds to the sense of time pressure. However, the tone is still fairly matter-of-fact, and there's no hint of danger or unexpected complications, which keeps the suspense level from being too high. The situation feels more like a tense but manageable challenge rather than a potentially catastrophic one.
