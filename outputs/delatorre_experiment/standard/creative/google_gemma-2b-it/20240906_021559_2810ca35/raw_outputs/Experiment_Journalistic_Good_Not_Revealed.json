**Suspension:** 8/9

The passage provides a clear and concise account of the events leading up to and following the liver transplant for Robert Bent. The story is suspensful because it reveals a chain of events that could have potentially gone wrong, and the impact of these events on the patient's health is not immediately clear from the main narrative.
