2 The passage is very suspensful because it tells a tragic story of a child's life and the difficult decision that the medical team had to make. It is a very emotional story that will resonate with anyone who has ever had to deal with a loved one's illness or death.

3 The passage is moderately suspensful because it provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the death of Robert Bent. However, the passage is not as emotionally charged as the first paragraph.

4 The passage is not suspensful because it provides a general overview of the event without going into detail.
