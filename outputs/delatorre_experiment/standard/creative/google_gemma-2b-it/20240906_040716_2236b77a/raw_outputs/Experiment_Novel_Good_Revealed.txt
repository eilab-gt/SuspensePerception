On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital’s secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor.

The moment Robert Bent’s stomach received the liver it slid down into his abdomen, stomach and intestines jolting into life with the impact of the delivery. The pressure was intense but not unbearable. There was no immediate pain, just a dull ache that settled in the abdomen and spread down the leg. It was a relief, a necessary break from the intensity of the pre-operative stress.
