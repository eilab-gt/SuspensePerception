1 What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team verified that Robert Bent’s newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly, and had not been affected by the damage that it sustained in transit. This is the story of what happened.
