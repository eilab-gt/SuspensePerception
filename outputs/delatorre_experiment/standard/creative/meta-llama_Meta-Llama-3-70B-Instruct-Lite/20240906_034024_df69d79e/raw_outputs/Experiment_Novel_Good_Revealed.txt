I would rate the suspense level of the previous paragraph an 8. This paragraph is still very suspenseful, but slightly less so than the previous one. The tension has been slightly diffused by the fact that the case has stopped rolling and the men are now dealing with the aftermath. However, the sense of urgency and caution is still palpable, and the reader is still invested in the story. The mention of potential damage to the liver and the need to call the doctors adds to the sense of uncertainty and tension. The description of the man's careful descent down the stairs and his quick navigation of the hospital corridors also helps to maintain a sense of pace and tension.
