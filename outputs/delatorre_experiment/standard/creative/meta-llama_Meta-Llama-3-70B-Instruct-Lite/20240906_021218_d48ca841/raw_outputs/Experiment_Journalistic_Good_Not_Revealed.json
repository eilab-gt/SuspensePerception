Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 4 - The introduction sets the stage for an important event, but it's still just a setup, so it's not too suspenseful yet.

2. 2 - The arrival of the helicopter is a necessary step in the story, but it's a relatively mundane event, so it doesn't create much suspense.

3. 3 - The introduction of the liver and the two men creates a bit of anticipation, but it's still a fairly routine part of the story.

4. 1 - The mention of the cleaner is a minor detail that doesn't add much to the story, so it's not very suspenseful.

5. 5 - The decision to take the stairs creates a bit of tension, as it's an unusual choice, but it's still not clear what will happen.

6. 8 - The slip on the stairs is a sudden and unexpected event that creates a lot of tension and suspense.

7. 6 - The immediate reaction to the slip creates a sense of urgency, but the fact that the case is not handled until the doctors arrive reduces the suspense a bit.

8. 3 - The prompt arrival of the doctors is a relief, but it's still not clear what will happen to the organ.

9. 7 - The discovery of the ruptured bag is a new complication that creates tension and suspense.

10. 4 - The biopsy is a necessary step, but it's a bit of a pause in the action, so the suspense level drops a bit.

11. 5 - The analysis creates a bit of tension as the reader waits to hear the result, but it's still a relatively minor part of the story.

12. 2 - The final resolution is a relief, but it's not very suspenseful, as the story is wrapping up.
