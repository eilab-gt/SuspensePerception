I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale.

1. **4**: The paragraph sets the scene and provides some background information, but it doesn't create much suspense. The fact that the story is based on a real event might pique the reader's interest, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

2. **3**: This paragraph introduces the helicopter and the arrival of the liver, but it's still a relatively calm and straightforward scene. There's no sense of danger or urgency yet.

3. **5**: The two men's haste and the critical condition of the patient start to create a sense of urgency and tension. The description of the hospital's layout also helps to build a sense of setting.

4. **2**: The introduction of the cleaner and his mundane task provides a brief respite from the tension. This paragraph is quite calm and doesn't contribute much to the suspense.

5. **4**: The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the lift creates a sense of urgency, and the description of the hospital's layout continues to build the setting. However, the paragraph is still relatively calm.

6. **8**: The man's foot slipping on the stairs and the case rolling down creates a sudden and intense moment of suspense. The description of the sound of the case rolling down the stairs is particularly effective in creating tension.

7. **7**: The men's reactions to the case's fall and their decision to call the doctors create a sense of panic and urgency. The suspense is building as the reader wonders if the liver has been damaged.

8. **6**: The man's reluctance to move and his superstition about the liver's condition create a sense of tension and foreboding. The sound of the doctors rushing up the stairs adds to the suspense.

9. **9**: The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured creates a peak moment of suspense. The reader is on edge, wondering if the liver is still usable.

10. **5**: The paragraph is more procedural, describing the medical team's examination of the liver. While it's still suspenseful, it's not as intense as the previous paragraph.

11. **8**: The surgeon's nervousness and the description of the biopsy procedure create a sense of tension and suspense. The reader is invested in the outcome and worried about the potential risks.

12. **2**: The final paragraph is more of a conclusion, wrapping up
