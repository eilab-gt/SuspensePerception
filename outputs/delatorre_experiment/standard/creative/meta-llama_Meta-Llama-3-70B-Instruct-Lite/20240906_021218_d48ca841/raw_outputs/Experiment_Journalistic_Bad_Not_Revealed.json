I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested.

1. This paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context for the story. It's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage, so I'd rate it a 2.

2. This paragraph is still building up to the main event, and the arrival of the helicopter is a crucial step in the story. However, it's still a fairly neutral passage, so I'd rate it a 3.

3. The introduction of the liver and the "small blue fridge" adds a bit of tension, as we know how crucial the organ is to Robert's survival. I'd rate this a 5.

4. This paragraph seems a bit out of place, as it focuses on the cleaner and the "wet floor" sign. It's a subtle hint at what's to come, but it's still a relatively calm passage, so I'd rate it a 4.

5. The decision to take the service stairwell adds a bit of tension, as it creates a sense of uncertainty. I'd rate this a 6.

6. This is where the suspense really starts to build. The slip on the stairs and the case plunging down creates a sense of chaos and urgency. I'd rate this an 8.

7. The immediate reaction of the colleague and the person supervising the case adds to the tension, as we're worried about the fate of the liver. I'd rate this an 8 as well.

8. The prompt arrival of the doctors is a bit of a relief, but we're still worried about the liver, so I'd rate this a 7.

9. The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured is a major plot twist, and the suspense is very high at this point. I'd rate this a 9.

10. The biopsy and analysis are a bit of a slow burn, but we're still worried about the outcome, so I'd rate this an 8.

11. The confirmation that the organ is damaged beyond use is devastating, and the suspense is still very high. I'd rate this a 9.

12. The final paragraph is more of a tragic conclusion than a suspenseful passage, but it's still a very impactful ending. I'd rate this an 8.

Overall, the suspense builds throughout the story, with the most intense moments around paragraphs 6-9.
