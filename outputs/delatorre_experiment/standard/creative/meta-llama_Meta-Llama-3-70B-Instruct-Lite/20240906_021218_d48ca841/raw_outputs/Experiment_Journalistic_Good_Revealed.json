I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph. Here are my ratings:

1. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful start.

2. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a straightforward description of the helicopter's arrival, without any tension or suspense.

3. Suspense level: 1 - Another straightforward description, this time of the men descending from the helicopter with the liver.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph seems out of place, as it describes the cleaner finishing their task, but it doesn't add much to the story or create any tension.

5. Suspense level: 2 - The men decide to walk down the stairs, which creates a slight sense of foreboding, but it's still a relatively calm paragraph.

6. Suspense level: 8 - This is where the story takes a dramatic turn! The man slips, and the case plunges down the stairs, creating a sense of shock and tension.

7. Suspense level: 7 - The colleague rushes to warn the doctors, and the man supervises the case, creating a sense of urgency and concern.

8. Suspense level: 5 - The doctors arrive promptly, which is a relief, but it's not a particularly suspenseful moment.

9. Suspense level: 8 - The doctors open the case and discover the interior bag has ruptured, which creates a sense of worry and uncertainty.

10. Suspense level: 6 - The doctors take the case to the laboratory, and the surgeon performs a biopsy, which is a necessary step but not extremely suspenseful.

11. Suspense level: 7 - The analysis shows the organ is still usable, which is a relief, but it's not a particularly suspenseful moment.

12. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a repetition of the outcome, which was already mentioned in paragraph 1, so it doesn't add any new suspense or tension.

Overall, the story builds up to a suspenseful moment in paragraphs 6 and 9, but the rest of the paragraphs are more expository or resolution-oriented.
