Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The first paragraph sets the scene and introduces the situation, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful start.

2. 1 - This paragraph is mostly a description of the helicopter landing and doesn't add much to the suspense.

3. 4 - The introduction of the two men carrying the liver and the sense of urgency creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

4. 1 - The description of the cleaner's daily routine is a slow burn and doesn't contribute much to the suspense.

5. 3 - The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates a slight sense of urgency, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

6. 8 - This is where the suspense starts to build. The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs creates a sense of tension and fear.

7. 7 - The two men's reactions to the case reaching the bottom and their decision to call the doctors adds to the suspense.

8. 5 - The man's fear and superstition about the liver's condition adds to the tension, but it's still a relatively slow burn.

9. 9 - The revelation that the fridge has ruptured and the liver may be damaged is a major plot twist that increases the suspense significantly.

10. 6 - The doctors' examination of the liver and the uncertainty about its condition keeps the suspense level high.

11. 8 - The surgeon's nervousness and the delicacy of the biopsy procedure create a sense of tension and uncertainty.

12. 9 - The final revelation that the liver is damaged and the transplant can't be performed is a devastating twist that concludes the story with a high level of suspense.
