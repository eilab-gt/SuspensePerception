Here are my ratings for the suspensefulness of each paragraph:

1. **Suspense: 4** - Introduces a high-stakes situation (liver transplant, critical condition) but doesn't yet create immediate tension.

2. **Suspense: 5** - The arrival of the helicopter and the urgency of the situation start to build suspense.

3. **Suspense: 6** - The details about the liver's transport (small case, blue fridge) create a sense of fragility and potential danger.

4. **Suspense: 7** - This seemingly mundane detail (missing "wet floor" sign) foreshadows a potential disaster.

5. **Suspense: 8** -  The decision to use the stairwell and the mention of the case being carried increase the potential for something bad to happen.

6. **Suspense: 9** - The slip and the case plunging down the stairs is the peak of the suspense, creating a nail-biting moment.

7. **Suspense: 8** -  The brief separation of the men and the focus on the case's precarious state maintain the tension.

8. **Suspense: 7** - The doctors' arrival offers a glimmer of hope but doesn't completely alleviate the suspense.

9. **Suspense: 9** - The suspense reaches a critical point as the bag is opened and the potential for disaster is revealed.

10. **Suspense: 6** - The move to the lab offers a slight decrease in tension as a solution is sought.

11. **Suspense: 8** - The diagnosis of the organ's damage raises the stakes and brings back the fear for Robert.

12. **Suspense: 5** - The tragic outcome brings a sense of closure but lessens the immediate suspense.
