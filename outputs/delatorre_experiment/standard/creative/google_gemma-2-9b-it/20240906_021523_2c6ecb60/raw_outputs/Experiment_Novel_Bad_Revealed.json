Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **3/9:**  The introduction sets up a potential conflict but doesn't immediately evoke strong suspense. 
2. **5/9:**  The arrival of the organ and the mention of the patient's critical condition start to raise the stakes.
3. **7/9:**  The focus on the men's urgency and the details of their descent heighten the sense of tension. 
4. **1/9:** This paragraph is a complete diversion and feels unrelated to the central narrative, reducing suspense.
5. **6/9:**  The decision to take the stairs and the mention of the patient being on the 6th floor build anticipation.
6. **8/9:** The fall of the case is a major plot point that creates a lot of suspense.
7. **7/9:** The worry over potential damage and the colleague's  superstition add to the tension.
8. **6/9:**  The arrival of the doctors and the focus on the case's condition keep the suspense going.
9. **9/9:** This is the peak of suspense. The doctor's inspection and the reveal that the liver is damaged is incredibly intense.
10. **8/9:** The description of the biopsy and the surgeon's nervousness maintain the high level of suspense.
11. **9/9:** The moment of truth arrives, and the confirmation of the liver's deterioration is devastating.
12. **3/9:**  The ending, while tragic, is a bit anticlimactic after the build-up.
