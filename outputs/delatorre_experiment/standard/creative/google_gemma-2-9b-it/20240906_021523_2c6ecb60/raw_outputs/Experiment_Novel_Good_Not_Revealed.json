Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. **2/9** -  It's intriguing that a real event is being described, but it lacks immediate suspense. We know a transplant is happening, but there's no sense of urgency yet. 

2. **4/9** - The arrival of the organ heightens the tension.  We know time is critical, and the helicopter landing adds a sense of drama.

3. **6/9** - This paragraph increases the suspense significantly. We see the urgency of the situation, the difficult conditions, and the risk of losing precious time.

4. **1/9** - This paragraph is a diversion, focusing on the cleaner and his mundane routine. It breaks the momentum of the rising suspense.

5. **5/9** -  The mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a new layer of tension. We're anticipating potential problems.

6. **8/9** -  This is the most suspenseful paragraph. The man slipping, the case falling, and the two men's horrified reaction create a nail-biting moment.

7. **7/9** - The suspense continues as we see the consequences of the fall and the decision to call for help.

8. **4/9** -  The arrival of the doctors provides some relief, but the suspense remains about the condition of the liver.

9. **9/9** - This is the peak of suspense. The doctor's inspection, the potential for irreparable damage, and the desperate hope for the liver to be salvageable make for a gripping moment.

10. **6/9** -  The suspense is still high as the examination begins, but the focus shifts to the technical process.

11. **5/9** -  The tension builds again as the surgeon performs the biopsy and analyzes the sample. 

12. **3/9** - The relief at the successful outcome brings the story to a satisfying conclusion but reduces the suspense.
