Here are my ratings for each paragraph's suspense level:

1. **3/9** -  Intriguing setup, but not yet suspenseful. It lays the groundwork for a tense situation but doesn't deliver immediate tension.

2. **4/9** -  The arrival of the organ and the urgency implied by the helicopter add a slight sense of anticipation.

3. **6/9** -  The description of the delivery team and their hurried actions heightens the tension. The focus on time and the "critical" situation create some suspense.

4. **2/9** -  A bit of a lull in the suspense. The mundane details of the cleaner's work contrast with the urgency of the situation.

5. **5/9** -  The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a layer of potential risk.  

6. **8/9** - The fall and the impact on the case create a major turning point and a strong sense of suspense. The fear of damage to the organ is palpable.

7. **7/9** -  The tension continues as they await the assessment of the damaged case.  The uncertainty of the situation keeps the reader on edge.

8. **6/9** -  The arrival of the doctors and the examination of the organ build suspense as they try to determine its viability.

9. **9/9** - This is the peak of suspense. The doctor's uncertainty, the delicate procedure, and the life-or-death stakes create immense tension.

10. **7/9** - The focus on the meticulous process of examining the liver keeps the suspense going, even though we know the outcome.

11. **8/9** -  The relief at the positive diagnosis is palpable, making this a very suspenseful paragraph.

12. **2/9** -  The resolution of the story brings the suspense to an end.
