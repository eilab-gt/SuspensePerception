Here are my ratings for the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. **Suspense:** 6 -  The setup introduces a high-stakes situation with a time constraint and a vulnerable patient. 
2. **Suspense:** 4 -  The arrival of the helicopter and organ raises the stakes, but it's still somewhat procedural.
3. **Suspense:** 3 - This paragraph is more descriptive than suspenseful.
4. **Suspense:** 5 -  This is where the story starts to introduce potential danger. The missing "wet floor" sign foreshadows a potential accident.
5. **Suspense:** 6 -  The decision to use the service stairwell heightens the sense of risk.
6. **Suspense:** 8 -  The slip and the falling case are a dramatic turning point.
7. **Suspense:** 7 -  The split action (one man alerting the doctors, the other staying with the case) creates tension.
8. **Suspense:** 6 - The prompt arrival of the doctors is a relief but also adds to the urgency.
9. **Suspense:** 8 -  The moment of truth arrives with the opening of the case. 
10. **Suspense:** 5 -  The biopsy adds another layer of uncertainty.
11. **Suspense:** 9 -  The revelation that the organ is damaged is the highest point of suspense.
12. **Suspense:** 3 -  The final confirmation of Robert's death brings a sense of tragedy, but the suspense has largely dissipated.
