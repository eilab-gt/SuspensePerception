I'd rate the first paragraph a **6/9** in terms of suspense. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The story immediately establishes a serious situation with Robert's life hanging in the balance. A liver transplant is a major surgery with inherent risks.
* **Time Pressure:** The "imminent transplant" and the fact that Robert's condition is critical create a sense of urgency. 
* **Uncertainty:**  We know a donor has been found, but there's a question of whether Robert will survive until the transplant.


Let me know when you're ready for the next paragraph!

* **Arrival:**  The helicopter arriving with the organ adds a dramatic element and brings the possibility of success closer.
* **Contrast:** The statement "Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition" creates a tension between hope and the ongoing danger. 




What's next?

I'd rate the fourth paragraph a 2/9. 

This paragraph is a stark contrast to the tension building in the previous ones. It's a very detailed and mundane account of a cleaner's routine.  While it's well-written, it lacks suspense and feels disconnected from the main storyline.  



I'm curious how this seemingly irrelevant detail will connect back to the story.  Will the cleaner's routine become important somehow?

* **Spatial Detail:**  The descriptions of the corridor, the archives, and the lift create a sense of direction and movement, pulling us further into the scene.


It's clear that every moment counts now!

I'm hooked! I'm ready for the next installment.  Bring on the suspense!
