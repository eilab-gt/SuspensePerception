Suspense level: **5**

The paragraph sets up a situation with potential danger (Robert's critical condition) and an impending event (the liver transplant). The mention of a suitable donor and the uncertainty of his survival create some anticipation, but it's not overwhelmingly suspenseful yet. 



Please provide the next paragraph so I can rate the suspense level!  😊  

Suspense level: **6**

The arrival of the helicopter and the specific time add a sense of urgency and  heighten the anticipation. We know something important is happening, but we don't know the outcome yet.  


Let me know the next paragraph when you're ready!  

Okay, I'm ready for the next paragraph! 😊
