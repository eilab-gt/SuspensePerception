That paragraph was quite suspenseful! 

I'd rate it a **7**.  

Here's why: 

* **High Stakes:**  A life-or-death situation is inherently suspenseful. The reader knows Robert's condition is critical and depends on the transplant.
* **Ticking Clock:**  The time elements (8 a.m., 21:26) create a sense of urgency and impending doom.
* **Uncertain Outcome:**  The paragraph leaves the reader hanging on the question of whether the transplant will be successful.

I'd rate that paragraph a **6**. 

Here's why:

* **Continued Urgency:**  The specific time keeps the sense of urgency going. It feels like things are moving fast.
