I found the fourth paragraph to be a **2/9** on the suspense scale. 

Here's why:

* **Slow Pace:** The detailed description of the cleaning process lacks a sense of urgency or impending danger.
* **Unrelated Plot:** The cleaner's story seems unrelated to the main plot about the liver transplant, making it feel like a distraction rather than a contributing element to the suspense.
