Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 6 - The paragraph sets up a critical situation and creates tension by mentioning that Robert's situation is critical and that the medical team is racing against time. However, it also gives away the outcome, which reduces the suspense.

2. 4 - This paragraph is more of a setup, establishing the scene and the characters. It's a calm and peaceful description, which doesn't create much suspense.

3. 7 - The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and importance, emphasizing that the characters have no time to lose. The description of the helicopter and the men rushing to deliver the organ adds to the tension.

4. 2 - This paragraph is a calm and mundane description of the cleaner's daily routine. It doesn't create any suspense and seems out of place in the story.

5. 5 - The paragraph sets up the scene and establishes the characters' intentions. It's a neutral description that doesn't create much suspense.

6. 9 - This paragraph is where the suspense really kicks in. The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs creates a sense of chaos and unpredictability.

7. 8 - The paragraph continues the suspense from the previous one, with the characters holding their breath and watching in horror as the case rolls down the stairs. The uncertainty of the liver's condition adds to the tension.

8. 6 - The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and worry, as the characters wait to see if the liver has been damaged. The description of the man's pain and superstition adds to the tension.

9. 8 - The paragraph is suspenseful because it reveals the damage to the case and the uncertainty of the liver's condition. The doctor's reaction and the description of the damaged fridge add to the tension.

10. 7 - The paragraph creates a sense of hope and uncertainty, as the medical team examines the liver and waits for the results of the biopsy. The description of the surgeon's nervousness adds to the tension.

11. 9 - This paragraph is extremely suspenseful, with the surgeon performing a delicate procedure and the outcome hanging in the balance. The description of his nervousness and the uncertainty of the result add to the tension.

12. 1 - The paragraph is not suspenseful because it's a conclusion that we already knew was coming. The outcome is already established, and the paragraph is more of a sad resolution than a suspenseful climax.
