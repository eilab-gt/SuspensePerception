I'll rate each paragraph for suspense.

1. This paragraph sets the stage for the story and creates a sense of anticipation and tension. The fact that Robert's situation is critical and they're waiting for the organ creates a sense of urgency. Suspense level: 6

2. This paragraph is more of a transition, providing information about the arrival of the helicopter. It's a necessary step in the story but doesn't add much suspense. Suspense level: 2

3. This paragraph is similar to the previous one, providing more details about the organ and its transportation. It's still a relatively calm part of the story. Suspense level: 2

4. This paragraph introduces a potential hazard (the wet floor) but doesn't create much tension yet, as the reader doesn't know what will happen next. Suspense level: 3

5. This paragraph sets the stage for the accident, but the reader still doesn't know what will happen. The decision to use the service stairwell creates a sense of foreboding. Suspense level: 5

6. This paragraph is where the suspense really kicks in. The accident happens, and the reader is left wondering if the liver is damaged and if Robert's transplant will be successful. Suspense level: 8

7. This paragraph creates more tension as the reader waits to find out what will happen to the liver and if it's still usable. The fact that the doctors haven't arrived yet adds to the suspense. Suspense level: 8

8. This paragraph is a quick transition, and the reader is still waiting to find out what will happen to the liver. The prompt arrival of the doctors creates a sense of relief, but the suspense is still there. Suspense level: 6

9. This paragraph is a turning point in the story. The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured creates a sense of dread and raises questions about the liver's viability. Suspense level: 8

10. This paragraph creates more tension as the reader waits for the results of the biopsy. The fact that the surgeon is studying the condition of the organ creates a sense of uncertainty. Suspense level: 8

11. This paragraph provides a sense of relief, as the analysis shows that the liver is still usable. The suspense starts to dissipate. Suspense level: 4

12. This final paragraph resolves the story, and the reader finds out that the transplant was successful
