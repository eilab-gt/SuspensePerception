Here are my ratings for the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. 6 - The paragraph sets up a tense situation, with a child's life hanging in the balance, but it's more of a setup than an actively suspenseful moment.

2. 3 - This paragraph is mostly just a description of the helicopter landing, and doesn't add much to the tension.

3. 7 - The sense of urgency and the importance of the liver's safe transport start to build tension here.

4. 2 - This paragraph is a bit of a detour from the main action, and is more of a character sketch of the cleaner. It doesn't add much to the suspense.

5. 4 - The decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates a bit of tension, but it's not a major plot point.

6. 9 - The accident with the case creates a lot of tension and raises the stakes, making this a very suspenseful moment.

7. 8 - The aftermath of the accident is still tense, as the characters (and the reader) wait to find out if the liver has been damaged.

8. 6 - The character's superstition and pain add to the tension, but the paragraph is mostly just a character moment.

9. 8 - The reveal that the case has been damaged is a tense moment, and raises the stakes for the transplant.

10. 7 - The uncertainty about the liver's condition creates tension, but the paragraph is mostly just a description of the medical procedures.

11. 9 - The surgeon's nervousness and the high stakes of the biopsy create a very tense moment.

12. 1 - The resolution of the story is a relief, and the tension is finally released.
