This paragraph is not suspenseful at all. It's a mundane description of a cleaner's daily routine, with no hint of tension or conflict. The tone is calm and matter-of-fact, and the details about the service stairwell and the cleaner's preferences for cleaning corridors are more likely to induce boredom than suspense. The contrast between this paragraph and the previous one, which was building up to a critical medical situation, is quite stark.

This paragraph creates some sense of urgency and time pressure, as the characters are trying to reach the patient as quickly as possible. The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds to the sense of haste, and the mention of the patient's location on the 6th floor creates a sense of distance that needs to be overcome. However, the paragraph is still fairly procedural and doesn't create extreme suspense, as the characters are simply making a practical decision to get to their destination quickly. The tension is building, but it's still relatively low-key.

This paragraph is still very suspenseful, as the situation is still critical and the outcome is uncertain. The fact that the case may be damaged and the organ may be compromised raises the stakes, and the tension is palpable. The men's cautious and urgent actions, such as not touching the case and rushing to alert the medical team, add to the sense of urgency. However, the paragraph is slightly less suspenseful than the previous one, as the immediate danger of the case rolling down the stairs has passed, and the focus shifts to the aftermath and the potential consequences. The tension is still high, but it's more of a sustained, anxious tension rather than a sudden, shocking one.
