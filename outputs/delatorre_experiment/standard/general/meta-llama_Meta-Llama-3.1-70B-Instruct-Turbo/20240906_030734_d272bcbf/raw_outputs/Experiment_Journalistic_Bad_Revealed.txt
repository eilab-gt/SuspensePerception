I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph a 6. The paragraph sets up a critical situation with a child in need of a liver transplant, and the uncertainty of the outcome creates tension. However, the fact that the outcome is already revealed (the child's death) somewhat reduces the suspense. The paragraph effectively creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what happened to the organ in transit, but the overall impact is somewhat muted by the knowledge of the tragic outcome.
