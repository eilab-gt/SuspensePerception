Suspense rating: 6

The paragraph provides a sense of progression and timing, which creates a sense of anticipation. The fact that the helicopter landed "punctually" suggests that things are going according to plan, which slightly reduces the suspense. However, the fact that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" still maintains some level of tension, as the reader is aware that his situation is precarious. The suspense is moderate, but the lack of any unexpected events or complications keeps it from being higher.
