The paragraph is a stark contrast to the previous ones, which were filled with tension and urgency. This paragraph is a mundane and descriptive passage about the cleaner's routine, which is deliberately portrayed as uneventful and ordinary. The focus on the cleaner's thoughts and actions creates a sense of normalcy and routine, which is the opposite of suspenseful. The lack of any conflict or tension makes this paragraph feel like a calm and peaceful interlude, which is a deliberate departure from the suspenseful tone of the previous paragraphs.

The paragraph is a return to the story of the liver transplant, and it creates a sense of urgency and time sensitivity. The mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a sense of haste and importance. However, the paragraph is still quite descriptive and focused on the logistics of the hospital layout, which reduces the overall suspense level. The tension is building, but it's not yet at a critical point. The use of the word "realising" and the colleague's shrug also adds a sense of normalcy to the situation, which tempers the suspense.

The arrival of the doctors and the request to move away creates a sense of anticipation and raises the stakes. The fact that the doctors are finally there to assess the situation and take control reduces the suspense level slightly, but the uncertainty about the liver's condition and the outcome of the transplant operation keeps the tension high.

The use of the phrase "a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping" creates a sense of slow-motion disaster, adding to the tension. The suspense level is at its highest point in the story so far, as the reader is left wondering if the liver is still viable and if the transplant can still proceed.
