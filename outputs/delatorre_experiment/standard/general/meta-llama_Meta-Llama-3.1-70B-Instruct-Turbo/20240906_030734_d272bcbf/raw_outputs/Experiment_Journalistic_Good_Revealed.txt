Suspense rating: 4

The paragraph is more descriptive and procedural, focusing on the details of the scene rather than creating tension or suspense. The image of the two men descending from the helicopter and carrying a small blue fridge is more matter-of-fact than suspenseful, and doesn't add much to the overall sense of tension or urgency.

Suspense rating: 8

The paragraph is still suspenseful, as the reader is left wondering if the liver has been damaged during the fall, and what the consequences will be for the transplant. However, the fact that the colleague has gone to warn the doctors and the man is supervising the case suggests that the situation is being taken care of, and that the medical team is being alerted to the potential problem. This slightly reduces the level of suspense, but the uncertainty about the liver's condition still keeps the reader on edge.

Suspense rating: 2

The paragraph is not very suspenseful, as it simply states that the doctors arrived promptly, without providing any information about the condition of the liver or the outcome of the situation. The sense of urgency and tension that was built up in the previous paragraphs is somewhat dissipated, and the reader is left waiting for more information about what happens next. The prompt arrival of the doctors suggests that the situation is being handled efficiently, but the lack of detail makes the paragraph feel more like a transition than a suspenseful moment.

However, the paragraph is more procedural and less dramatic than the previous one, which slightly reduces the level of suspense.
