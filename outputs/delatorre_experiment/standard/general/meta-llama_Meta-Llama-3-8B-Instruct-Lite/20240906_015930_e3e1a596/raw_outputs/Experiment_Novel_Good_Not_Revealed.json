Here are the suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2/9 (This paragraph is more of an introduction, setting the stage for the story. It's not very suspenseful.)

2. 4/9 (The arrival of the helicopter and the organ is a significant event, but it's not particularly suspenseful on its own.)

3. 5/9 (The scene is starting to get more intense, with the two men rushing to get the organ to the patient, but it's still not very suspenseful.)

4. 2/9 (This paragraph is a bit of a non-sequitur, introducing a random character and his mundane job. It's not very suspenseful at all.)

5. 6/9 (The scene is starting to get more tense, with the men rushing to get the organ to the patient, and the mention of the patient's critical condition is starting to raise the stakes.)

6. 8/9 (This is where the story starts to get really suspenseful. The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a dramatic and intense moment.)

7. 9/9 (The men's reactions to the case being damaged are very suspenseful, and the reader is left wondering if the liver is still viable.)

8. 8/9 (The doctor's initial examination of the case is suspenseful, and the reader is left wondering if the liver is damaged.)

9. 9/9 (The doctor's examination of the liver is very suspenseful, with the reader wondering if the liver is still viable and if the patient will survive.)

10. 7/9 (The medical team's examination of the liver is suspenseful, but the reader is starting to get a sense that everything might be okay.)

11. 8/9 (The surgeon's biopsy is suspenseful, with the reader wondering if he will damage the liver and if the patient will survive.)

12. 9/9 (The final resolution of the story is very suspenseful, with the reader relieved that the liver is functioning correctly and the patient is going to survive.)
