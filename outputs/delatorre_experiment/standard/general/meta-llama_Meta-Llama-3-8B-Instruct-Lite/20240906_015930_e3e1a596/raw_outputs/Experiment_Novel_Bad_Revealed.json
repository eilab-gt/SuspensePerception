Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2/9 (This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's not very suspenseful yet.)

2. 3/9 (The arrival of the helicopter and the medical team is mildly exciting, but it's not particularly suspenseful.)

3. 4/9 (The scene with the two men getting out of the helicopter and moving towards the hospital is somewhat tense, but it's not very suspenseful yet.)

4. 1/9 (This paragraph is just a description of a mundane cleaning job and is not suspenseful at all.)

5. 5/9 (The scene with the two men discussing the patient's condition and the need to get to the 6th floor is somewhat tense, but it's not very suspenseful yet.)

6. 8/9 (The moment when the man carrying the case slips and the case rolls down the stairs is quite suspenseful, as it creates a sense of uncertainty and danger.)

7. 9/9 (The scene where the two men are kneeling down beside the case, looking at each other in horror, is extremely suspenseful, as it's clear that something has gone terribly wrong.)

8. 7/9 (The scene where the man who was in charge of the case goes to get the doctors, while his colleague stays with the case, is somewhat suspenseful, as it creates a sense of urgency and danger.)

9. 8/9 (The scene where the doctor opens the case and finds that the liver has been damaged is very suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tragedy and loss.)

10. 4/9 (This paragraph is a summary of the diagnosis and treatment, and is not very suspenseful.)

11. 6/9 (The scene where the surgeon is about to perform a biopsy is somewhat tense, but it's not very suspenseful yet.)

12. 9/9 (The final scene, where the medical team certifies Robert's death, is extremely suspenseful, as it's clear that the outcome is tragic and devastating.)
