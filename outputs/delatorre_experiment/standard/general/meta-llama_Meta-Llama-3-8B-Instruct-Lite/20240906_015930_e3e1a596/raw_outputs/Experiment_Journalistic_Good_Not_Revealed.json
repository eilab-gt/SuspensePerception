Here are my ratings for the preceding paragraphs:

1. 2 (not very suspensful) - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's just an introduction and doesn't have any suspenseful elements.

2. 3 (slightly suspensful) - The arrival of the helicopter and the men carrying the organ creates some anticipation, but it's still a fairly straightforward and calm scene.

3. 4 (slightly suspensful) - The introduction of the small blue fridge case storing the liver adds a bit of intrigue, but it's still not very suspenseful.

4. 1 (not suspensful) - This paragraph is just a routine detail about the cleaner and the "wet floor" sign.

5. 5 (somewhat suspensful) - The decision to walk down the stairs instead of taking the elevator creates some tension, and the reader might wonder what could go wrong.

6. 8 (very suspensful) - The man's slip and the case's plunge down the stairs is a dramatic and intense moment, making the reader wonder what will happen to the liver.

7. 6 (somewhat suspensful) - The doctor's prompt arrival and the man's decision to stay with the case creates some tension, but it's not as intense as the previous moment.

8. 4 (slightly suspensful) - The opening of the case and the discovery of the ruptured bag creates some concern, but it's not as intense as the previous moments.

9. 5 (somewhat suspensful) - The biopsy and analysis of the organ's condition creates some tension, as the reader wonders if the liver is still usable.

10. 1 (not suspensful) - This paragraph is just a routine update on Robert's condition, and it's not very suspenseful.

11. 2 (not suspensful) - The final confirmation that the liver is functioning correctly is a positive outcome, and it's not very suspenseful.
