Here are my ratings for the preceding paragraphs:

1. Not suspensful (1/9) - This is an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the story, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

2. 4/9 - This paragraph introduces the arrival of the helicopter and the medical team, which is somewhat suspenseful, but it's still a relatively calm and controlled scene.

3. 5/9 - The introduction of the two men and the blue case is somewhat ominous, and the fact that they're in a hurry adds to the tension. However, it's still a relatively calm and controlled scene.

4. 2/9 - This paragraph is more of a slow-paced, mundane description of a hospital cleaner's daily routine. It's not very suspenseful at all.

5. 6/9 - The introduction of the helipad exit and the service stairwell is a bit more suspenseful, as it sets up the possibility of something going wrong. However, it's still a relatively calm and controlled scene.

6. 8/9 - This is where things start to get more suspenseful. The cleaner's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a dramatic and potentially catastrophic event.

7. 9/9 - This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The two men are in a state of panic, and the reader is left wondering if the case has been damaged and if the liver is still viable.

8. 9/9 - The fact that the doctor is hesitant to touch the case and the possibility that the liver may be damaged is extremely suspenseful.

9. 8/9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the possibility that the liver may be damaged is still suspenseful, but it's not as intense as the previous paragraphs.

10. 6/9 - This paragraph is more of a calm and controlled description of the medical team's actions, but it's still somewhat suspenseful given the gravity of the situation.

11. 7/9 - The surgeon's nervousness and the possibility that he may damage the liver is suspenseful, but it's not as intense as the previous paragraphs.

12. 9/9 - The final paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as the reader is left wondering if the liver transplant will be successful and if Robert will survive. The fact that the liver is damaged and the transplant is cancelled is a devastating conclusion.
