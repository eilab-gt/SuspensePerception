2 What happened next was a miracle. The medical team was ecstatic, and the atmosphere in the operating room was electric. But little did they know that this was not the end of the story. The liver had been damaged during transportation, and it was a ticking time bomb. The team was on high alert, monitoring Robert's condition closely, waiting for the first signs of rejection. And then, at 2:15 a.m. the next morning, disaster struck. The liver began to fail, and Robert's condition rapidly deteriorated. The medical team was in a state of panic, trying to save him, but it seemed like all hope was lost.
