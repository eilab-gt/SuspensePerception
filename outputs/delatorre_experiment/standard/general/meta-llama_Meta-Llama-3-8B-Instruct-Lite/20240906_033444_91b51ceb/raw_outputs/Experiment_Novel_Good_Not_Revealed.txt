2. What happened next was a series of events that would change the course of their day, and possibly the course of Robert's life. At 8:30 a.m., the hospital's liver transplant team received a call from the organ procurement organization, saying that the donor liver had been transported to the hospital and was ready for implantation. The team sprang into action, preparing the operating room and gathering the necessary equipment. But just as they were about to begin the procedure, they were told that the liver was not suitable for Robert. The team was stunned, and the waiting game was back on.
