I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the preparation for a liver transplant and the urgency of the situation. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the medical team's readiness and the critical condition of the patient, adds to the sense of tension. The revelation that the organ arrived damaged and the patient ultimately died is a shocking twist that is likely to surprise and engage the reader. However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of build-up or cliffhanger, which might prevent it from reaching a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the arrival of the helicopter and the organ, which is a crucial moment in the story. The use of a specific time, 08:57, adds to the sense of realism and makes the scene feel more immediate. However, the paragraph is relatively short and lacks a strong sense of conflict or danger, which might prevent it from reaching a higher level of suspense. The phrase "critical but stable condition" also suggests that the situation is not as dire as it could be, which reduces the sense of tension. Overall, the paragraph is building up to something, but it is not yet fully engaging.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph is highly effective in building tension and suspense, as it creates a sense of urgency and danger. The use of vivid details, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "blue case" being carried by one of the men, creates a sense of intensity and importance. The fact that the men are trying to communicate with each other over the noise of the helicopter blades adds to the sense of urgency, and the fact that they are aware that the patient is in a "critical situation" and that they "have no time to lose" creates a sense of desperation. The image of the men moving away from the helicopter towards the exit, with the sense that they are in a hurry, is particularly effective in building suspense. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still building up to something, and the suspense is not yet fully released.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph is a slow and methodical description of the daily routine of a hospital cleaner, which is not typically a suspenseful topic. The use of mundane details, such as the cleaner's route, the lack of interesting events, and the lack of tension or conflict, makes it difficult to build a sense of suspense. The paragraph is more focused on providing a sense of normalcy and routine, rather than creating a sense of danger or uncertainty. The only hint of potential tension is the lack of "wet floor" warning signs at the top of each section, but it is not enough to create a sense of suspense. Overall, the paragraph is more focused on establishing the setting and the daily routine of the cleaner, rather than creating a sense of tension or suspense.

The use of specific details, such as the location of the helipad exit, the service stairwell, and the east wing lift, creates a sense of realism and makes the scene feel more immediate. The conversation between the two men is also effective in building tension, as it suggests that they are in a hurry and that something is at stake. The fact that they are discussing the best way to get to the 6th floor, and that one of them is holding onto the bannister, suggests that they are in a state of heightened awareness and that something could go wrong at any moment. However, the paragraph is still building up to something, and the suspense is not yet fully released.

The fact that the two men are holding their breath and watching in horror suggests that they are on the edge of their seats, and that the reader is right there with them. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is a bit of a cliffhanger, and the suspense is not fully released. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and whether the case will reach its destination safely.
