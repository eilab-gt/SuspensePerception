Here's why:

* **High Stakes:**  The situation is immediately presented as critical â€“ a young boy needs a life-saving transplant, and time is of the essence.
* **Uncertainty:**  We know a donor has been found, but there's a strong sense of doubt about whether Robert will make it through the wait.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of "8 a.m." and the long wait until the liver's function is verified creates a sense of anticipation and urgency.

I'd rate the second paragraph a **5/9** on the suspense scale. 

Here's why:

* **Still Critical:** Despite the arrival of the organ, Robert's condition is still described as "critical but stable," reminding us that the situation is far from resolved.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is quite brief and lacks details about the events leading up to the helicopter landing or the reactions of the medical team. This leaves room for speculation but doesn't build significant suspense.
