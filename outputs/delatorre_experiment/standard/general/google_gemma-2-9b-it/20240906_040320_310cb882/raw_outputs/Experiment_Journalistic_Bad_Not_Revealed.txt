Here's why:

* **High stakes:** The situation is immediately presented as life-or-death, with Robert's critical condition and the urgency of the transplant.

* **Intrigue:** The promise of a real-life story with a specific time and location piques curiosity and makes the reader want to know what happens next. 


Let me know when you're ready for the next paragraph!

* **Time sensitivity:** The specific time adds to the sense of urgency, emphasizing that the operation needs to happen soon.
* **Less immediate danger:** While the situation is still serious, the phrase "critical but stable" slightly reduces the immediate sense of danger compared to the first paragraph.
