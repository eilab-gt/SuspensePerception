Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **4/9:**  The introduction sets up a tense situation but doesn't provide many details to create immediate suspense.

2. **5/9:** The arrival of the organ adds urgency and raises the stakes.

3. **7/9:** The focus on the men's hurried movements and the noisy helicopter creates a sense of tension and anticipation.

4. **2/9:** This paragraph is a bit of a lull in the story, focusing on the mundane task of the cleaner.

5. **6/9:** The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a sense of risk and foreshadows potential problems.

6. **8/9:** The man's slip and the case falling down the stairs is a major turning point, creating high suspense.

7. **7/9:** The uncertainty about the damage to the organ and the man's superstitious reaction heighten the tension.

8. **6/9:** The arrival of the doctors and the examination of the case create a sense of hope and anticipation, but also some worry.

9. **9/9:** The doctor's confirmation that the liver is damaged is a devastating blow and the most suspenseful moment in the story.

10. **7/9:** The detailed description of the biopsy adds to the tension and the sense of urgency.

11. **9/9:** The surgeon's struggle with the biopsy and the final diagnosis create a heart-stopping climax.

12. **5/9:** The conclusion, while sad, is somewhat anticlimactic after the intense suspense of the previous paragraph.
