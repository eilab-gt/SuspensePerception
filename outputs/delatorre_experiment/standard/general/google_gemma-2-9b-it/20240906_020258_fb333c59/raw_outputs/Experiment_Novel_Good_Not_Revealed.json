Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **3/9:**  It sets up the situation but doesn't immediately create a strong sense of suspense.
2. **4/9:**  The arrival of the organ and the mention of time pressure start to increase the tension.
3. **6/9:**  The description of the men's urgency and the helicopter noise creates a sense of immediacy and potential danger.
4. **1/9:** This paragraph is a bit of a lull in the suspense. It focuses on the cleaner's mundane routine.
5. **5/9:**  The decision to take the stairs adds to the sense that time is of the essence and raises the stakes.
6. **8/9:**  The man slipping and the case falling creates a major turning point and heightens the suspense significantly.
7. **7/9:**  The uncertainty about the damage to the liver and the man's frantic actions keep the tension high.
8. **6/9:**  The doctors' arrival and the examination of the case maintain the suspense, but the focus shifts slightly to the medical procedure.
9. **9/9:**  The revelation that the fridge ruptured is a major blow and creates a peak of suspense.
10. **7/9:** The description of the biopsy and the surgeon's nervousness amplifies the tension.
11. **8/9:**  The waiting for the results and the surgeon's careful actions create a nail-biting moment.
12. **3/9:** The relief at the successful transplant brings the story to a close and the suspense dissipates.
