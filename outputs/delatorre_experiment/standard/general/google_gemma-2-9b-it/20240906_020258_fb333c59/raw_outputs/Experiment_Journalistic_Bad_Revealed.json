Here's a breakdown of the suspense level for each paragraph, along with explanations:

1. **Suspense Level: 6** -  The introduction sets up a high-stakes situation with a time-sensitive medical emergency and a glimmer of hope (a donor found). The uncertainty of Robert's survival creates initial tension.

2. **Suspense Level: 5** - The arrival of the helicopter and the precise time add a sense of urgency, but the paragraph lacks a clear threat or obstacle.

3. **Suspense Level: 4** -  The description of the liver case is mundane, not particularly suspenseful.

4. **Suspense Level: 7** -  The mention of the wet floor and the missing sign introduces a potential hazard, raising the stakes and making us worry about what might happen.

5. **Suspense Level: 6** - The decision to use the service stairwell, coupled with the previous warning about the wet floor, increases the tension.

6. **Suspense Level: 8** -  The slip and the case plunging down the stairs is a dramatic turning point, creating a sense of immediate danger and potential disaster.

7. **Suspense Level: 7** - The split-second actions of the men and the uncertainty about the liver's condition heighten the suspense.

8. **Suspense Level: 6** - The prompt arrival of the doctors offers a glimmer of hope but doesn't alleviate the worry about the liver's fate.

9. **Suspense Level: 9** - The revelation that the bag ruptured is a devastating blow, raising the stakes to their highest point.

10. **Suspense Level: 5** - The move to the lab feels procedural, lessening the immediate suspense.

11. **Suspense Level: 8** - The confirmation that the liver is unusable is a crushing blow, bringing the story to a tragic climax.

12. **Suspense Level: 6** - The final outcome is known, but the reiteration of Robert's death reinforces the tragedy and the weight of the events.
