 1 - 4: These paragraphs set the stage for the story and introduce the characters and the situation. They are not particularly suspenseful as they mainly provide context and background information. I would rate them as a 3 on the suspense scale.

5 - 6: The suspense starts to build as the men carrying the liver enter the service stairwell and one of them slips. This creates a sense of uncertainty and tension as the reader wonders what will happen next. I would rate these paragraphs as a 6 on the suspense scale.

7 - 8: The suspense continues to build as one of the men goes to warn the doctors while the other stays with the case. The reader is left wondering if the doctors will be able to save the liver in time. I would rate these paragraphs as a 7 on the suspense scale.

9 - 10: The suspense reaches its peak as the doctors discover that the interior bag has ruptured and they take the case to the hepatic laboratory. The reader is on the edge of their seat, waiting to find out if the liver can still be used for the transplant. I would rate these paragraphs as an 8 on the suspense scale.

11 - 12: The suspense is resolved as the analysis shows that the liver cannot be used for the transplant and Robert Bent dies. These paragraphs are not suspenseful as the outcome is already known. I would rate them as a 1 on the suspense scale.
