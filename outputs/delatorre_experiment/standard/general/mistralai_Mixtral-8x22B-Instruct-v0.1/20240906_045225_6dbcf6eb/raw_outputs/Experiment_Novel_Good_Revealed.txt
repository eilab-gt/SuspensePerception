1 Robert Bent was born on 23 March 2000, in San Francisco, California. He was the only child of a middle-class family. His parents, John and Mary Bent, were both teachers at the local high school. They had been trying to have a baby for several years and were overjoyed when Robert was born. He was a healthy and happy baby, and his parents doted on him. However, when Robert was just two years old, he was diagnosed with a rare liver disease called biliary atresia. This meant that his liver was not functioning properly, and he would need a liver transplant to survive. His parents were devastated, but they were determined to do everything they could to save their son's life.
2 The Bents spent the next six years trying to find a suitable donor for Robert. They were put on a waiting list for a liver transplant, but the wait was long and uncertain. Robert's condition continued to deteriorate, and he was often in and out of the hospital. His parents were constantly worried about him, and they felt helpless as they watched their son suffer. They tried to keep his spirits up, but it was difficult. Robert was a brave little boy, but he was also scared and confused about what was happening to him.

The medical team was shocked and devastated. They had been preparing for this transplant for months, and now it seemed like it was not going to happen.
