1 The day before, on 23 February, the medical team had received a call from the California Transplant Donor Network (CTDN) informing them that they had found a suitable liver for Robert. The organ had been donated by a 12-year-old girl who had died in a car accident. The girl's family had agreed to donate her organs, and Robert was the first recipient on the waiting list. The medical team was overjoyed at the news and immediately began preparations for the transplant.
