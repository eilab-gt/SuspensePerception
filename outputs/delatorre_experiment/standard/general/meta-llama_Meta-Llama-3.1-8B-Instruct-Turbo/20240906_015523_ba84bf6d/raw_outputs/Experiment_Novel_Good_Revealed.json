Here are my ratings of the suspense level of each paragraph:

**Paragraph 1: 2/9** - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's a fairly straightforward and calm introduction to the plot. There's no sense of tension or danger yet.

**Paragraph 2: 4/9** - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates a sense of anticipation, but it's still a relatively calm and controlled scene.

**Paragraph 3: 6/9** - The scene on the roof of the hospital is more tense, with the two men hurrying to get the organ to Robert Bent. The noise of the helicopter blades and the urgency of the situation create a sense of urgency.

**Paragraph 4: 1/9** - This paragraph is a calm and mundane description of the hospital cleaner's daily routine. It's a nice contrast to the tension of the previous paragraphs, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

**Paragraph 5: 3/9** - The scene shifts back to the helipad exit, where the two men are discussing how to get the organ to Robert Bent. It's a relatively calm conversation, but there's a sense of anticipation as they prepare to move the organ.

**Paragraph 6: 8/9** - This paragraph is where the tension really starts to build. The man carrying the case slips and drops it, and the two men are left watching in horror as it rolls down the stairs. The suspense is palpable as they try to decide what to do next.

**Paragraph 7: 9/9** - This paragraph is the most suspenseful of the entire story. The two men are frozen in uncertainty, wondering if the organ has been damaged. The tension is almost unbearable as they try to decide what to do next.

**Paragraph 8: 7/9** - The colleague who dropped the case is now standing beside it, trying to think of anything except the possibility that the organ has been damaged. The superstition that he's trying to distract himself with adds a sense of eeriness to the scene.

**Paragraph 9: 9/9** - The doctors arrive, and the suspense reaches a fever pitch as they open the case and examine the organ. The revelation that the fridge has ruptured and the organ is damaged is a major plot twist that raises the stakes.

**Paragraph 10: 8/9** - The medical team is now
