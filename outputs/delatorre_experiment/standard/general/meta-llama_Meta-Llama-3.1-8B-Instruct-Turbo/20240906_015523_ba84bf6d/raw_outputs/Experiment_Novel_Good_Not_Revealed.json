Here are the suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 (The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's a relatively calm and straightforward introduction.)

2. 3 (The paragraph introduces the helicopter and the organ, but it's still a fairly ordinary and routine scene.)

3. 5 (The paragraph starts to build tension as the two men rush to get the organ to the hospital, but it's still a relatively fast-paced and action-oriented scene.)

4. 1 (This paragraph is a calm and mundane description of the cleaner's daily routine, which is a stark contrast to the tension building in the previous paragraphs.)

5. 4 (The paragraph starts to build tension again as the two men discuss their route and the importance of speed, but it's still a relatively straightforward and practical conversation.)

6. 8 (The paragraph introduces a sudden and unexpected twist as the man carrying the case slips and the case rolls down the stairs, which creates a sense of shock and alarm.)

7. 9 (The paragraph is extremely suspenseful as the two men hold their breath and worry about the fate of the organ, which has been damaged in the fall.)

8. 8 (The paragraph continues the suspense as the man who slipped is overcome with superstition and anxiety, while his colleague tries to reassure him and prevent him from moving.)

9. 9 (The paragraph is extremely suspenseful as the doctor opens the case and reveals the damage to the organ, which creates a sense of dread and uncertainty.)

10. 7 (The paragraph is still suspenseful as the medical team tries to determine the extent of the damage and whether the organ is still viable, but it's a bit more of a calm and clinical scene.)

11. 8 (The paragraph is suspenseful as the surgeon prepares to perform the biopsy, which is a critical and high-stakes procedure.)

12. 6 (The paragraph is a bit more of a relief as the medical team finally receives good news about the organ's function, but it's still a tense and anxious moment.)

Overall, the suspense builds gradually throughout the story, with a few key moments of high tension and release.
