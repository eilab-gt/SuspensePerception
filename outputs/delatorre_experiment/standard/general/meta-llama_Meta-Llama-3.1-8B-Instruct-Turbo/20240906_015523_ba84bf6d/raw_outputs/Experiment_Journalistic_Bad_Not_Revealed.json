Here are my ratings of the preceding paragraph's suspense level:

1. 1 (not suspenseful) - This paragraph is a straightforward introduction to the story and sets the scene, but it doesn't create any tension or suspense.

2. 2 (slightly suspenseful) - This paragraph provides some context and sets the stage for the arrival of the liver, but it's still a fairly mundane and predictable sequence of events.

3. 3 (somewhat suspenseful) - This paragraph introduces the liver and the men transporting it, but it's still a relatively ordinary scene.

4. 4 (somewhat suspenseful) - This paragraph creates a sense of foreboding, as the cleaner's actions might have contributed to the accident that's about to happen.

5. 6 (moderately suspenseful) - This paragraph raises the stakes, as the men are now carrying the liver and are about to descend the stairs.

6. 8 (moderately suspenseful) - This paragraph creates a sense of tension, as the man carrying the case slips and the case plunges down the stairs.

7. 7 (moderately suspenseful) - This paragraph raises the stakes further, as the doctors are now alerted to the situation and are waiting for the case to be retrieved.

8. 5 (somewhat suspenseful) - This paragraph is a bit of a letdown, as it's a fairly routine sequence of events (noting that the doctors arrived promptly).

9. 8 (moderately suspenseful) - This paragraph creates a sense of tension, as the doctors open the case and discover that the interior bag has ruptured.

10. 6 (moderately suspenseful) - This paragraph raises the stakes, as the doctors now have to deal with the consequences of the damaged liver.

11. 8 (moderately suspenseful) - This paragraph creates a sense of inevitability, as the analysis shows that the liver is unusable.

12. 9 (very suspenseful) - This paragraph is the most suspenseful of all, as it reveals the tragic outcome of the events that have unfolded.
