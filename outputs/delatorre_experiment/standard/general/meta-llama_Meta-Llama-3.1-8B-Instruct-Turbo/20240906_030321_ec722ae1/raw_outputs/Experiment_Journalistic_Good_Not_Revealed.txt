I would rate the preceding paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the stakes, but it's a fairly straightforward and factual account of a medical situation. The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" adds a hint of tension, but it's not enough to create a strong sense of suspense. The overall tone is more informative than ominous.
The liver transplant surgery was scheduled to take place at 9 a.m. on February 24, 2008. However, just as the medical team was about to start the procedure, the donor liver was still en route to the hospital. The surgeon, Dr. John Roberts, was getting anxious, and the anesthesiologist, Dr. Lisa Nguyen, was preparing the operating room for the patient. But as the minutes ticked by, the team began to worry that the liver might not arrive on time.
I would rate the preceding paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of relief and resolution, as the liver arrives on time, but it's a bit of a letdown after the tension built up in the previous paragraph.
