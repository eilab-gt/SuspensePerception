I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph sets the stage for a potentially dramatic story, but the tone is more matter-of-fact and informative, and the outcome is already stated (i.e., the boy dies).

2. The transplant team had been preparing for this moment for weeks, and the donor liver had been carefully transported from the East Coast to San Francisco. The medical staff had been briefed on the specifics of the organ, and the surgical team was on standby, ready to perform the delicate procedure. But as the minutes ticked by, the team's anxiety grew. The liver had been in transit for hours, and the clock was ticking. Would it arrive in time?

I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspense.

I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph is quite straightforward and matter-of-fact, and the outcome is already implied to be positive (the helicopter lands "punctually", which suggests that everything is going according to plan). The lack of any hint of danger or uncertainty makes the paragraph feel quite low-key and not very suspenseful.
1. But as the organ was being rushed to the operating room, a sudden change in the weather caused the helicopter to be delayed.

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making it more suspenseful.

While the paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension, it's more of a descriptive passage that sets the scene for the events that are about to unfold. The use of vivid details like the whirlwind of the spinning blades and the men's reactions to the noise creates a sense of atmosphere, but the outcome is still somewhat predictable, and the paragraph doesn't have a strong sense of cliffhanger or uncertainty. The mention of the patient's critical situation raises the stakes, but the paragraph doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or tension.

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension, as the reader is aware that the patient's life is at risk and that the liver is crucial to their survival.

The reader is left wondering why this paragraph is included, and how it relates to the rest of the story.
I'd rate the preceding paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph is a relatively calm and matter-of-fact description of the hospital's layout and the men's conversation. While it's clear that they're in a hurry to get to the patient, the tone is still relatively relaxed and the outcome is not in doubt. The conversation between the two men is more of a minor detail than a source of tension or suspense.
6 The man carrying the case began to make his way down the service stairwell, his hand grasping the bannister tightly as he descended.

The silence between them was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of their footsteps.

7 The case came to rest at the bottom of the stairs, its blue cover dented and scratched. The two men stood frozen, their faces pale, as they stared at the case in horror.

The paragraph doesn't create a sense of urgency or danger, and the reader is aware that the situation is being handled carefully and professionally. The paragraph feels more like a resolution of the previous suspenseful moment, rather than a continuation of it.
8 The cleaner, who had been quietly going about his work, looked up to see the two men rushing past him, their faces pale and worried.

The man felt a chill run down his spine.

The doctor's shaking head and closing the case suggests that the situation is serious, and the reader is left feeling a sense of dread. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the outcome is somewhat predictable, and the reader is aware that the liver is likely to be unusable. However, the paragraph is still a masterful build-up of tension and suspense.
10 The two men stood in stunned silence, their eyes fixed on the case as the refrigerated air continued to escape. The doctor's face was a picture of disappointment and frustration.

The surgeon's relief and satisfaction at not encountering any resistance, and the calm and methodical way he analyzes the sample, creates a sense of normalcy and routine. The fact that the metabolic rate confirms the worst fears of the surgeon and his colleagues is a bit predictable, and the paragraph doesn't have the same level of tension and uncertainty as the previous one. The only thing that keeps the paragraph from being completely non-suspenseful is the hint of concern and anxiety in the surgeon's expression, and the fact that the diagnosis is not what they were hoping for.
