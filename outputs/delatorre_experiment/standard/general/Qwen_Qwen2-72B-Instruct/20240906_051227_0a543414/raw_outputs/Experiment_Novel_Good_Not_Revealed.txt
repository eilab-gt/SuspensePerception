The paragraph provides a resolution to the suspense that has been building throughout the story. The confirmation that the liver is functioning correctly and that the damage sustained during transit did not affect the transplant's success brings a sense of relief. However, the level of suspense is not as high as in previous paragraphs because the outcome is presented as a fact, and the tension that was present during the uncertainty of the situation has been resolved. The rating of 6 reflects that while the paragraph is not as suspenseful as the events leading up to it, it still holds some level of suspense due to the critical nature of the transplant's success and the implications for the patient's health.
