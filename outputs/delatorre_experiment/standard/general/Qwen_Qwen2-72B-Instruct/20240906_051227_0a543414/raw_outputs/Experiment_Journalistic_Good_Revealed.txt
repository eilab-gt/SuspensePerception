This paragraph resolves the central tension of the story by confirming that the liver transplant was successful and that the liver is functioning correctly despite the damage it sustained during transit. The confirmation of the transplant's success provides a sense of relief and closure, but the suspense leading up to this point was high, given the critical nature of the operation and the unexpected events that occurred. I would rate this paragraph as 6 on the suspense scale, as it provides resolution rather than building tension.
