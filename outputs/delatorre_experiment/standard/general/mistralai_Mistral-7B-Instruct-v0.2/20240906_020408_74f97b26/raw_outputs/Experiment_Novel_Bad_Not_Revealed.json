 9 (The paragraphs leading up to the arrival of the helicopter and the men carrying the liver are quite suspenseful as they build up the anticipation for the liver transplant and the urgency of the situation. The paragraph describing the cleaner going about his job is less suspenseful as it is a description of a routine task. However, the paragraphs following the cleaner's description, as the men carry the liver down the stairs and it falls, are very suspenseful as they describe a potentially catastrophic event and the consequences of that event.)
