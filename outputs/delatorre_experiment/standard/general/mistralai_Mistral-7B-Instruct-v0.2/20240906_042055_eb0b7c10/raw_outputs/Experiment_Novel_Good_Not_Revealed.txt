 9 (The paragraph sets up an urgent and critical situation, creating a high level of suspense as we wait to find out what happens next.)
 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here's the correct rating for the first paragraph:

1 What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical.

Rating: 8 (The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension, but we don't yet know the specifics of Robert's condition or the challenges they might face during the transplant, so the suspense level is not yet at its peak.) 

I will continue to rate the suspense level after each subsequent paragraph.
