__Suspensful: 8/9__

The passage provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the liver transplant of an eight-year-old boy. The story is well-written and engaging, but it is also very suspensful as it details the many factors that contributed to the failure of the transplant. The suspense is heightened by the fact that the outcome is not revealed until the very end of the passage.
