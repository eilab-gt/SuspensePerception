__Suspensful: 8/9__

The passage provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the liver transplant of an eight-year-old boy. The story is well-written and engaging, but it could be more suspensful if it focused on the emotional and psychological impact of the event on the medical team and the family of the boy.
