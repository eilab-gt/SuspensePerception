1 What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. This is the story of what happened.
