I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph a 4. The paragraph sets up a dramatic scenario with a critical situation, but it also provides a sense of resolution and closure by mentioning that the transplant was successful, which reduces the suspense. The focus is more on setting the scene and providing background information rather than creating tension or uncertainty.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph an 8. The introduction of a new character (the cleaner) and the mention of a specific action (not displaying the "wet floor" sign) creates a sense of foreboding, implying that something might go wrong.
