I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 4. The paragraph sets the scene for a dramatic event, and the mention of a critical situation and a life-or-death operation creates some tension. However, the tone is more informative and explanatory than suspenseful, and the fact that the story is being framed as a "real event" takes some of the edge off the suspense.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as an 8. This paragraph suddenly shifts the focus to a seemingly unrelated detail, the cleaner and the wet floor, which creates a sense of foreboding and suggests that something might go wrong.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 5. The previous paragraph was very suspenseful, but this one is more of a relief, as the situation is being handled and the doctors are being warned.
