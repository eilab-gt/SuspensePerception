Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more informative than suspenseful.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some anticipation, but it's still a fairly routine and expected event.

3. 4 - The description of the men descending from the helicopter and the emphasis on the critical situation of the patient raises the stakes and creates some tension.

4. 5 - The introduction of the cleaner and the description of his mundane task creates a sense of normalcy, but the lack of warning signs and the whistling creates a subtle sense of unease.

5. 6 - The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the lift creates some tension, and the mention of the patient's critical condition raises the stakes.

6. 7 - The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a dramatic and intense moment, and the suspense is high as the reader wonders if the organ has been damaged.

7. 8 - The men's reactions and the decision to call the doctors creates more tension and suspense as the reader waits to see if the organ is still viable.

8. 9 - The man's superstition and the doctors' arrival creates a sense of urgency and raises the suspense.

9. 10 - The doctor's explanation of the damage to the fridge and the uncertainty about the liver's condition is suspenseful and worrying.

10. 11 - The description of the biopsy procedure and the surgeon's nervousness creates a high level of suspense and tension.

11. 12 - The surgeon's relief and the subsequent diagnosis of the liver's deterioration is a dramatic and intense moment, and the suspense is resolved in a tragic way.

Overall, the story builds suspense gradually, with moments of high tension and release. The use of everyday details and mundane tasks creates a sense of normalcy that makes the dramatic events more impactful.
