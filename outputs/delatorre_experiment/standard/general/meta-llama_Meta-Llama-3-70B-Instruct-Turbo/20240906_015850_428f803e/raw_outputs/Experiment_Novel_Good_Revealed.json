I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale.

1. Not suspensful (2) - This paragraph sets the scene and provides background information, but it doesn't create any sense of tension or suspense.

2. Not suspensful (2) - This paragraph continues to set the scene and provide details, but it's still more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

3. Somewhat suspensful (5) - This paragraph starts to create some tension by introducing the urgency of the situation and the importance of the liver transplant. The description of the men rushing to deliver the liver adds to the sense of urgency.

4. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is a brief interlude that provides some background information about the cleaner, but it doesn't add to the suspense.

5. Somewhat suspensful (5) - This paragraph continues to build tension as the men carrying the liver navigate the hospital corridors, and the reader is aware of the importance of their mission.

6. Very suspensful (8) - This paragraph is where the suspense really starts to build. The man's foot slipping on the stairs and the liver case rolling down the stairs creates a sense of chaos and danger.

7. Very suspensful (8) - The aftermath of the accident is tense and suspenseful, as the men wait to see if the liver has been damaged.

8. Somewhat suspensful (5) - This paragraph continues to build tension as the men wait for the doctors to arrive and assess the situation.

9. Very suspensful (8) - The moment of truth arrives, and the suspense is high as the doctor opens the case and inspects the liver.

10. Somewhat suspensful (5) - This paragraph provides some relief as the liver appears to be okay, but the tension is still present as the medical team waits for the results of the biopsy.

11. Very suspensful (9) - This paragraph is extremely tense as the surgeon performs the biopsy, and the reader is aware of the high stakes.

12. Not suspensful (1) - The final paragraph is a resolution to the story, and the suspense has been resolved. It's more of a conclusion than a suspenseful passage.
