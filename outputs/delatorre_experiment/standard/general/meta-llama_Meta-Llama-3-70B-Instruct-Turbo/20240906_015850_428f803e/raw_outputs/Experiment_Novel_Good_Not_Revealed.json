Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a relatively routine procedure being described.

3. 4 - The sense of urgency and the critical condition of the patient start to build some suspense, especially with the mention of "no time to lose".

4. 5 - This paragraph is more of a detour, describing the cleaner's routine, and doesn't add much to the suspense.

5. 6 - The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift creates some tension, and the reader senses that something might go wrong.

6. 8 - The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a very suspenseful moment, as the reader is worried about the fate of the liver.

7. 8 - The aftermath of the fall, with the men waiting anxiously to see if the liver is damaged, is still quite suspenseful.

8. 7 - The scene shifts to the medical team being alerted, which is less suspenseful than the previous two paragraphs.

9. 9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured is a very suspenseful moment, as the reader fears the worst for the liver.

10. 6 - The transfer of the liver to the laboratory and the examination process is still suspenseful, but the reader is hopeful that the liver might still be usable.

11. 9 - The biopsy procedure is extremely suspenseful, as the reader is worried about the surgeon's precision and the potential consequences of a mistake.

12. 2 - The final paragraph is more of a resolution, and the suspense is relieved when it's revealed that the liver is functioning correctly.
