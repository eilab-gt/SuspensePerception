Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 6 - The paragraph sets up a sense of urgency and importance, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful event.

2. 2 - The helicopter landing is a routine event, and there's no sense of danger or tension.

3. 3 - The introduction of the liver and the two men adds some interest, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

4. 5 - The mention of the cleaner leaving without displaying the "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it implies that something might go wrong.

5. 6 - The decision to take the stairs adds some tension, as it creates a sense of risk.

6. 8 - The man slipping and the case plunging down the stairs is a sudden and unexpected event that creates a lot of suspense.

7. 7 - The aftermath of the accident is still suspenseful, as the reader wonders if the liver is okay.

8. 5 - The doctors arriving promptly is a relief, but it's still unclear what the outcome will be.

9. 8 - The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured is another unexpected twist that raises the stakes.

10. 6 - The biopsy is a necessary step, but it's not as suspenseful as the previous events.

11. 7 - The analysis showing that the organ is still usable is a relief, but it's still unclear if the transplant will be successful.

12. 2 - The final outcome is a relief, and the suspense is resolved, so this paragraph is not very suspenseful.
