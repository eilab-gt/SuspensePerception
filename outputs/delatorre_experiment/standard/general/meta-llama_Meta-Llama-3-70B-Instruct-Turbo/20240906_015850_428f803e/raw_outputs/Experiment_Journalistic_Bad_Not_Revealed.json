I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as follows:

1. Suspense level: 2 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 1 - The arrival of the helicopter is a necessary step in the story, but it's a fairly routine event and doesn't create much tension.

3. Suspense level: 1 - The introduction of the liver and the men carrying it is important to the story, but it's still a fairly mundane detail.

4. Suspense level: 3 - The mention of the cleaner finishing their work and not displaying the "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it implies that something might go wrong.

5. Suspense level: 4 - The decision to take the service stairwell creates a sense of tension, as it's a deviation from the expected route and might lead to complications.

6. Suspense level: 8 - The moment the man slips and the case plunges down the stairs is a dramatic and intense moment, creating a lot of suspense.

7. Suspense level: 6 - The aftermath of the accident is still tense, as the reader is worried about the fate of the liver and Robert Bent.

8. Suspense level: 2 - The arrival of the doctors is a necessary step, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

9. Suspense level: 9 - The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured is a major plot twist and creates a lot of suspense, as it implies that the transplant might not be possible.

10. Suspense level: 5 - The biopsy and analysis of the organ's condition is a necessary step, but it's not as suspenseful as the previous revelation.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The discovery that the organ is unusable creates a lot of tension, as it means that Robert Bent's life is in danger.

12. Suspense level: 1 - The final paragraph is more of a conclusion than a suspenseful passage, as the outcome is already known.
