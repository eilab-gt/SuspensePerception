I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale, where 1 is "not suspenseful" and 9 is "very suspenseful".

1. Suspense level: 2 - The paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the liver creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

3. Suspense level: 5 - The sense of urgency is introduced, and the reader starts to feel that time is of the essence. The description of the men rushing to deliver the liver adds to the tension.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a calm interlude, introducing the cleaner and his routine. It's a break from the suspenseful scene.

5. Suspense level: 6 - The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates some tension, and the reader starts to worry about the liver's safety.

6. Suspense level: 9 - The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a very suspenseful moment. The reader is on edge, wondering if the liver will be damaged.

7. Suspense level: 8 - The aftermath of the fall is tense, and the reader is worried about the liver's condition. The men's caution and decision to call the doctors add to the suspense.

8. Suspense level: 7 - The man's superstition and the doctors' arrival create some tension, but the scene is more anticipatory than actively suspenseful.

9. Suspense level: 9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured is a very suspenseful moment. The reader is worried about the liver's condition and the consequences for Robert.

10. Suspense level: 6 - The laboratory scene is tense, but it's more of a procedural passage than a highly suspenseful one.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The biopsy procedure is suspenseful, especially since the surgeon is nervous and the reader is aware of the high stakes.

12. Suspense level: 1 - The final paragraph is more of a conclusion than a suspenseful passage. The reader already knows the outcome, so there's no tension or suspense.
