They knew that every minute counted, and that the success of the transplant depended on their skill and precision.

The liver was expected to arrive at any moment, and the team was ready to receive it. They had all the necessary equipment laid out and the operating table was sterilized and covered with a fresh, white sheet. The operating room was cold and sterile, but the air was thick with tension.

As the minutes ticked by, the team continued to prepare. They checked and double-checked their equipment, and went over their plans one last time. They knew that Robert's condition was critical, and that every second was crucial. They couldn't afford to make any mistakes.

But despite their best efforts, the liver still hadn't arrived. The team grew more and more anxious as the hours passed. They knew that the longer they waited, the greater the risk to Robert's health. They began to worry that something had gone wrong with the donor or the transport of the organ.

Just as the team was beginning to lose hope, the phone rang. It was the transplant coordinator, and she had some news. The liver had arrived, but it was not in good condition. The team was faced with a difficult decision: should they go ahead with the transplant, knowing that the liver might not be viable, or should they wait for a better one to become available? They knew that every second counted, but they also knew that they couldn't risk putting Robert's life in jeopardy.
