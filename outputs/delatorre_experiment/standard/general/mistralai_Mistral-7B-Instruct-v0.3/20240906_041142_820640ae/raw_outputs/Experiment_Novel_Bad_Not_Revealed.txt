The narrative sets up a tense situation with a critical patient, an imminent surgery, and a race against time for the arrival of a suitable organ. This creates a high level of suspense.
 2 The boy, Robert Bent, was diagnosed with a rare liver disease called biliary atresia when he was just six weeks old. The disease causes the bile ducts in the liver to become blocked, leading to liver damage and, eventually, liver failure. His parents were told that without a transplant, he would not live past his first birthday. But Robert proved them wrong, surviving for eight years with the help of medication and regular hospital visits. However, his condition had worsened in recent months, and his doctors believed that he would not survive much longer without a transplant. 3 On the day of the surgery, Robert was weak and pale, but his spirit remained strong. He was surrounded by his family and the medical team, all of whom were determined to save his life. As the hours passed, there was still no sign of the donor organ. 4 Just as hope seemed to be fading, a call came in from the organ procurement agency. A suitable liver had been found, and it was on its way. The medical team sprang into action, preparing for the transplant surgery. But as they waited for the organ to arrive, Robert's condition continued to deteriorate. 5 The organ arrived at the hospital at 4 p.m., and the transplant surgery began. The operation was long and difficult, but the medical team worked tirelessly to save Robert's life. Finally, at 10 p.m., the surgery was over, and Robert was in recovery. 6 The next few days were touch and go, but Robert slowly began to improve. He was weak and tired, but his spirits remained high. After a week in the hospital, he was finally well enough to go home. 7 Today, Robert is a healthy, active eight-year-old boy. He still has regular check-ups, but his liver is functioning normally, and he leads a normal life. His story is a testament to the power of hope, determination, and the incredible work of the medical team at UCSF Benioff Childrenâ€™s Hospital. 8 What makes Robert's story even more remarkable is that his donor was a 17-year-old girl who had tragically died in a car accident. Her family made the selfless decision to donate her organs, giving the gift of life to several people, including Robert. This story
