Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. Suspensfulness rating: 2/9 (This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more informative than suspenseful.)

2. Suspensfulness rating: 3/9 (This paragraph adds some tension by mentioning that Robert Bent's situation is critical, but it's still relatively calm.)

3. Suspensfulness rating: 4/9 (This paragraph introduces the organ transport team and the liver, which is the key to the story. It's starting to get more interesting.)

4. Suspensfulness rating: 5/9 (This paragraph adds a sense of foreboding by mentioning that the cleaner didn't put up the "wet floor" sign, which could lead to an accident.)

5. Suspensfulness rating: 6/9 (This paragraph sets the stage for the accident, and the reader can sense that something is going to go wrong.)

6. Suspensfulness rating: 8/9 (This paragraph is where the accident happens, and it's quite dramatic. The reader is on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next.)

7. Suspensfulness rating: 7/9 (This paragraph adds to the tension by describing the doctor's reaction to the accident and the fact that the case isn't handled until the doctors arrive.)

8. Suspensfulness rating: 8/9 (This paragraph is a cliffhanger, as the reader is left wondering what will happen when the doctors open the case.)

9. Suspensfulness rating: 9/9 (This paragraph is the climax of the story, as the reader finds out that the liver is damaged. It's a big reveal that changes the direction of the story.)

10. Suspensfulness rating: 7/9 (This paragraph adds to the tension by describing the analysis of the liver and the possibility that it might still be usable.)

11. Suspensfulness rating: 8/9 (This paragraph is a turning point in the story, as the reader finds out that the liver is still usable. It's a relief, but also sets up the final resolution.)

12. Suspensfulness rating: 2/9 (This paragraph is the resolution of the story, and it's more informative than suspenseful.)
