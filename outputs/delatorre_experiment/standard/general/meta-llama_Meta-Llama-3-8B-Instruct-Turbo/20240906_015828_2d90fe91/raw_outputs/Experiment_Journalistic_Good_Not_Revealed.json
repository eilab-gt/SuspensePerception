Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. Not suspensful (1) - This is an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the story, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

2. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is simply a factual description of the helicopter landing and the medical team waiting for the organ.

3. Not suspensful (1) - Another factual paragraph describing the two men and the liver case.

4. Mildly suspensful (3) - This paragraph introduces a potential problem (the wet floor) that could cause an accident, but it's not particularly dramatic.

5. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph creates tension by describing the men walking down the stairs, and the potential for an accident to occur.

6. Very suspensful (9) - The moment the man slips and the case plunges down the stairs is a dramatic and suspenseful moment.

7. Suspensful (6) - The doctor's colleague stays with the case, which creates a sense of uncertainty and tension.

8. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is simply a factual description of the doctors arriving.

9. Suspensful (6) - The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured creates tension and uncertainty.

10. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is a factual description of the biopsy and analysis.

11. Mildly suspensful (3) - This paragraph creates a sense of relief that the organ is still usable, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

12. Not suspensful (1) - This final paragraph is a factual description of the transplant being successful.

Overall, the story builds up to a suspenseful moment (paragraph 6) and then resolves in a relatively calm and factual manner.
