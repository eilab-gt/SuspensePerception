Here are my ratings of the paragraphs:

1. Suspensfulness rating: 2/9 (This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of a factual introduction rather than a suspenseful one.)

2. Suspensfulness rating: 3/9 (This paragraph is a bit more interesting, as it introduces the helicopter and the arrival of the organ, but it's still a fairly straightforward and factual description.)

3. Suspensfulness rating: 4/9 (This paragraph adds some intrigue with the mention of a small blue fridge and the fully functioning liver, but it's still a fairly ordinary description of events.)

4. Suspensfulness rating: 5/9 (This paragraph introduces a bit of tension with the mention of the cleaner not putting up the "wet floor" sign, and the possibility of something going wrong.)

5. Suspensfulness rating: 6/9 (This paragraph raises the stakes a bit, as the men carrying the liver are walking down the stairs, and something could go wrong at any moment.)

6. Suspensfulness rating: 8/9 (This paragraph is where things start to go wrong, and the suspense builds as the case slips down the stairs.)

7. Suspensfulness rating: 7/9 (This paragraph adds to the tension, as the men are trying to figure out what to do, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.)

8. Suspensfulness rating: 6/9 (This paragraph is a bit of a letdown, as it's just a straightforward description of the doctors arriving.)

9. Suspensfulness rating: 8/9 (This paragraph is where the suspense really builds, as the doctors open the case and discover that the organ is damaged.)

10. Suspensfulness rating: 7/9 (This paragraph adds to the tension, as the doctors are trying to figure out what to do with the damaged organ.)

11. Suspensfulness rating: 8/9 (This paragraph is where the outcome is revealed, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert Bent.)

12. Suspensfulness rating: 9/9 (This final paragraph is the most suspenseful of all, as it reveals the tragic outcome of the events that have unfolded.)
