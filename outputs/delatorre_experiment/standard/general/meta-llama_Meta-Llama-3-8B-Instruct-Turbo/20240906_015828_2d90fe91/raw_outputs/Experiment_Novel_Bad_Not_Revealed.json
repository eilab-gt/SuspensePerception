Here are my ratings for the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. Not suspensful (1) - This is an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the story. It's informative but not suspenseful.

2. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph simply describes the arrival of the helicopter and the organ. It's a straightforward and uneventful scene.

4. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is a non-essential backstory about a cleaner who is doing his job. It's not related to the main plot and doesn't create any suspense.

5. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph creates some tension as the man carrying the case is about to enter the corridor, and his colleague is warning him about the patient's location.

6. Very suspensful (9) - This paragraph is the turning point of the story. The man carrying the case slips and the organ falls down the stairs, creating a sense of chaos and uncertainty.
