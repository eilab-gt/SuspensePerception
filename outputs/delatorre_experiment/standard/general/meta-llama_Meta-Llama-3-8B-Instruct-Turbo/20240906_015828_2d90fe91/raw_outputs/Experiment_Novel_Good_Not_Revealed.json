Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2/9 - This paragraph is introductory and sets the stage for the story, but it's not very suspenseful.

2. 3/9 - This paragraph is more interesting, as it describes the arrival of the organ and the medical team's anticipation, but it's still relatively calm.

3. 4/9 - This paragraph starts to build tension as the two men descend from the helicopter and the reader realizes that something might go wrong.

4. 2/9 - This paragraph is a bit of a tangent, describing the daily routine of a hospital cleaner, and it's not very suspenseful.

5. 5/9 - This paragraph starts to build tension as the two men discuss the patient's condition and the urgency of the situation.

6. 8/9 - This paragraph is very suspenseful as the man carrying the case slips and the case rolls down the stairs, putting the entire transplant in jeopardy.

7. 9/9 - This paragraph is extremely suspenseful as the two men watch in horror as the case rolls down the stairs and consider the possibility that the liver might be damaged.

8. 8/9 - This paragraph is still very suspenseful as the man who slipped tries to think of anything except the possibility that the liver was damaged, and the reader is left wondering what will happen.

9. 9/9 - This paragraph is extremely suspenseful as the doctor opens the case and reveals that the liver has been damaged, putting Robert's life in jeopardy.

10-12. 5-7/9 - These paragraphs are more calm as the medical team works to examine the liver and determine its condition, but they're still suspenseful as the reader waits to find out if Robert's transplant will be successful.

Overall, the story builds tension and suspense gradually, with a few intense moments that keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
