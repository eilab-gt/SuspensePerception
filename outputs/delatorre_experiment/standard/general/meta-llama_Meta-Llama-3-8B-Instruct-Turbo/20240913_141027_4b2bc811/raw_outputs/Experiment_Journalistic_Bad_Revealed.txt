I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by setting the stage for a critical and potentially life-or-death situation, and then subverts the reader's expectations by revealing that the patient does not survive. The use of specific details, such as the time of day and the medical team's preparations, adds to the sense of realism and urgency. The paragraph also effectively creates a sense of anticipation and curiosity, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert and whether the liver transplant will be successful. However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it included more dramatic language or a greater sense of uncertainty and tension leading up to the tragic outcome.
