I would rate the suspensfulness of the preceding paragraph as a 6 out of 9. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and urgency, as the reader is aware that a critical situation is unfolding and that the outcome is uncertain. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of Robert's death, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate. However, the paragraph does not yet reveal the shocking twist that the organ sustained damage in transit, which would likely increase the suspensfulness of the story.

The use of vivid details, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the men's actions being "ducking down", helps to immerse the reader in the scene. The fact that the liver is being transported at a critical temperature and that the patient's situation is dire adds to the sense of suspense. The only thing that keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 is that the outcome is still uncertain, but the reader can sense that something is about to go wrong.
