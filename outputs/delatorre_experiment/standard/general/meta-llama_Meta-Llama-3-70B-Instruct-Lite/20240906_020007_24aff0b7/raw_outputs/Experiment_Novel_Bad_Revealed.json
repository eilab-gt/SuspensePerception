Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. 4 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

3. 5 - The description of the two men descending from the helicopter and rushing to deliver the organ creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

4. 1 - The introduction of the cleaner is a calm and mundane scene that breaks the tension built up in the previous paragraphs.

5. 3 - The description of the hospital's layout and the men's decision to take the stairs adds some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

6. 8 - The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a sudden and intense moment that creates a lot of suspense.

7. 6 - The men's reaction to the case reaching the bottom and their decision to call the doctors adds to the tension and suspense.

8. 5 - The man's concern about the condition of the liver and his reluctance to move adds some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

9. 9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured is a dramatic and intense moment that creates a lot of suspense.

10. 4 - The description of the laboratory and the examination of the liver is a more clinical and detached scene that reduces the tension.

11. 8 - The surgeon's nervousness and the risk of damaging the organ creates a lot of tension and suspense.

12. 1 - The final paragraph is more of a conclusion than a suspenseful passage, as the outcome is already known from the first paragraph.
