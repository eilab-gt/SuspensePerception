I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested.

1. Suspense level: 6 - The introduction sets the stage for a dramatic event, but it's more of a factual setup than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph is a straightforward description of the helicopter's arrival, with no sense of tension or suspense.

3. Suspense level: 2 - Another descriptive paragraph that doesn't build tension or suspense.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph seems out of place, and the introduction of the cleaner and the "wet floor" sign feels like an odd detail that doesn't contribute to the story's suspense.

5. Suspense level: 3 - The decision to take the stairs creates a slight sense of unease, but it's still a relatively calm passage.

6. Suspense level: 8 - This is where the story takes a dramatic turn, and the accident creates a sense of shock and tension.

7. Suspense level: 5 - The aftermath of the accident is described in a relatively calm tone, but the reader is still reeling from the previous paragraph's event.

8. Suspense level: 2 - The doctors' prompt arrival is a quick, straightforward sentence that doesn't add much suspense.

9. Suspense level: 8 - The discovery of the ruptured bag is another dramatic turn, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

10. Suspense level: 4 - The biopsy and analysis are described in a relatively calm tone, but the reader is still invested in the story's outcome.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The revelation that the organ is damaged beyond use is a devastating twist, and the reader is left feeling a sense of tragedy.

12. Suspense level: 1 - This final paragraph is a reiteration of the story's tragic conclusion, which is more of a summary than a suspenseful passage.
