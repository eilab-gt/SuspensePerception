Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter adds some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

3. 4 - The description of the men descending from the helicopter and rushing to deliver the liver adds some urgency and suspense.

4. 5 - The introduction of the cleaner's mundane task breaks the tension, so I'd rate this paragraph a 1.

5. 6 - The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator adds some suspense, as it creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

6. 7 - The moment when the man slips and the case rolls down the stairs is very suspenseful, so I'd rate this paragraph an 8.

7. 8 - The aftermath of the fall, with the men's concern about the liver's condition, keeps the suspense level high, so I'd rate this paragraph an 8 as well.

8. 9 - The description of the doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured is very suspenseful, so I'd rate this paragraph a 9.

9. 10 - The transfer of the liver to the laboratory and the preparation for the biopsy is a tense moment, so I'd rate this paragraph a 7.

10. 11 - The surgeon's nervousness and the delicate procedure of the biopsy create a lot of suspense, so I'd rate this paragraph a 9.

11. 12 - The final revelation that the liver is functioning correctly is a relief, so I'd rate this paragraph a 1, as it's more of a resolution than a suspenseful moment.
