I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested. Here are my ratings:

1. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph sets the scene and provides some background information, but it doesn't create much tension or suspense.

2. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a straightforward description of the helicopter's arrival and doesn't add much to the story in terms of suspense.

3. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is another descriptive passage that doesn't create much tension.

4. Suspense level: 3 - This paragraph introduces a potential hazard (the wet floor) but doesn't immediately create tension, as the focus is on the cleaner's actions.

5. Suspense level: 4 - The decision to use the service stairwell creates some tension, as it sets the stage for a potential accident.

6. Suspense level: 8 - This is where the story takes a dramatic turn, and the suspense level increases significantly. The accident is sudden and unexpected, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

7. Suspense level: 6 - The aftermath of the accident is tense, but the focus is on the reactions of the characters rather than the immediate consequences of the accident.

8. Suspense level: 4 - The arrival of the doctors is a relief, but it doesn't necessarily reduce the tension.

9. Suspense level: 7 - The discovery of the ruptured bag is a setback, and the reader is left wondering if the transplant will still be possible.

10. Suspense level: 5 - The biopsy is a necessary step, but it's not as suspenseful as the previous paragraphs.

11. Suspense level: 6 - The analysis provides some relief, but the reader is still wondering if the transplant will be successful.

12. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a repetition of the initial statement, and it doesn't add much to the story in terms of suspense.
