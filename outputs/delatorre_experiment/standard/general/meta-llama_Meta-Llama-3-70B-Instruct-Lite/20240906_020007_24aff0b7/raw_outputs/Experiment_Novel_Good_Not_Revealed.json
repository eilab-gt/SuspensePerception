Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful start.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a fairly routine and expected event.

3. 4 - The description of the two men descending from the helicopter and rushing to deliver the organ creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making it more suspenseful.

4. 5 - The introduction of the cleaner and his mundane task is a bit of a departure from the main storyline, and while it's interesting, it's not particularly suspenseful. Rating: 1
