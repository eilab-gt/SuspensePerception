I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 4. The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more of an introduction and a setup for the story rather than a suspenseful passage. The mention of the critical situation and the uncertainty about Robert's survival adds some tension, but it's not yet a cliffhanger or a dramatic twist.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 2. The paragraph is more of a straightforward update on the situation, and the use of "punctually" even adds a sense of routine to the event. The fact that Robert is in a critical but stable condition doesn't add much tension, as it's already established that his situation is critical.
