I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 4. The paragraph sets the scene and establishes a sense of urgency with the mention of a critical medical situation, but it's more of an introduction to the story rather than a suspenseful cliffhanger. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact than suspenseful.

(Rating for the first paragraph: 4)
I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 6. The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and expectation with the arrival of the helicopter, and the mention of Robert's critical condition adds a sense of urgency. However, the fact that the helicopter lands "punctually" and Robert is in a "stable" condition tempers the suspense, making it more of a steady build-up rather than a heart-stopping moment.

(Rating for the third paragraph: 8)
I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 2. This paragraph is a significant departure from the previous ones, which were building up the tension and urgency around Robert's liver transplant. This paragraph is a slow-paced, mundane description of a cleaner's daily routine, which feels like a non-essential detour from the main storyline. The tone is calm and peaceful, with the cleaner whistling as he works, which is the opposite of suspenseful.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 9. This paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as it creates a sudden and intense moment of crisis. The man's foot slipping and his subsequent loss of balance is a shocking and unexpected event that raises the stakes to a critical level. The image of the case rolling down the stairs, with the sound of loose keys, is a vivid and terrifying one, and the reader is left holding their breath in anticipation of the worst.

(Rating for the sixth paragraph: 9)
I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 5. This paragraph is a bit of a letdown after the intense suspense of the previous one. While it's still a tense moment, the fact that the case has stopped and the men are kneeling beside it is a bit of a relief. The conversation between the two men is more procedural and cautious, and the scene shifts from a dramatic moment to a more mundane one. The tension is still there, but it's more subdued. The use of words like "don't" and "be careful" adds some caution, but overall, the paragraph is more about the men's carefulness and caution rather than a heart-stopping moment.

(Rating for the seventh paragraph: 5)
I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as an 8. This paragraph is quite suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The colleague's superstition about the liver's condition being tied to his own suffering adds a layer of emotional intensity, and the description of his physical discomfort and pain raises the stakes. The arrival of the doctors and the request to "move away" creates a sense of urgency and importance, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of words like "overwhelmed" and "suffering" adds to the sense of drama and tension.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 9. This paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as it creates a sense of dread and disappointment. The description of the doctor opening the case and revealing the damaged contents is a heart-stopping moment, and the image of the refrigerated air escaping is a vivid and ominous one.

The use of words like "shaking his head" and "ruptured" adds to the sense of finality and tragedy.
