I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 6. The paragraph sets up a real-life event and introduces a sense of urgency and uncertainty, which creates some tension. The fact that the main character's situation is critical and he may not survive the wait adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph is more focused on setting the scene and providing background information, which prevents it from being extremely suspenseful.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 5. This paragraph is a bit of a letdown after the intense suspense of the previous one.

The suspense is still present, but it's not as intense as it was in the previous paragraph.
