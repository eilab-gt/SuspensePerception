I'd rate this paragraph a **7** for suspense.

Several factors contribute to the increased suspense:

* **Urgency:** The emphasis on time ("no time to lose") and the men's hurried movements create a sense of urgency.
* **Focus on the organ:** The description of the liver being stored at a specific temperature highlights its fragility and importance.
* **Limited communication:** The inaudible shouting and reliance on gestures adds a layer of tension and uncertainty.

The paragraph effectively conveys the high stakes and the race against time.
