I would rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspense scale. 

It sets up a real-life, high-stakes situation with a ticking clock (the boy's critical condition and the wait for the organ). The mention of a "suitable donor" found just the day before adds a glimmer of hope, but the uncertainty about Robert's survival keeps the tension high. 


Okay, I understand. Please provide the paragraph you'd like me to rate.  I'm ready! 


I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspense scale.

It introduces a sense of urgency with the precise time and the mention of the helicopter landing. The fact that Robert is in a "critical but stable" condition adds to the tension, as it implies that his situation is precarious. However, the paragraph is relatively short and doesn't reveal any immediate danger or conflict, which prevents it from being more suspenseful.
