<INST> The liver transplant was successful, but the medical team was not out of the woods yet. The next day, Robert’s body started to reject the new liver. The medical team had to act fast.

They can cause high blood pressure, diabetes, and slow growth. Robert’s parents were informed about the situation and the risks involved. They were told that this was Robert’s only chance of survival. They agreed to the treatment.
