 5: The suspense in this paragraph comes from the anticipation of something going wrong, as the cleaner has just finished mopping the floor and the men carrying the liver are about to walk down the stairs. However, the paragraph ends before they actually start walking, so the suspense is not fully realized yet.

6: This paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous one, as we see the man slip and the case with the liver rolling down the stairs. The description of the men holding their breath and watching in horror adds to the tension.

7: The suspense is maintained in this paragraph as the man goes to alert the medical team, while his colleague stays behind to watch the case. The sense of urgency is conveyed through the man's quick pace and the use of phrases like "without wasting any time."

8: The tension is heightened in this paragraph as the doctor confirms that the case has been damaged and the liver might be ruined. The man's superstition about the liver's condition depending on his suffering adds an element of psychological suspense.

9: The suspense reaches its climax in this paragraph as the doctor confirms that the liver has been damaged and the transplant might not be successful. The description of the thin stream of refrigerated air slowly escaping from the case adds a visual element to the tension.

10-11: The suspense is somewhat alleviated in these paragraphs as the medical team examines the liver and finds that it has not been damaged. However, the tension is still present as the surgeon carries out the biopsy and we wait for the results.

12: The suspense is fully resolved in this paragraph as the medical team verifies that the liver is functioning correctly and has not been affected by the damage. The use of the phrase "finally" at the beginning of the paragraph emphasizes the sense of relief and closure.
