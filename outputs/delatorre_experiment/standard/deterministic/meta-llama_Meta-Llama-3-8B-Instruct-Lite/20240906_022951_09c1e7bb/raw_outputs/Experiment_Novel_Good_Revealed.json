Here are my ratings for the preceding paragraphs:

1. 2/9 (not very suspenseful, just setting the stage for the story)

2. 4/9 (getting more interesting, with the arrival of the helicopter and the organ, but still not very suspenseful)

3. 5/9 (the scene is getting more intense, with the two men rushing to get the organ to the patient, but it's still not very suspenseful)

4. 2/9 (this paragraph is a bit of a lull, just a normal day for the hospital cleaner)

5. 4/9 (things are starting to get more intense, with the men rushing to get the organ to the patient, but it's still not very suspenseful)

6. 7/9 (the case falls down the stairs, and the men are in a state of panic, so this paragraph is getting more suspenseful)

7. 8/9 (the men are worried about the organ being damaged, and the tension is building)

8. 9/9 (the doctor is about to examine the organ, and the suspense is palpable)

9. 9/9 (the doctor opens the case, and the suspense is at its peak)

10. 8/9 (the doctor examines the organ, and the suspense is still high)

11. 9/9 (the doctor is about to perform a biopsy, and the suspense is almost unbearable)

12. 1/9 (the suspense is over, and the story concludes with a positive outcome)
