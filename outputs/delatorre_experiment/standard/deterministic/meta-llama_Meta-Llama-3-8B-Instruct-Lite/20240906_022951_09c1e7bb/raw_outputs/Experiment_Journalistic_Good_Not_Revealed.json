Here are my ratings for the paragraphs:

1. 2 (not very suspensful) - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's a fairly straightforward introduction to the situation.

2. 3 (somewhat suspensful) - The arrival of the helicopter and the men carrying the organ creates a sense of anticipation, but it's still a fairly normal and expected part of the story.

3. 4 (somewhat suspensful) - The introduction of the small blue fridge case storing the liver is an interesting detail, but it's not particularly suspenseful on its own.

4. 5 (somewhat suspensful) - The fact that the cleaner didn't put up the "wet floor" sign creates a sense of potential danger, but it's not yet clear how it will impact the story.

5. 6 (6) - This is where things start to get more suspensful. The men walking down the stairs, the one slipping and the case falling, creates a sense of tension and danger.

6. 8 (8) - The doctor rushing to warn the other doctors, and the man staying to supervise the case, creates a sense of urgency and concern.

7. 9 (9) - The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured and the organ is damaged is a major plot twist and creates a high level of suspense.

8. 5 (somewhat suspensful) - The analysis of the organ's condition is important to the story, but it's not particularly suspenseful on its own.

9. 1 (not suspensful) - This paragraph is more of a resolution to the story, and the fact that the organ is still usable is a relief, but not particularly suspenseful.

10. 1 (not suspensful) - The final paragraph is a straightforward conclusion to the story, and the fact that the transplant was successful is a positive outcome, but not particularly suspenseful.
