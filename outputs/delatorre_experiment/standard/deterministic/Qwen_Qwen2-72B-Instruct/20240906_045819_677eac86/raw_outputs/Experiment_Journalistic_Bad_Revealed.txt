The paragraph builds tension by introducing a time element and the critical condition of the patient, while also showing that the medical team is prepared and the organ has arrived on time.

The finality of the situation and the implications of the medical team's inability to perform the transplant due to the damaged organ create a high level of emotional impact and suspense. The suspense in this case is not about the uncertainty of the outcome, as it has already been revealed, but about the gravity and finality of the event.
