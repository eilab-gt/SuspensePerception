I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested. Here are my ratings:

1. Suspense level: 6 - The paragraph sets the stage for a dramatic event, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph is more of a straightforward description of the scene, without much tension or suspense.

3. Suspense level: 3 - The introduction of the liver and the blue fridge adds some interest, but it's still a fairly calm passage.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a seemingly unrelated detail about the cleaner, and it doesn't add much suspense to the story.

5. Suspense level: 2 - The decision to take the stairs is a minor plot point, but it doesn't create much tension.

6. Suspense level: 8 - This is where the story takes a dramatic turn, and the accident creates a sense of shock and surprise.

7. Suspense level: 5 - The aftermath of the accident is tense, but the focus is more on the reaction than the action itself.

8. Suspense level: 2 - The arrival of the doctors is a necessary plot point, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

9. Suspense level: 7 - The discovery of the ruptured bag is a critical moment in the story, and it raises the stakes.

10. Suspense level: 4 - The biopsy is a necessary step in the process, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The analysis reveals the extent of the damage, and it's a critical moment in the story.

12. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a repetition of the initial statement, and it's more of a conclusion than a suspenseful passage.

Overall, the story builds up to a dramatic climax, but some paragraphs are more suspenseful than others. The accident in paragraph 6 is the most suspenseful moment, and the aftermath is also quite tense.
