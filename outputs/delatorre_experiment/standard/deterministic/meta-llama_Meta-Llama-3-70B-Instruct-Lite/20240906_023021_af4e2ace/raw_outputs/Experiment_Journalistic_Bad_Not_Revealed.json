I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested. Here are my ratings:

1. Suspense level: 6 - The paragraph sets the stage for a dramatic event, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 2 - The arrival of the helicopter is a necessary step in the story, but it's a fairly routine event, and there's no sense of tension or suspense.

3. Suspense level: 3 - The introduction of the liver and the blue fridge adds some interest, but it's still a fairly straightforward description.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a bit of a non-sequitur, and the mention of the cleaner and the "wet floor" sign seems like an odd detail. It's not very suspenseful.

5. Suspense level: 4 - The decision to take the stairs adds a bit of tension, as it's an unusual choice, but it's still not very suspenseful.

6. Suspense level: 8 - Ah, now things start to get interesting! The slip on the stairs is a dramatic event, and the image of the case plunging down the stairs is quite vivid.

7. Suspense level: 5 - The reaction of the two men is fairly predictable, and while there's some tension, it's not extremely suspenseful.

8. Suspense level: 2 - The arrival of the doctors is another necessary step, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

9. Suspense level: 9 - The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured is a major plot twist, and it's very suspenseful! The reader is left wondering what will happen next.

10. Suspense level: 4 - The biopsy is a necessary step, but it's not extremely suspenseful, as the outcome is already somewhat predictable.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The analysis shows that the organ is damaged, which is a major setback, and the suspense level increases again.

12. Suspense level: 9 - The final outcome is tragic, and the suspense level is high as the reader is left feeling a sense of shock and disappointment.
