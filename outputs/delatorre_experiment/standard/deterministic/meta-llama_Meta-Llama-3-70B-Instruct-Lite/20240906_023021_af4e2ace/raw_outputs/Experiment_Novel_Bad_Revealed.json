I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale, where 1 is "not suspenseful" and 9 is "very suspenseful".

1. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

3. Suspense level: 4 - The sense of urgency and the critical condition of the patient start to build some tension, but it's still a relatively slow-burning scene.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a bit of a detour, focusing on the cleaner's mundane job, and doesn't add much to the suspense.

5. Suspense level: 5 - The decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates some tension, and the reader starts to feel that something might go wrong.

6. Suspense level: 8 - The accident with the case and the liver creates a sudden and intense moment of suspense, making the reader worry about the consequences.

7. Suspense level: 7 - The aftermath of the accident and the uncertainty about the liver's condition keep the tension high.

8. Suspense level: 6 - The scene is still tense, but the focus on the character's superstition and pain slows down the pace a bit.

9. Suspense level: 9 - The revelation that the liver is damaged is a major plot twist, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert.

10. Suspense level: 5 - The medical team's efforts to examine the liver are tense, but the pace is slower than in the previous paragraphs.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The biopsy scene is intense and suspenseful, with the surgeon's nervousness and the risk of damaging the organ.

12. Suspense level: 9 - The final revelation that the liver is damaged and Robert's death is certified is a devastating conclusion, and the reader is left with a sense of tragedy and loss.
