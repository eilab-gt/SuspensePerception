I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale, where 1 is "not suspenseful" and 9 is "very suspenseful".

1. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph sets the scene and provides background information, but it doesn't create much tension or suspense.

2. Suspense level: 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some anticipation, but it's still a relatively calm and straightforward scene.

3. Suspense level: 4 - The description of the two men rushing to deliver the organ creates a sense of urgency, but it's still a fairly routine scene.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a calm and peaceful interlude, focusing on the cleaner's mundane task. It's a break from the main storyline and doesn't create any suspense.

5. Suspense level: 5 - The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder if they'll make it in time.

6. Suspense level: 8 - The man's foot slipping on the stairs and the case rolling down creates a sudden and intense moment of suspense, making the reader worry about the fate of the organ.

7. Suspense level: 7 - The aftermath of the accident creates tension as the men wait to see if the organ is damaged, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

8. Suspense level: 6 - The man's reluctance to move and his superstition about the liver's condition creates some tension, but it's a relatively calm scene compared to the previous one.

9. Suspense level: 9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured creates a high level of suspense and tension, making the reader worry about the fate of the transplant.

10. Suspense level: 5 - The medical team's examination of the liver creates some tension, but it's a more clinical and detached scene compared to the previous one.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The surgeon's nervousness and the delicate procedure create a high level of tension and suspense, making the reader worry about the outcome.

12. Suspense level: 1 - The final paragraph is a resolution to the story, and while it's a relief to know that the transplant was successful, it's not particularly suspenseful.
