I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested. Here are my ratings:

1. Suspense level: 6 - The paragraph sets the stage for a dramatic event, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 2 - The arrival of the helicopter is a necessary step in the story, but it's a fairly routine event, and there's no sense of tension or suspense.

3. Suspense level: 2 - The description of the liver being carried in a small blue fridge is interesting, but it's still a fairly mundane detail.

4. Suspense level: 1 - The mention of the cleaner finishing their work and leaving without posting a "wet floor" sign is a seemingly insignificant detail, and there's no sense of suspense.

5. Suspense level: 3 - The decision to take the service stairwell adds a hint of tension, as it's a less common route, but it's still not particularly suspenseful.

6. Suspense level: 8 - This is where the story takes a dramatic turn! The sudden slip and fall of the man carrying the case creates a sense of shock and tension.

7. Suspense level: 5 - The reaction of the two men is understandable, but the pace of the story slows down a bit, and the suspense is somewhat reduced.

8. Suspense level: 4 - The prompt arrival of the doctors is a necessary step, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

9. Suspense level: 7 - The discovery of the ruptured interior bag raises the stakes and creates some tension, as the reader wonders if the organ is still usable.

10. Suspense level: 5 - The biopsy is a necessary step, but it's a bit of a procedural detail, and the suspense is somewhat reduced.

11. Suspense level: 6 - The analysis showing that the organ is still usable is a relief, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

12. Suspense level: 3 - The final outcome, where the transplant is successful, is a relief, but it's more of a resolution than a suspenseful moment.

Overall, the story has some suspenseful moments, particularly around the accident with the liver, but it's not a consistently suspenseful narrative.
