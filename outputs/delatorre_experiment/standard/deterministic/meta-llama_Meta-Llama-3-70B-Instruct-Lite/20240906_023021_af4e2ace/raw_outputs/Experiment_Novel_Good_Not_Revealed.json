Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm and procedural scene.

3. 4 - The description of the two men descending from the helicopter and rushing to deliver the organ creates a sense of urgency, but it's still a fairly routine scene. Suspense level is moderate.

4. 5 - The introduction of the cleaner and his mundane task creates a sense of normalcy, which makes the reader wonder what's about to disrupt this routine. Suspense level is 2.

5. 6 - The conversation between the two men and the decision to take the stairs creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene. Suspense level is 3.

6. 7 - The moment when the man slips and the case rolls down the stairs is a sudden and intense moment of suspense. Suspense level is 8.

7. 8 - The aftermath of the fall, with the two men frozen in horror, is a tense and suspenseful moment. Suspense level is 8.

8. 9 - The scene shifts to the cleaner, who is still frozen in place, and the arrival of the doctors creates a sense of urgency. Suspense level is 6.

9. 10 - The revelation that the case has been damaged and the liver may be compromised is a major plot twist, and the suspense level is 9.

10. 11 - The scene shifts to the laboratory, where the medical team is examining the liver, and the suspense level is high as the reader wonders if the liver is still viable. Suspense level is 8.

11. 12 - The biopsy procedure is a tense and suspenseful moment, and the reader is on edge wondering if the liver is damaged. Suspense level is 9.

12. 13 - The final resolution, where the liver is found to be functioning correctly, is a relief, and the suspense level drops to 1.
