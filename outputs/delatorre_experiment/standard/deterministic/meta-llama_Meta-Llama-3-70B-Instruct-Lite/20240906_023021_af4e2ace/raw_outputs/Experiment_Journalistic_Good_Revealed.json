I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested. Here are my ratings:

1. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph sets the scene and provides some background information, but it doesn't create much tension or suspense.

2. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a straightforward description of the helicopter's arrival, and it doesn't add much to the story in terms of suspense.

3. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is another descriptive passage that doesn't create much tension.

4. Suspense level: 3 - This paragraph introduces a potential hazard (the wet floor) that could lead to an accident, which creates some mild suspense.

5. Suspense level: 4 - The decision to use the service stairwell creates a sense of foreboding, and the reader starts to wonder if something might go wrong.

6. Suspense level: 8 - The accident finally happens, and the case containing the liver falls down the stairs, creating a sense of shock and tension.

7. Suspense level: 6 - The aftermath of the accident is described, and the reader is left wondering if the liver is still usable.

8. Suspense level: 2 - The doctors arrive promptly, but this paragraph doesn't add much to the suspense.

9. Suspense level: 7 - The discovery that the interior bag has ruptured creates a sense of concern and tension.

10. Suspense level: 5 - The biopsy is a necessary step, but it doesn't create much suspense on its own.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The analysis shows that the organ is still usable, which is a relief, but the reader is still worried about the outcome.

12. Suspense level: 1 - This final paragraph is a repetition of the initial statement, and it doesn't add much to the suspense.
