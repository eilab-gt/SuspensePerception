I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 5. This paragraph is a bit of a letdown after the intense suspense of the previous one.

The conversation between the two men is calm and rational, and the description of the hospital corridors is more of a transition than a source of tension. The suspense is still present, but it's more of a simmering concern about the potential consequences of the accident rather than an immediate threat.
