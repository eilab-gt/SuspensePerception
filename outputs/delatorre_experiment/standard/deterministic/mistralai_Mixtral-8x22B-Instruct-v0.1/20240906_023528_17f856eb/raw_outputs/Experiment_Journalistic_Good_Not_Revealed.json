 1 - 6: I would rate the suspense level as a 6. The story starts with a critical situation and the arrival of the liver adds to the tension. The suspense builds up as the men carrying the liver encounter an obstacle, which could potentially jeopardize the transplant.

7 - 9: I would rate the suspense level as a 7. The fact that the case was not handled and the doctors were promptly informed adds to the tension. The suspense reaches its peak when the doctors discover that the interior bag had ruptured.

10 - 12: I would rate the suspense level as a 5. The suspense slightly decreases as the doctors take the case to the hepatic laboratory and carry out a biopsy. However, the tension remains high until the final verification that the transplant was successful.
