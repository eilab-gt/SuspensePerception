The medical team was devastated by the loss of Robert Bent. They had done everything they could to save him, but it was not enough. The team was left with many questions and doubts about what had gone wrong. They knew that the organ had been damaged in transit, but they did not know the extent of the damage or how it had occurred.

The team decided to investigate the matter further and find out what had happened. They contacted the organ procurement organization (OPO) that had coordinated the donation and transport of the liver. The OPO informed them that the liver had been transported in a special container designed to keep it at the right temperature and humidity. The container was equipped with sensors that monitored the conditions inside and sent real-time data to the OPO.

The OPO also told the team that the liver had been transported by a commercial airline, as is often the case with organ transplants. The airline had strict protocols in place to ensure the safe transport of organs, including special handling procedures and priority boarding.

The team was puzzled. If everything had been done according to protocol, how could the liver have been damaged? They decided to look into the matter further and find out what had happened.

The team was relieved to see the helicopter arrive on time. They knew that every minute counted in a liver transplant, and they were eager to get started. However, their relief was short-lived. As they opened the container, they were shocked to see that the liver was badly damaged. It was clear that it could not be used for the transplant.

The team was devastated. They had been so close to saving Robert Bent, but now it seemed that all their efforts had been in vain. They knew that they had to act quickly to find another organ, but they also knew that the chances of finding a suitable donor in time were slim.

The team contacted the OPO again and asked if there were any other organs available. The OPO told them that there was another liver that had become available, but it was in a different state and would take several hours to transport. The team knew that they had no choice but to wait.

As they waited, the team could not help but wonder what had gone wrong. How could the liver have been damaged in transit? They knew that the container was designed to protect the organ, and that the airline had strict protocols in place. They decided to investigate further and find out what had happened.
