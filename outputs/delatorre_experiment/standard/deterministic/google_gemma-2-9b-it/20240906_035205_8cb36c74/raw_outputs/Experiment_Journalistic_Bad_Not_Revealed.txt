I'd rate the first paragraph a **6/9**. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The situation is immediately presented as critical, with Robert's life hanging in the balance.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of "imminent transplant" and "awaiting the arrival of the organ" creates a sense of urgency.
* **Mystery:**  While we know a donor has been found, there's a hint of uncertainty about whether Robert will make it through the wait.

I'd rate the second paragraph a **5/9**. 

Here's why:

* **Arrival:** The helicopter's arrival is a significant event, bringing hope but also raising the stakes as the transplant process begins.

However, it lacks the same level of emotional tension as the first paragraph, which established the critical nature of Robert's situation.
