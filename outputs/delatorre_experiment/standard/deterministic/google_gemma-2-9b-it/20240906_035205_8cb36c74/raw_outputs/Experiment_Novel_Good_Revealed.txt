I'd rate the first paragraph a **6/9**.

* **Uncertainty:** The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" introduces doubt and suspense about the outcome.

I'd rate the second paragraph a **5/9**. 

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The time stamp "08:57" reinforces the sense of urgency and the race against time.

However, it lacks the same level of emotional tension and uncertainty as the first paragraph.
