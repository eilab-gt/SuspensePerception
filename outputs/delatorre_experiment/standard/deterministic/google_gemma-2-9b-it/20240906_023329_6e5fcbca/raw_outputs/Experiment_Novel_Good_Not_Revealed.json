Here are my ratings for each paragraph's suspense level:

1. **2/9:**  This paragraph sets the scene and introduces the situation, but it's not particularly suspenseful yet.
2. **3/9:**  The arrival of the organ adds a sense of urgency, but it's still relatively calm.
3. **5/9:**  The description of the men carrying the organ and the emphasis on time creates some tension.
4. **1/9:** This paragraph is a complete detour and focuses on the cleaner, which doesn't contribute to the suspense surrounding the organ transplant.
5. **4/9:** The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift raises the stakes slightly.
6. **8/9:** The man slipping and the case falling is a major turning point, creating high suspense.
7. **7/9:** The uncertainty about the damage to the organ and the man's anxious wait heightens the tension.
8. **6/9:** The doctors arriving and examining the case adds to the suspense, but it's not as intense as the fall.
9. **9/9:** The doctor's discovery of the ruptured fridge and the potential for the liver to be damaged is incredibly suspenseful.
10. **7/9:** The examination of the liver and the surgeon's nervousness create a lot of tension.
11. **6/9:** The biopsy and the wait for the results keep the suspense going, but it's slightly less intense than the previous paragraph.
12. **3/9:** The resolution of the story brings a sense of relief, but it's not particularly suspenseful.
