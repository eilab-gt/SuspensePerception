Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **3/9:**  It sets the scene and introduces the high-stakes situation, but it's not yet gripping.
2. **4/9:** The arrival of the organ adds urgency and raises the stakes.
3. **6/9:**  The focus on the men carrying the organ, the time pressure, and the noisy environment create a sense of tension.
4. **2/9:** This paragraph is a bit of a lull, focusing on the cleaner's mundane routine.
5. **5/9:** The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a sense of potential danger.
6. **8/9:** The man's fall and the potential damage to the organ create a major cliffhanger.
7. **7/9:** The uncertainty about the organ's condition and the man's anxious waiting heightens the suspense.
8. **6/9:** The arrival of the doctors and the examination of the organ bring a sense of hope, but also a lingering fear.
9. **9/9:** The doctor's confirmation that the organ is damaged is a devastating blow.
10. **7/9:** The detailed description of the biopsy adds a layer of medical suspense.
11. **9/9:** The surgeon's nervousness and the slow reveal of the diagnosis create intense suspense.
12. **3/9:** The final confirmation of Robert's death brings a sense of closure, but the suspense has largely dissipated.
