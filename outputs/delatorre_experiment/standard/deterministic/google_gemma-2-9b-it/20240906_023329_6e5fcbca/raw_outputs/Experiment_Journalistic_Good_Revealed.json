Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **3/9:**  It sets up a situation with potential for drama (a critical child needing a transplant) but doesn't yet create strong suspense.
2. **4/9:**  The arrival of the organ adds urgency and raises the stakes.
3. **5/9:**  The introduction of the blue fridge and its contents makes the object of importance more tangible and vulnerable.
4. **6/9:**  The mention of the wet floor and missing sign introduces a potential hazard, increasing the sense of danger.
5. **7/9:**  The decision to use the service stairwell, knowing the risk, heightens the tension.
6. **8/9:**  The slip and fall is the turning point, creating a major obstacle and immediate concern.
7. **7/9:**  The split reaction of the men adds to the chaos and uncertainty.
8. **6/9:**  The prompt arrival of the doctors offers a glimmer of hope but the situation remains precarious.
9. **8/9:**  The ruptured bag is a major setback, raising the question of whether the transplant can still happen.
10. **5/9:**  The move to the lab introduces a sense of scientific investigation and potential for a solution.
11. **4/9:**  The positive biopsy result provides relief but the suspense isn't as high as before.
12. **3/9:**  The successful transplant provides a resolution and brings the story to a close.
