Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **2/9:**  This paragraph sets the scene and introduces the situation, but it's not particularly suspenseful yet.
2. **3/9:**  The arrival of the organ adds a sense of urgency, but it's still relatively calm.
3. **5/9:**  The description of the men carrying the organ and the emphasis on time pressure starts to build suspense.
4. **1/9:** This paragraph is a complete detour and actually lowers the suspense by focusing on a mundane task unrelated to the main plot.
5. **4/9:**  The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a small element of risk and raises the stakes.
6. **7/9:** The fall of the case is a major turning point and creates significant suspense about the fate of the liver.
7. **6/9:** The uncertainty about the damage and the man's anxious wait heighten the tension.
8. **5/9:** The arrival of the doctors and the examination of the case bring a sense of hope but also a lingering sense of worry.
9. **8/9:** The doctor's discovery of the ruptured fridge and the potential for damage creates intense suspense.
10. **7/9:** The detailed description of the examination and the surgeon's nervousness amplifies the tension.
11. **9/9:** The moment of truth with the biopsy results is the peak of suspense in the story.
12. **3/9:** The resolution of the suspense brings a sense of relief but also a slight decrease in tension.
