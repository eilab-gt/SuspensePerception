Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **6/9:**  The setup establishes a high-stakes situation with a time-sensitive medical emergency. The mention of a critical condition and the uncertainty of survival creates initial suspense.
2. **4/9:**  The arrival of the helicopter and the organ adds a sense of urgency, but the paragraph is mostly factual and lacks dramatic tension.
3. **3/9:**  The description of the liver case is straightforward and doesn't build much suspense.
4. **5/9:**  The introduction of the "wet floor" detail foreshadows potential danger and raises the stakes slightly.
5. **6/9:**  The decision to use the service stairwell adds a sense of risk and vulnerability.
6. **8/9:**  The slip and the case falling down the stairs is a sudden, dramatic event that creates significant suspense.
7. **7/9:**  The split reaction of the two men, one rushing to warn the doctors while the other stays with the case, heightens the tension.
8. **5/9:**  The prompt arrival of the doctors offers a glimmer of hope but doesn't fully resolve the suspense.
9. **9/9:**  The revelation that the bag has ruptured is a devastating blow and creates maximum suspense about Robert's fate.
10. **4/9:**  The move to the laboratory is a procedural step that doesn't significantly increase the suspense.
11. **8/9:**  The confirmation that the organ is unusable is a crushing blow and intensifies the suspense about Robert's survival.
12. **7/9:**  The final confirmation of Robert's death brings a tragic conclusion to the story, but the suspense is mostly resolved.
