I'd rate this paragraph a **6** in terms of suspense. 

The mention of a critical situation, a race against time, and the uncertainty surrounding Robert's survival definitely creates some tension and makes the reader want to know what happens next. 


Okay, I understand. I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph after reading it. Please go ahead and provide the first paragraph.  


I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspense.

The mention of a helicopter carrying a vital organ and the phrase "critical but stable condition" adds a sense of urgency and importance, but it's not yet highly suspenseful. We don't know enough about the situation to feel truly on edge. 


Okay, I'm ready for the next paragraph! 


I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspense.

It's a fairly straightforward description and doesn't introduce any immediate threats or complications. The mention of the "fully functioning liver" might create a slight sense of relief, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** for suspense.

I'd rate this paragraph a **8** for suspense.
