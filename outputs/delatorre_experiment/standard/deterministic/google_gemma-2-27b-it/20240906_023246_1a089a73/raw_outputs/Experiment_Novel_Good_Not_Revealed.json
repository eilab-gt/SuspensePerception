Here are the suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. **6:** The setup establishes a high-stakes situation, but it's still mostly exposition.
2. **4:**  The arrival of the organ is a key moment, but the paragraph is brief and lacks immediate tension.
3. **5:** The urgency is increased with the mention of the critical situation and the men's haste.
4. **2:** This paragraph introduces a seemingly unrelated character and a mundane task, creating a contrast that momentarily lowers the suspense.
5. **6:** The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a sense of risk and foreshadows potential trouble.
6. **8:** The fall and the sound of the case rolling down the stairs create a sudden and shocking moment of high suspense.
7. **7:** The uncertainty about the damage to the case and the urgency of the situation maintain a high level of suspense.
8. **7:** The man's pain and superstition, combined with the anticipation of the doctors' arrival, keep the tension high.
9. **9:** The revelation of the damaged case and the escaping air creates a devastating climax.
10. **8:** The delicate procedure and the high stakes create intense suspense.
11. **9:** The surgeon's nervousness and the close examination of the sample build up to a nail-biting moment.
