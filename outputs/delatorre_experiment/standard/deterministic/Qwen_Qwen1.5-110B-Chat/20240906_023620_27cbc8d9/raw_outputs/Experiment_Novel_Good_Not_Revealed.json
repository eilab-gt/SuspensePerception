The suspense in the story builds up gradually, starting with a relatively low suspense level as the background is set. It peaks around the moment the liver case falls down the stairs (paragraph 6), creating a sense of urgency and fear for the outcome. The suspense then fluctuates as the medical team assesses the damage and performs the biopsy, with the highest tension during the biopsy procedure itself (paragraph 11), as the surgeon's actions could mean life or death for the child. The story concludes with a decrease in suspense as the successful transplant is confirmed.
