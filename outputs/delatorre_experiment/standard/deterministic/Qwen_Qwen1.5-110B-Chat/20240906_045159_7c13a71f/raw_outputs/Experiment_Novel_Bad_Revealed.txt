The beginning of the story sets the stage for a medical drama, with a young patient and a life-saving operation on the horizon. The uncertainty of Robert's survival and the mention of a critical situation create some suspense, but it's not yet intense since it's just the introduction.

2 The liver was being transported by a medical courier on a private plane. The organ had been extracted from a donor in a hospital located in another state, and the flight was the fastest way to get it to Robert in time. The weather conditions were far from ideal, with a severe storm system covering most of the western United States, but the pilot was experienced and confident he could make the trip safely. The clock was ticking, and every minute counted.

Plane carrying critical transplant organ diverted due to extreme weather conditions.” The organ would have to be rerouted to another airport, adding precious hours to the already delicate operation timeline.
