I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph on a 9-point scale, where 1 is "not suspenseful" and 9 is "very suspenseful".

1. Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. Suspense level: 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

3. Suspense level: 4 - The sense of urgency is increased as the men rush to deliver the organ, but it's still a fairly routine scene.

4. Suspense level: 1 - This paragraph is a calm interlude, focusing on the cleaner's mundane task. It's a break from the tension of the previous scenes.

5. Suspense level: 5 - The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates some tension, and the reader senses that something might go wrong.

6. Suspense level: 8 - The man's foot slipping on the stairs and the case rolling down the stairs is a very suspenseful moment, as the reader fears for the safety of the organ.

7. Suspense level: 7 - The aftermath of the accident is tense, as the men wait to see if the organ is damaged.

8. Suspense level: 6 - The man's superstition and the wait for the doctors to arrive create some tension, but it's a relatively calm scene.

9. Suspense level: 9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the organ is damaged is a very suspenseful moment, as the reader fears for Robert's life.

10. Suspense level: 5 - The examination of the liver is a tense scene, but it's more of a medical procedure than a suspenseful plot twist.

11. Suspense level: 8 - The surgeon's nervousness and the risk of damaging the organ create a lot of tension in this scene.

12. Suspense level: 1 - The final paragraph is more of a conclusion than a suspenseful scene, as the outcome is already known.
