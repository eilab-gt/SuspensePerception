I'll rate the suspense level of each paragraph as you requested.

1. What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. This is the story of what happened.

Suspense level: 4 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the critical situation, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition.

Suspense level: 2 - This paragraph is more of a factual update, and there's no real sense of tension or suspense.

3. Two men descended from the helicopter, one of whom was carrying a small blue fridge, in the shape of a case, which stored the fully functioning liver.

Suspense level: 2 - Again, this is more of a descriptive passage, and there's no real sense of tension or suspense.

4. Minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign.

Suspense level: 6 - This paragraph introduces a potential hazard, and the reader starts to sense that something might go wrong.

5. The two men transporting the liver left the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell, which they decided to walk down.

Suspense level: 7 - The reader is now worried about the potential consequences of the wet floor, and the decision to walk down the stairs increases the sense of tension.

6. As a result, the moment the man carrying the case placed his foot on the steps he slipped, and the case plunged down the stairs.

Suspense level: 9 - This is the most suspenseful paragraph so far, as the reader's worst fears are realized, and the liver is put in danger.

7. His colleague immediately went to warn the doctors whilst he, after regaining his footing, stayed supervising the case, which was not handled
