Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm and procedural scene.

3. 4 - The description of the two men rushing to deliver the organ creates a sense of urgency, and the mention of the patient's critical condition adds to the tension.

4. 5 - The introduction of the cleaner's mundane routine creates a sense of normalcy, but the fact that he's not setting up "wet floor" signs creates a hint of foreboding.

5. 6 - The decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates a sense of urgency, and the mention of the patient's location on the 6th floor adds to the tension.

6. 8 - The man's foot slipping on the stairs and the case rolling down the stairs is a very suspenseful moment, as the reader is worried about the fate of the liver.

7. 7 - The aftermath of the fall, with the two men kneeling beside the case, is still suspenseful, as the reader is waiting to see if the liver is damaged.

8. 6 - The man's decision to stay with the case and his colleague's warning not to touch it adds to the tension, as the reader is still worried about the liver's condition.

9. 8 - The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the fridge has ruptured is a very suspenseful moment, as the reader realizes the gravity of the situation.

10. 5 - The description of the laboratory procedure is more procedural than suspenseful, but the mention of the enzyme activity and metabolic rate adds some tension.

11. 8 - The surgeon's nervousness and the description of the biopsy procedure creates a sense of tension, as the reader is worried about the outcome.

12. 1 - The final paragraph is more of a conclusion than a suspenseful passage, as the outcome is already known.
