Here are my suspense ratings for each paragraph:

1. 2 - The paragraph sets the scene and establishes the context, but it's more of an introduction than a suspenseful passage.

2. 3 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ creates some tension, but it's still a relatively calm and procedural scene.

3. 4 - The sense of urgency and time pressure is introduced, and the description of the men's actions creates a sense of tension.

4. 5 - The introduction of the cleaner and the service stairwell creates a sense of normalcy, but the lack of windows and the focus on the cleaner's routine makes the scene feel slightly ominous.

5. 6 - The men's decision to take the stairs and the mention of the patient's critical condition raises the stakes and creates tension.

6. 9 - The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a very suspenseful moment, as the reader is worried about the fate of the liver.

7. 8 - The aftermath of the fall and the men's reactions create a sense of tension and uncertainty.

8. 7 - The man's decision to stay with the case and his superstition about the liver's condition adds to the sense of tension and foreboding.

9. 9 - The revelation that the fridge has ruptured and the liver may be damaged is a very suspenseful moment.

10. 6 - The transfer of the liver to the laboratory and the uncertainty about its condition creates tension, but the focus on the medical procedures tempers the suspense slightly.

11. 8 - The surgeon's nervousness and the high stakes of the biopsy create a sense of tension and suspense.

12. 2 - The resolution of the story and the confirmation that the liver is functioning correctly is a relief, and the suspense is largely dissipated.
