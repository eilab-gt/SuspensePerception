I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph a 6. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the preparations for a critical medical procedure, and the uncertainty of the patient's survival. The mention of the organ's damage in transit adds a sense of foreboding, but the paragraph ultimately resolves the tension by revealing the outcome (Robert's death), which reduces the suspense.

I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph a 5. While the paragraph is still tense and urgent, the immediate crisis of the case rolling down the stairs has passed, and the men are now taking a more cautious and deliberate approach. The conversation between the two men is brief and to the point, and the description of the hospital corridors is more functional than suspenseful. The sense of urgency is still present, but it's more of a simmering tension rather than a boiling-over crisis. The reader is still invested in the story, but the paragraph doesn't quite have the same level of shock and surprise as the previous one.
