 1 (This paragraph sets the scene and provides background information, so it is not particularly suspenseful.)
2 (The helicopter has arrived with the organ, but there is no immediate danger or tension.)
3 (The men carrying the liver have arrived, but there is no indication of any problems yet.)
4 (The cleaner has finished mopping the floor, but this does not directly relate to the story and does not create suspense.)
5 (The men decide to take the stairs, but there is no immediate danger or tension.)
6 (The man slips on the stairs and drops the case, creating a moment of tension and potential danger.)
7 (His colleague goes to warn the doctors, adding to the sense of urgency and potential danger.)
8 (The doctors arrive promptly, but the situation remains tense and uncertain.)
9 (The doctors discover that the interior bag has ruptured, increasing the tension and potential danger.)
10 (The doctors take the case to the lab for analysis, but the outcome is still uncertain.)
11 (The analysis shows that the organ has withstood the impact, providing a moment of relief but the tension is not yet over.)
12 (The medical team verifies that the liver is functioning correctly, bringing the story to a successful conclusion but the suspenseful moment were in the previous paragraphs.

Overall, the passage is suspenseful because it describes a potentially dangerous situation (the liver falling down the stairs) and the uncertainty of whether the organ will be usable for the transplant. The tension builds as the men transport the liver and the moment of danger occurs when the man slips on the stairs. The suspense is maintained until the doctors confirm that the liver is functioning correctly.
