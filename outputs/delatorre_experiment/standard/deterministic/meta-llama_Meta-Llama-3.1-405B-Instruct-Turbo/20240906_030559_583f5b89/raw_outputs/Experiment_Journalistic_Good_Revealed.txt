I would rate the preceding paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph sets up a tense situation, with a young boy's life hanging in the balance as he awaits a liver transplant. The fact that his situation is critical and the medical team is unsure if he will survive the wait creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind. However, the paragraph also gives away the outcome of the story, stating that the transplant was successful, which reduces the overall suspense.

I would rate the preceding paragraph a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspense. The paragraph introduces a new element that creates a sense of potential danger: the wet floor without a warning sign. This implies that someone could slip and fall, and given the context of the story, it's possible that the person carrying the liver could be the one to slip, putting the entire transplant operation at risk. This creates a sense of tension and foreboding, making the paragraph quite suspenseful.
