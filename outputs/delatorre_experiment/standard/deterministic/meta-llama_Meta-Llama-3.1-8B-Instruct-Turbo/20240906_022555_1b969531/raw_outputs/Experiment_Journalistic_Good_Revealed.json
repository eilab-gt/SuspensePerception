Here are my ratings of the preceding paragraph's suspense level:

1. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is more of an introduction to the story, setting the scene and providing some background information. It's a calm and straightforward paragraph.

2. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is also quite straightforward, simply stating a fact about the helicopter landing on the roof of the hospital.

3. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is more of a descriptive passage, showing the two men carrying the liver case. It's not particularly suspenseful.

4. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is a minor detail about the cleaner not putting up a "wet floor" sign. It's not particularly relevant to the plot and doesn't create any tension.

5. Slightly suspenseful (3) - This paragraph introduces a potential problem, as the two men decide to walk down the service stairwell, which might be slippery.

6. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph is where the plot starts to thicken. The man carrying the case slips and the case plunges down the stairs, which creates a sense of danger and uncertainty.

7. Suspensful (7) - This paragraph raises the stakes, as the doctors are now aware of the potential problem and are waiting for the case to be brought to them.

8. Suspensful (8) - This paragraph creates a sense of anticipation, as the doctors are about to open the case and find out if the liver is still usable.

9. Very suspensful (9) - This paragraph is the most suspenseful of all, as the doctors open the case and discover that the interior bag has ruptured. This is a critical moment in the story, and the reader is left wondering if the liver is still usable.

10. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph creates a sense of tension, as the doctors take the case to the laboratory to study the condition of the liver.

11. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph raises the stakes, as the analysis shows that the liver has withstood the impact, but the reader is still left wondering if it will be usable for the transplant.

12. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is a repeat of the final sentence of the first paragraph, and doesn't add any new suspense or tension to the story.
