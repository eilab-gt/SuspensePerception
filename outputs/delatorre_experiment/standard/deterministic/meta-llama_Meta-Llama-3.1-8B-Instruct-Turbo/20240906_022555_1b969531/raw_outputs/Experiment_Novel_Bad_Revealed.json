Here are my ratings of the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. Suspense level: 2/9 (This paragraph is more of an introduction to the story and sets the scene, but it doesn't create much tension or suspense.)

2. Suspense level: 3/9 (This paragraph is still relatively calm and doesn't create much tension. The arrival of the helicopter is a significant event, but it's not particularly suspenseful.)

3. Suspense level: 5/9 (This paragraph starts to create a sense of urgency and tension. The two men are in a hurry, and the noise of the helicopter blades creates a sense of chaos. However, the situation is still relatively controlled.)

4. Suspense level: 1/9 (This paragraph is a calm and mundane description of a cleaner doing his job. It's a nice contrast to the tension of the previous paragraphs, but it's not particularly suspenseful.)

5. Suspense level: 4/9 (This paragraph starts to create a sense of tension as the two men discuss their plan of action. The mention of the patient's critical condition adds to the sense of urgency.)

6. Suspense level: 8/9 (This paragraph is a turning point in the story. The man's foot slips, and the case rolls down the stairs, creating a sense of chaos and danger. The reader is on the edge of their seat as they wonder what will happen to the liver.)

7. Suspense level: 9/9 (This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The two men are frozen in horror as they watch the case roll down the stairs, and the reader is left wondering if the liver has been damaged. The tension is palpable as they try to decide what to do next.)

8. Suspense level: 8/9 (This paragraph is still very suspenseful. The man is trying to think of anything except the possibility that the liver has been damaged, and the reader is left wondering if he will be able to overcome his superstition and take action.)

9. Suspense level: 9/9 (This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The doctor opens the case and reveals that the liver has been damaged, and the reader is left feeling a sense of dread and hopelessness.)

10. Suspense level: 6/9 (This paragraph is still suspenseful, but the tension has started to dissipate slightly. The reader knows that the liver has been damaged
