Here are my ratings of the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is more of an introduction to the story and sets the scene, but it doesn't create any tension or suspense.

2. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is a straightforward description of the helicopter landing and the organ being transported to the hospital. It's a necessary part of the story, but it's not suspenseful.

3. Slightly suspenseful (3) - This paragraph starts to create some tension as the two men are in a hurry and there's a sense of urgency, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

4. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is a description of the cleaner's mundane job and doesn't create any tension or suspense.

5. Slightly suspenseful (4) - This paragraph starts to create some tension as the two men are discussing the best way to get to the patient's room, but it's still a relatively calm scene.

6. Very suspenseful (8) - This paragraph is where the story starts to take a dramatic turn. The man's foot slips and the case rolls down the stairs, creating a sense of chaos and uncertainty.

7. Very suspenseful (8) - This paragraph is even more suspenseful than the previous one. The two men are holding their breath as they watch the case roll down the stairs, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

8. Suspenseful (6) - This paragraph is still suspenseful, but it's more of a slow-burning tension. The man is trying to think of anything except the possibility that the liver has been damaged, and the reader is left wondering if it's too late to save the patient.

9. Very suspenseful (9) - This paragraph is the most suspenseful one yet. The doctor opens the case and reveals that the liver has been damaged, and the reader is left feeling a sense of dread and hopelessness.

10. Suspenseful (7) - This paragraph is still suspenseful, but it's more of a slow-burning tension. The medical team is trying to determine the extent of the damage and whether the liver can still be used for the transplant.

11. Suspenseful (7) - This paragraph is still suspenseful, but it's more of a slow-burning tension. The surgeon is trying to carry out the biopsy and determine the metabolic rate of the liver,
