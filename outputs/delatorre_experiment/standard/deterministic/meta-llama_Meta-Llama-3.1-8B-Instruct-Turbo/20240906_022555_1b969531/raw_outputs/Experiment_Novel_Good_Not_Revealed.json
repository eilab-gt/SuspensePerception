Here are my ratings of the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. Not suspenseful (1) - This is an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the story, but it doesn't create any tension or suspense.

2. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is a straightforward description of the helicopter landing, but it doesn't have any elements that would create suspense.

3. Slightly suspenseful (3) - This paragraph introduces some tension as the two men are in a hurry and there's a sense of urgency, but it's not yet clear what the stakes are.

4. Not suspenseful (1) - This paragraph is a mundane description of a cleaner doing his job, and it doesn't have any elements that would create suspense.

5. Slightly suspenseful (4) - This paragraph starts to create some tension as the two men are hurrying to get to the patient, but it's still not clear what the consequences of their delay would be.

6. Very suspenseful (8) - This paragraph is where the plot starts to thicken, and the reader realizes that the case containing the liver is in danger of being damaged. The image of the case rolling down the stairs is vivid and creates a sense of tension.

7. Very suspenseful (8) - This paragraph is even more suspenseful than the previous one, as the two men are now worried that the liver may have been damaged and are trying to decide what to do next.

8. Suspenseful (6) - This paragraph is a bit more introspective, but it still creates a sense of tension as the man is worried about the liver and is trying to think of a way to mitigate the damage.

9. Very suspenseful (8) - This paragraph is a turning point in the story, as the doctor opens the case and reveals that the liver has been damaged. The image of the refrigerated air escaping is a good example of how the author uses sensory details to create tension.

10. Suspenseful (6) - This paragraph is still suspenseful, as the medical team is trying to determine the extent of the damage to the liver and whether it's still usable.

11. Very suspenseful (8) - This paragraph is a nail-biter, as the surgeon is trying to perform a biopsy on the liver and is worried about damaging it. The image of him holding his breath and wiping the sweat from his brow creates a sense of tension.

12. Very suspense
