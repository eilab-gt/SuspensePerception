The outcome of the story is also already revealed, which reduces the suspense.
The medical team had been preparing for this moment for days, but they knew that the next few hours would be crucial.

The tension in the room was palpable as the team waited for the first signs of the liver's function.

It's a mundane and unrelated detail that doesn't create any sense of tension or uncertainty. The mention of the service stairwell and the men walking down it seems to be a random and unconnected event.
The men's decision to walk down the service stairwell would have a profound impact on the outcome of the transplant, but at the time, it seemed like a routine choice. The team was too focused on the crisis at hand to notice the potential consequences of the men's actions.

The outcome is uncertain, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

I would rate the preceding paragraph a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. This paragraph is a devastating blow to the story, and it's a moment of intense shock and disappointment. The rupture of the interior bag is a catastrophic event that makes the situation even more dire, and it raises the stakes to a critical level. The reader is left wondering if Robert will survive, and the tension is at its highest point.
The interior bag had been designed to keep the liver cool and safe during transport, but its rupture meant that the organ had been exposed to the warm air and was now unusable.

The fact that the liver was able to withstand the impact and is still usable is a sudden and unearned resolution to the story, and it feels like a cop-out. The paragraph is not suspenseful because it's not a believable or coherent continuation of the plot.
I think there's been a mistake. The previous paragraph was a complete reversal of the story, and it didn't make sense. I think it's time to start fresh and create a new story that's actually suspenseful. Would you like to start a new story and I can help you create a suspenseful plot?
I would rate the preceding paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. This paragraph is a resolution to the story, and it's a happy ending.

The paragraph is more of a conclusion to the story rather than a suspenseful plot twist.
