I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and tension by mentioning that the helicopter carrying the organ has landed, implying that the transplant is about to take place. However, the use of the word "punctually" suggests a sense of routine and predictability, which reduces the suspenseful nature of the event.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of curiosity and tension by introducing a mysterious object (the small blue fridge) that is being carried by one of the men. The use of the word "case" to describe the fridge implies that it contains something important, but the fact that it's a fridge adds a sense of absurdity and unpredictability. This unexpected twist creates a sense of intrigue and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "What's inside the fridge?" and "Why is it being carried in a helicopter?" The suspense is heightened by the fact that the reader is not given any information about the contents of the fridge, leaving them to wonder and speculate.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sudden and unexpected turn of events, which is a key element of suspense. The fact that the man carrying the case slips and loses control of it creates a sense of tension and danger. The use of the word "plunged" to describe the case's descent down the stairs implies a sense of chaos and unpredictability, which adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and whether the case will be damaged or the liver will be compromised. The only thing that prevents this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's a relatively short and straightforward paragraph, and the suspense is not sustained for a long period of time.

The paragraph is more of a resolution to the previous suspenseful event, rather than a continuation of it, which makes it less suspenseful. Overall, the paragraph creates a sense of relief and resolution, rather than continued tension and suspense.
