The use of specific times and details, such as the date and the time the transplant was verified, also adds to the sense of factual reporting rather than suspenseful storytelling.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and tension by mentioning that the helicopter carrying the organ landed "punctually", implying that it arrived on time, but this could also be seen as a relief. However, the fact that Robert Bent is in a "critical but stable condition" still suggests that there is a risk of complications, and the reader is left wondering if the transplant will be successful. The brevity of the paragraph and the lack of explicit outcome also contribute to a moderate level of suspense.
