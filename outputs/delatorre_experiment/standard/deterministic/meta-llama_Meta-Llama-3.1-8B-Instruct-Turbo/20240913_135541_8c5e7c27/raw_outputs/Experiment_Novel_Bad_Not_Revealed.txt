I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. 

The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation by mentioning a critical situation and a wait for a life-saving transplant. However, it quickly reveals that the story is about a real event and provides a lot of background information, which reduces the suspense. The paragraph also doesn't create any tension or uncertainty, as it explicitly states that a suitable donor had been found the day before. To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could have created more uncertainty or tension before revealing the outcome.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph provides some information about the timing and the arrival of the helicopter, but it doesn't create much tension or uncertainty. The phrase "punctually" suggests that everything is going according to plan, which reduces the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" implies that he is still in a precarious situation, but the use of the word "stable" suggests that the situation is under control. To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could have created more uncertainty or tension, such as by mentioning a delay or a complication with the helicopter's arrival.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the scene of the helicopter landing and the two men rushing to deliver the liver. The use of vivid language, such as "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and "hair blown", helps to create a sense of chaos and urgency. The fact that the men are in a hurry and have been told that the patient is in a critical situation adds to the sense of tension. However, the paragraph doesn't create a sense of uncertainty or unpredictability, as the outcome of the situation is still somewhat predictable. The men are clearly on a mission to deliver the liver, and the reader can infer that they will succeed. To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could have introduced some unexpected twist or complication, such as a problem with the liver or a delay in the delivery.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

This paragraph is a calm and mundane description of a cleaner's daily routine. The use of phrases such as "it wasn't a particularly interesting job" and "it was an agreeable job" reinforces the idea that the scene is ordinary and uneventful. The description of the service stairwell and the cleaner's actions is detailed and matter-of-fact, but it doesn't create any sense of tension or uncertainty. The paragraph is more of a character study of the cleaner and a description of his daily routine, rather than a suspenseful scene. The only hint of potential tension is the fact that the cleaner didn't put up the "wet floor" warning signs, but this is quickly resolved as the paragraph states that he finished mopping in 15 minutes and continued his day as usual. Overall, the paragraph is a calm and uneventful description of a daily routine.

I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the two men rushing to deliver the liver. However, the tension is quickly resolved as the second man catches his colleague's arm and suggests taking the stairs instead of the lift. This decision seems to be a practical one, and the paragraph doesn't create any sense of uncertainty or unpredictability. The use of the phrase "realising his colleague's intention" suggests that the second man is aware of his colleague's plan, but this doesn't create any sense of surprise or tension. The paragraph is more of a straightforward description of the men's actions, and the tension is quickly dissipated. To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could have introduced some unexpected twist or complication, such as a problem with the lift or a sudden change in the situation.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the man's accident on the stairs. The use of phrases such as "his foot slipped" and "he couldn't stay upright" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that the man has to let go of the case to grab the bannister adds to the tension, as it creates a sense of uncertainty about the fate of the liver. The image of the case rolling down the stairs, making a noise like "a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag", is particularly effective in creating a sense of suspense. The use of the phrase "the two men held their breath" also adds to the tension, as it suggests that the outcome of the situation is uncertain and that the men are on edge. The only thing that prevents this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that the outcome of the situation is still somewhat predictable, and the reader can infer that the men will likely be able to recover the case.

The paragraph is more of a straightforward description of the men's actions, and the tension is quickly dissipated. To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could have introduced some unexpected twist or complication, such as a problem with the medical team or a delay in their response.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the man's anxiety about the possibility of the liver being damaged. The use of phrases such as "the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall" and "he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange" creates a sense of uncertainty and concern. However, the paragraph quickly resolves the tension by having the doctors arrive, which suggests that the situation is under control. The use of the phrase "Directly, three doctors appeared" creates a sense of suddenness and urgency, but the arrival of the doctors also reduces the suspense.

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the doctor's examination of the liver and the revelation that it has been damaged. The use of phrases such as "the fridge had ruptured with the impact" and "a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping" creates a sense of disaster and failure.
