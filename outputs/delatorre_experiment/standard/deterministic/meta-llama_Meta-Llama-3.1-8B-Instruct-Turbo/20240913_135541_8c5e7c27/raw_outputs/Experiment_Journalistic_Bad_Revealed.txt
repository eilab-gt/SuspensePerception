I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. 

The paragraph starts by setting up a sense of anticipation and expectation, hinting that something significant and potentially life-changing is about to happen. However, the tone quickly shifts to one of tragedy and loss, which reduces the suspenseful impact. The use of phrases like "his situation was critical" and "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of tension, but the revelation that Robert dies before the transplant can be performed ultimately deflates the suspense. 

The paragraph's suspensefulness is also somewhat diminished by the fact that the outcome is explicitly stated from the beginning, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen. Overall, while the paragraph does create some tension, it does not build to a dramatic or unexpected conclusion, which is a key element of suspenseful storytelling.

Overall, the paragraph is more quirky and attention-grabbing than suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

This paragraph is somewhat of a relief after the sudden and dramatic event in the previous paragraph. The fact that the colleague goes to warn the doctors suggests that the situation is being taken seriously, but the tone is more one of caution and prudence than high-stakes suspense. The image of the man regaining his footing and staying supervising the case is a more mundane and reassuring action, and the fact that the case is not handled until the doctors arrive suggests that the situation is being carefully managed. While the paragraph does create some tension, it is more of a "holding pattern" than a dramatic or suspenseful moment.
