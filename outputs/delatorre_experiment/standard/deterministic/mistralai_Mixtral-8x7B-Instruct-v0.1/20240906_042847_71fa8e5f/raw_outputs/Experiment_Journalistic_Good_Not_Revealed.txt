The hospital had a special team on standby, ready to rush the liver to the operating room as soon as it arrived.

Paragraph 3:

Suddenly, the phone rang. It was the pilot of the plane carrying the liver. There was a problem. The organ had been delayed at the airport where it was being transferred to a smaller plane for the final leg of its journey. The pilot couldn’t say how long the delay would be, but it was clear that it would be more than just a few minutes. The medical team at the hospital went into overdrive, trying to figure out what to do. Should they delay the surgery and hope that the liver would arrive in time? Or should they go ahead and start the surgery without the new liver, and then try to transplant it as soon as it arrived?

It wouldn’t work. Robert would die.
