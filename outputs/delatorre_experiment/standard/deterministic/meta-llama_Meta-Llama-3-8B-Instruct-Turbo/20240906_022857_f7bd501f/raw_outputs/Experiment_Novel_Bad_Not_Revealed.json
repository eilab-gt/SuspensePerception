Here are my ratings for the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. 2/9 - This paragraph sets the stage for the story, but it's more of a setup than a suspenseful introduction.

2. 4/9 - The arrival of the helicopter and the organ is a crucial moment in the story, but it's still a relatively calm and predictable scene.

3. 5/9 - The two men's conversation and actions are starting to create a sense of tension and urgency, but it's still not extremely suspenseful.

4. 1/9 - This paragraph is a nice break from the action, but it's a relatively mundane and uneventful description of a hospital cleaner's daily routine.

5. 6/9 - The two men's decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator creates a sense of tension and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder what might happen.

6. 8/9 - The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs is a dramatic and suspenseful moment, making the reader worry about the fate of the organ.

7. 9/9 - The two men's reactions to the case's fall and their decision to call the doctors creates a sense of high stakes and raises the tension to a near-maximum level.

8. 8/9 - The man's superstition and the doctors' arrival create a sense of urgency and tension, making the reader wonder what will happen next.

9. 9/9 - The doctor's examination of the case and the revelation that the organ has been damaged creates a sense of shock and raises the stakes to a critical level.

10. 7/9 - The medical team's efforts to save Robert's life create a sense of tension and urgency, but the outcome is still uncertain.

11. 8/9 - The surgeon's nervousness and the tension surrounding the biopsy create a sense of suspense, making the reader wonder if the organ will be damaged.

12. 9/9 - The final revelation that Robert has died due to the damage to the organ is a devastating and suspenseful conclusion to the story.
