Here are my ratings for the suspense level of each paragraph:

1. Not suspensful (1) - This is an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the story, but it doesn't have any suspenseful elements.

2. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is just a straightforward description of the helicopter landing and the organ being carried out.

3. Suspensful (5) - The scene is set for a potential disaster, with the organ being carried down the stairs and the risk of damage.

4. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is a non-essential description of the hospital's service stairwell and the cleaner's routine.

5. Suspensful (6) - The organ is being carried down the stairs, and there's a risk of damage or loss.

6. Very suspensful (9) - The organ falls down the stairs, and the men are in a state of panic, wondering if it's been damaged.

7. Suspensful (7) - The men are trying to assess the damage to the organ, and there's a sense of uncertainty and tension.

8. Suspensful (6) - The man is trying to think of anything except the possibility that the organ has been damaged, and there's a sense of foreboding.

9. Suspensful (7) - The doctor opens the case and finds that the organ has been damaged, which raises the stakes and creates tension.

10. Suspensful (6) - The medical team is trying to assess the condition of the organ, and there's a sense of urgency and tension.

11. Suspensful (7) - The surgeon is performing a biopsy, and there's a sense of high stakes and tension.

12. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is just a straightforward description of the outcome, and there's no suspense or tension.

Overall, the story builds up to a suspenseful climax, but the tension is released once the outcome is revealed.
