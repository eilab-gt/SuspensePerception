Here are my ratings for each paragraph:

1. Not suspensful (1) - This is an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for the story, but it's not particularly suspenseful.

2. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is just a straightforward description of the helicopter landing and the medical team waiting for the organ.

3. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is just a description of the two men and the liver case, and doesn't add any tension or suspense.

4. Slightly suspensful (4) - This paragraph mentions the cleaner not putting up the "wet floor" sign, which could potentially lead to an accident, but it's not a major plot point yet.

5. Slightly suspensful (4) - This paragraph shows the two men walking down the stairs, which could potentially lead to an accident, but it's not clear what will happen yet.

6. Very suspensful (8) - This is the moment where the accident happens, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to the liver and Robert Bent.

7. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph shows the doctors being warned about the accident, but the reader is still left wondering what will happen to the liver and Robert Bent.

8. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is just a straightforward description of the doctors arriving.

9. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph shows the doctors opening the case and discovering that the interior bag has ruptured, which is a major plot twist.

10. Not suspensful (1) - This paragraph is just a description of the doctors taking the case to the laboratory and the surgeon performing a biopsy.

11. Suspensful (6) - This paragraph shows the analysis of the liver and the possibility of using it for the transplant, which is a major plot point.

12. Not suspensful (1) - This final paragraph is just a description of the transplant being successful, and doesn't add any tension or suspense.

Overall, the story builds up to a suspenseful moment when the liver case falls down the stairs, and then there are a few more suspenseful moments as the reader waits to see what will happen to the liver and Robert Bent. However, the story is not consistently suspenseful throughout.
