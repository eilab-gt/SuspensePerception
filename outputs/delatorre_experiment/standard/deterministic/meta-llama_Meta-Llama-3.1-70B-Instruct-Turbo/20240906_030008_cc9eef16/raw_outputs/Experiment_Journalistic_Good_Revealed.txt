I would rate the suspense level of this paragraph as a 6. The paragraph sets up a critical situation where a young boy's life is at stake, and the outcome is uncertain. The mention of the liver transplant and the potential damage to the organ creates tension, but the fact that the story is presented as a "real event" and the outcome is already known (the liver is functioning correctly) reduces the suspense level.

2 The boy had been suffering from a rare liver disease, and his condition had deteriorated rapidly over the past few months. His parents had been told that without a transplant, he would not survive. The medical team had been searching for a suitable donor for months, and finally, they had found one. However, the donor liver had been damaged during transport, and the medical team was not sure if it would be viable for the transplant.
