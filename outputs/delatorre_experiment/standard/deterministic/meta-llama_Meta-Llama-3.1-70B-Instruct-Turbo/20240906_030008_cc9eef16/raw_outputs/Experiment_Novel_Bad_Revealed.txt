This paragraph is a stark contrast to the previous ones, which were building up tension and suspense. The introduction of the cleaner and his mundane routine completely shifts the focus away from the critical situation with Robert Bent and the liver transplant. The description of the cleaner's job and his thoughts is detailed and ordinary, making the reader feel like nothing out of the ordinary is happening. The lack of connection to the main plot and the absence of any tension or conflict make this paragraph feel like a non-sequitur, and the suspense level drops to almost zero.

This paragraph brings the focus back to the liver transplant and the men carrying the organ, and raises the stakes again. The mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the decision to take the stairs instead of the lift creates a sense of urgency and time pressure. The fact that every minute counts and the men are trying to save time adds to the tension. However, the situation is still relatively under control, and the men seem to be making rational decisions, which prevents the suspense from reaching its peak.

Suspense rating: 9

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as it introduces a sudden and unexpected twist that puts the entire situation at risk. The man's foot slipping and the case rolling down the stairs creates a sense of chaos and unpredictability, and the description of the case spinning and making a noise like loose keys being shaken in a bag adds to the tension. The fact that the men are holding their breath and watching in horror implies that the situation is dire, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether the organ will be damaged beyond use. The suspense is at its peak, as the outcome is uncertain and the stakes are extremely high.

Suspense rating: 8

This paragraph is still suspenseful, as the situation is still critical and the outcome is uncertain. The men's caution and decision to call the doctors before touching the case again adds to the tension, and the reader is left wondering if the organ has been damaged beyond use. The fact that the man rushes to alert the medical team creates a sense of urgency, and the reader is eager to know what will happen next. However, the suspense is slightly reduced compared to the previous paragraph, as the immediate danger of the case rolling down the stairs has passed, and the situation is now being addressed. The tension is still high, but it's more of a "waiting to see what happens next" kind of suspense rather than a "something is happening right now" kind of suspense.

Suspense rating: 1

This paragraph is not suspenseful at all, as it's a straightforward statement of the outcome, and the suspense has already been resolved in the previous paragraph. The reader already knows that the liver is damaged and the transplant won't happen, so the announcement of Robert Bent's death is more of a tragic conclusion to the story rather than a suspenseful revelation. The suspense has been building up throughout the story, but it's now been released, and the reader is left with a sense of sadness and finality rather than tension or anticipation.
