I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by setting the scene for a potentially life-saving medical procedure, and then subverts the reader's expectations by revealing that the patient dies before the transplant can take place. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the patient's death, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story more compelling.

However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it included more dramatic language or hints at the uncertainty and urgency of the situation. For example, the author could have emphasized the gravity of Robert's condition, or described the emotions of the medical team as they waited for the donor organ to arrive. Additionally, the paragraph could benefit from a more dramatic conclusion, such as a sense of shock or tragedy, rather than simply stating the facts of the situation.
