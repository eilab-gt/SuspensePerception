I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by stating it's a true story. The setting (a children's hospital) and the stakes (a life-saving transplant) create a sense of urgency.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph highlights the critical nature of Robert's condition and the uncertainty surrounding his survival. The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" effectively introduces doubt and raises the question of whether the transplant will be in time.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a clear and present danger described in this paragraph. We don't see any immediate obstacles or threats to Robert's life. This prevents it from reaching a higher level of suspense.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* Introduce a specific complication or unexpected event.
* Focus on Robert's emotional state and his fear of not surviving.
* Hint at a potential problem with the donor organ or the transplant procedure.
