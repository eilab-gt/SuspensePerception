I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph highlights the uncertainty surrounding Robert's survival, making the reader wonder if he will make it through the wait.

**What's Missing:**

* **Emotional Hook:**  We don't get a strong sense of Robert's personality or emotions, which could make the reader more invested in his fate.


Overall, the paragraph sets up a suspenseful situation, but it could be heightened with more specific details and emotional depth.
