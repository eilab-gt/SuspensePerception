 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the description of the helicopter carrying the organ landing on the hospital roof, it lacks the context and build-up necessary to create a truly suspenseful atmosphere. The reader is not given any information about the urgency of the situation or the significance of the organ being transported, so the landing of the helicopter does not have the same impact as it could have. Additionally, the fact that the boy is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that there is less of a sense of urgency than in the previous paragraph. Overall, while the paragraph does contain some elements of suspense, it does not fully engage the reader and create a sense of anticipation.
