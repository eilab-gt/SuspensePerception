This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a precise and critical moment in the story—the arrival of the helicopter with the donor organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival by helicopter on the hospital roof creates a sense of urgency and importance. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the situation is precarious, which can heighten the reader's concern for his well-being. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the arrival is described as punctual, which implies a degree of control and predictability in the situation. Overall, the paragraph maintains the reader's interest and concern for the outcome, but it does not escalate the tension to the same degree as the first paragraph.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense. The vivid description of the men descending from the helicopter with the critical organ in a blue case, the urgency conveyed by their actions, and the sensory details of the wind and noise from the rotors all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The specific mention of the liver being kept at a precise temperature to maintain its functionality adds to the stakes, emphasizing the delicate nature of the operation. The inaudible shouting and the gesture towards the watch and doorway convey a race against time, which is confirmed by the statement that the patient is in a critical situation and there is no time to lose. The combination of these elements creates a strong sense of urgency and anticipation, leaving the reader eager to know what happens next.

This paragraph introduces a level of suspense through the mundane routine of a hospital cleaner, which contrasts with the high-stakes medical drama unfolding elsewhere in the hospital. The detail about the cleaner not placing "wet floor" signs creates a sense of potential danger that could disrupt the urgent delivery of the liver. The reader may anticipate a possible accident or delay due to the wet floors, which adds a layer of tension. However, the suspense is more subtle and less immediate compared to the previous paragraphs that dealt directly with the transplant operation. The cleaner's routine and his preference for the more sociable corridor cleaning provide background context that could be relevant to the main plot but on their own, these details do not create a strong sense of imminent danger or urgency. Therefore, while there is a sense of foreboding that something could go wrong, the suspensefulness of this paragraph is relatively mild.

This paragraph raises the suspense level by presenting a potential obstacle in the critical path of the liver delivery. The specific details about the layout of the hospital and the decision to use the stairs instead of the elevator create a sense of urgency and strategy in the characters' actions. The reader is aware of the importance of time and the potential consequences if the liver does not reach its destination quickly enough. The mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the choice to take the stairs to save time adds to the tension, as it implies a close race against the clock. The physicality of the man holding the bannister with his free hand while carrying the precious cargo also contributes to the vividness of the scene and the reader's engagement with the characters' mission. The suspense is heightened by the anticipation of what might happen as they navigate the stairs and corridors to reach the patient in time.

The doctor's head shake, a clear non-verbal signal of bad news, is a powerful suspense-building element that signals a negative outcome to the reader. The specific detail of the ruptured "small padded fridge" with refrigerated air escaping paints a vivid picture of the damage and the potential implications for the liver's viability. This moment is critical, as it directly affects the life of the young boy awaiting the transplant. The suspense is heightened by the finality of the case being closed, leaving the reader with a sense of dread and uncertainty about what will happen next, now that the organ may no longer be usable.
