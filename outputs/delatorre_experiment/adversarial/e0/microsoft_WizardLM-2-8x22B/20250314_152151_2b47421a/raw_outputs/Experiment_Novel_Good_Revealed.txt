The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene with a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the donor organ's arrival being uncertain and the boy's life hanging in the balance creates a sense of urgency and tension. The specific details, such as the time of the final verification of the liver's function, add to the suspense by highlighting the precision and high stakes of the situation. The reader is left curious about the events that transpired during the wait and the outcome of the transplant, which contributes to a high level of suspense. However, since the paragraph concludes with the information that the liver was functioning correctly, some of the suspense is resolved, which is why it might not score a full 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph contributes to the suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—and emphasizing punctuality, which suggests that every second counts. The mention of Robert Bent's condition being "critical but stable" adds to the tension, as it implies that there is still a significant risk involved. The reader is likely to feel a sense of urgency and relief that the organ has arrived on time, but also anticipation for what comes next in this precarious situation. The suspense is moderate because the paragraph provides a positive development (the organ's arrival) but still leaves many questions unanswered regarding the outcome of the transplant and Robert's condition.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the intense and time-sensitive scenario of the organ delivery, with rich details that paint a cinematic picture.

The blue case is a focal point, carrying the precious cargo that must be kept at a precise temperature to remain viable. The inaudible shouting and non-verbal communication between the men add to the tension, suggesting the high stakes and the need for haste. The nod and the movement towards the exit convey a sense of purpose and the understanding that every moment counts. The mention of the patient's critical condition reinforces the urgency and the potential for a life-or-death outcome. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader on edge, wondering if the liver will reach the patient in time and in good condition.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine job at the hospital, focusing on the mundane aspects of his work and the environment in which he operates. The description of the cleaner's actions and thoughts is more focused on character development and setting the scene rather than building tension. While there is a hint of potential danger due to the absence of "wet floor" signs, which could lead to an accident, the paragraph lacks immediate stakes or a sense of impending doom that would typically contribute to suspense. The reader might anticipate that the cleaner's actions could have future consequences, but without a clear connection to the critical situation of the patient awaiting the transplant, the suspense remains low.

This paragraph provides a resolution to the suspense built up throughout the previous sections of the narrative. By confirming that Robert Bent's transplanted liver is functioning correctly and was not affected by the earlier mishap, it offers a sense of relief and closure. While the word "finally" and the specific time given (21:26) do convey a sense of the conclusion of a long and tense wait, the suspense is significantly reduced because the outcome is positive and the main source of tension—the viability of the liver—has been resolved. The reader's anxiety about the potential negative consequences of the organ's rough handling is alleviated, which lowers the suspense level. This paragraph serves more as a satisfying conclusion to the suspenseful events rather than a continuation of them.
