This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—and emphasizes punctuality, which suggests that every second counts. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" maintains tension, as it implies that his condition could quickly change for the worse. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the location (the roof of the hospital) contributes to a sense of immediacy. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually," which may signal to the reader that things are going according to plan, potentially reducing the sense of jeopardy. Overall, the paragraph maintains a level of suspense by keeping the focus on the critical nature of the situation.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the intense and time-sensitive process of transferring the liver from the helicopter to the hospital. The imagery of the men descending from the helicopter with the critical organ in tow, the noise and chaos of the rotors still spinning, and the urgency conveyed through their actions and the inaudible shouting all contribute to a gripping scene. The specific detail of the blue case maintaining the liver at a precise temperature for functionality adds to the gravity of the situation. The gesture of pointing at the watch and then at the doorway conveys a clear message of urgency, reinforcing the critical nature of the mission. The final sentence, which reiterates the patient's dire condition and the need for haste, leaves the reader on edge, wondering if the team will successfully deliver the liver in time to save Robert's life.

This paragraph contains elements that contribute to a sense of foreboding, which is a component of suspense, but it does not reach the same level of intensity as the previous paragraphs. The mundane task of the cleaner mopping the floors contrasts with the high-stakes medical drama unfolding elsewhere in the hospital. The detail about the cleaner not using "wet floor" signs introduces a potential hazard that could have consequences, especially in a situation where speed is critical. The mention of the service stairwell being unused and the cleaner's preference for the more social environment of the corridors sets the scene for a possible incident. However, the suspense is diluted by the lack of immediate tension or a direct connection to the urgent situation with Robert and the liver transplant. The paragraph is more about setting the stage for a potential conflict or accident rather than delivering a heart-stopping moment.

This paragraph builds suspense by detailing the path the men must take to deliver the liver to the patient, highlighting the urgency of their mission. The specificity of the route—through the service stairwell, past the central archives and storeroom, and the mention of the doctors' rooms and the east wing lift—creates a vivid picture of the environment and the navigation required. The decision to use the stairs instead of waiting for the lift introduces a sense of immediacy and a strategic choice to save time, emphasizing the critical nature of the situation. The reader is aware of the potential danger of the wet floors from the previous paragraph, which adds an undercurrent of tension as the men prepare to descend the stairs with the precious cargo. The suspense is heightened by the reader's knowledge of the potential hazard that the characters are about to encounter, creating anticipation and concern for the outcome of their urgent mission.

The critical moment when he must choose between holding onto the bannister or the case containing the liver adds to the suspense, as the reader is acutely aware of the importance of the case and its contents. The visual of the case tumbling down the stairs, accompanied by the unsettling sound of it hitting each step, heightens the tension and leaves the reader anxiously awaiting the outcome. The men's reaction of holding their breath in horror underscores the gravity of the situation, effectively conveying the sense of urgency and the potential for disaster.

This paragraph reaches a peak of suspense as the doctor examines the case containing the liver. The detailed description of the doctor opening the case, the anticipatory silence of the onlookers, and the simple yet powerful gesture of the doctor shaking his head create a moment of high tension. The revelation that the refrigerated container within the case has been ruptured, with refrigerated air escaping, signals a potential catastrophe. This moment is fraught with dramatic irony, as the reader, along with the characters present, understands the gravity of the situation—the liver must be kept at a precise temperature to remain viable for transplant. The suspense is at its maximum here, as the reader is left to infer the implications of the damaged container on the young patient's life, and the next steps the medical team will need to take in this critical situation.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful, as it describes the critical medical procedures that will determine the viability of the liver for transplant. The careful transfer of the organ to the hepatology laboratory and the initial signs that the liver may still be usable create a sense of cautious optimism. However, this is quickly overshadowed by the high stakes of the situation: the life of a child hangs in the balance, and the success of the biopsy is crucial. The detailed account of the surgeon's preparation, the precision required for the procedure, and the tension in the room as everyone steps back to give him space, all contribute to a nerve-racking atmosphere. The surgeon's own nervousness and the knowledge that even a minor mistake could be catastrophic heighten the suspense to a near-unbearable level. The reader is left on tenterhooks, waiting for the outcome of the biopsy and its implications for the young patient's future.

The surgeon's physical reactions—wiping sweat from his brow and pursing his lips—convey the immense pressure of the situation. The use of time, with the surgeon taking an "interminable half a minute" to examine the sample, effectively draws out the suspense. The revelation of the organ's deterioration due to the impact is a devastating blow, and the surgeon's concerned look at his colleagues underscores the gravity of the situation. The reader is left with a sense of impending doom, as the viability of the liver for transplant has been compromised, and the young patient's life is at stake.

This paragraph delivers a powerful and suspenseful conclusion to the narrative by confirming the tragic outcome of the events described. The specific time of death (21:26) adds a stark and somber note to the finality of the situation. The phrase "without having been able to carry out the liver transplant" is a poignant reminder of the high stakes and the intense efforts that were ultimately in vain. The mention of the damage the organ sustained in transit serves as a cruel twist of fate, given the meticulous planning and urgency that characterized the mission to save Robert's life. The suspense in this paragraph is derived from the confirmation of the worst fears that have been building throughout the narrative, and the abrupt end to the young boy's life leaves the reader with a profound sense of loss and the emotional weight of the story's conclusion.
