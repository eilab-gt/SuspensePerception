I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The mention of uncertainty about whether he would survive the wait creates tension. The specific details (date, location, and the boy's name) add a sense of realism and immediacy.
  
- **Areas for improvement**: While the stakes are high, the paragraph doesn't delve deeply into the emotional or physical struggles of the characters, nor does it introduce any unexpected twists or immediate threats. The suspense could be heightened by more vivid descriptions of the ticking clock, the boy's condition, or the challenges faced by the medical team.

Overall, itâ€™s a solid setup for suspense but could be more gripping with additional details or a sense of urgency.
