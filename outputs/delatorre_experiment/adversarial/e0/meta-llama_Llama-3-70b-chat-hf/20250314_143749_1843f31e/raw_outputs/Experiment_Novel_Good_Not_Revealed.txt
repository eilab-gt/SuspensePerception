I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts with a hook that grabs the reader's attention: "What you are about to read is the story of a real event..." This creates a sense of intrigue and makes the reader curious.
* The setup of the story is well-done, establishing the context and stakes of the situation: a young boy is waiting for a liver transplant, and his situation is critical.
* The use of specific details like the date, time, and location adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more urgent.
* The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" creates tension and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder if Robert will make it.

However, the paragraph doesn't quite reach a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness because:

* The tone is more matter-of-fact and informative than suspenseful or ominous. The language is straightforward and lacks a sense of foreboding or menace.
* The paragraph doesn't end with a cliffhanger or a dramatic twist, which would increase the sense of suspense and make the reader more eager to keep reading.
* The sentence "This is the story of what happened" feels a bit like a letdown, as it's a fairly bland way to conclude the paragraph. A more suspenseful ending might leave the reader with more questions or a greater sense of anticipation.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph provides a sense of progression and movement in the story, which can help build tension and anticipation.
* The use of a specific time (08:57) adds to the sense of realism and creates a sense of urgency.
* The image of a helicopter landing on the roof of the hospital is a dramatic and intense one, which can help create a sense of excitement and suspense.

However, the paragraph doesn't quite reach a higher rating for suspensefulness because:

* The tone is still fairly matter-of-fact and lacks a sense of foreboding or menace.
* The phrase "critical but stable condition" is somewhat reassuring, which reduces the sense of tension and suspense.
* The paragraph doesn't introduce any new conflicts or complications, and the landing of the helicopter is a expected event given the setup of the previous paragraph. This lack of surprise or unexpected twist reduces the sense of suspense.
* The sentence is fairly short and simple, which doesn't create a sense of building tension or anticipation.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a vivid and intense scene, with the rotors still turning, the men descending from the helicopter, and the whirlwind of the spinning blades. This creates a sense of urgency and energy.
* The introduction of the blue case containing the liver raises the stakes and creates a sense of importance and gravity.
* The use of sensory details like the inaudible shout, the touch on the shoulder, and the pointing at the watch and doorway creates a sense of immediacy and tension.
* The phrase "they had no time to lose" explicitly states the urgency of the situation, which increases the sense of suspense.
* The paragraph creates a sense of movement and progression, with the men hurrying towards the exit, which adds to the sense of tension and anticipation.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that:

* The paragraph is still fairly descriptive and lacks a sense of surprise or unexpected twist. The events are unfolding as expected, which reduces the sense of suspense slightly.
* The tone is still fairly objective and lacks a sense of emotional intensity or personal investment. The reader is not yet fully invested in the characters or the outcome, which reduces the sense of suspense.

Overall, however, this paragraph does an excellent job of creating a sense of tension and urgency, and is very effective at building suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is largely descriptive and focuses on the mundane details of the cleaner's job, which creates a sense of normalcy and routine.
* The tone is relaxed and matter-of-fact, with the cleaner whistling as he works, which reduces any sense of tension or suspense.
* The description of the service stairwell and the cleaner's tasks is detailed but uneventful, which makes the paragraph feel slow-paced and unengaging.
* There is no sense of conflict, danger, or urgency in the paragraph, which are all key elements of suspense.
* The paragraph doesn't seem to be building towards anything or setting up a dramatic event, which makes it feel like a tangent or a digression from the main story.

* The paragraph does create a sense of atmosphere and setting, which could potentially be used to build tension or suspense later on.
* The detail about the cleaner not bothering to position the "wet floor" warning signs could potentially be important later on, although it's not clear how at this point.
