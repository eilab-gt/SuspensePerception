  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The paragraph starts with a vague and general statement about Francisco and a children's story, which doesn't create much suspense on its own.
2. The second sentence introduces the setting of the story, which is a hospital in San Francisco, but doesn't provide any information that would make the reader curious or concerned.
3. The third sentence reveals that the story is about a boy named Robert who is in the hospital for a liver transplant, which is a serious medical procedure. This is the first indication that something suspenseful might happen in the story.
4. The fourth sentence creates a sense of urgency by stating that the medical team is waiting for a suitable donor organ, and that the situation is critical.
5. The fifth sentence raises the stakes by revealing that Robert's condition is so dire that he may not survive if he doesn't receive the transplant.
6. The sixth sentence creates a cliffhanger by stating that the organ is on its way, but that there is a risk of damage during transit.
7. The final sentence provides a resolution to the cliffhanger by stating that the transplant was successful, but the suspensefulness of the paragraph is already built up by the previous sentences, so it doesn't quite reach a 9 out of 9 on the suspensefulness scale.

Overall, the paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency through the use of vivid language and a clear conflict, but it doesn't quite reach the highest level of suspensefulness due to the relatively slow build-up of tension.
