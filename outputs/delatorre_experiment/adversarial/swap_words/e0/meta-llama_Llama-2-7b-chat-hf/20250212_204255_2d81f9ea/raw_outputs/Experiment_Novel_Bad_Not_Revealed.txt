  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The paragraph starts with a relatively straightforward statement of fact: "12 out the carry the to team medical 21:26, death of at organ Bent, to damage the been sustained able Finally, the having due liver transit without that the transplant Robert certified in." This doesn't create much suspense or intrigue.
2. The use of time-related language ("21:26,") and medical jargon ("organ Bent,") creates a sense of realism and authenticity, but doesn't contribute to the suspensefulness of the paragraph.
3. The mention of the patient's death and the damage sustained to their liver is somewhat ominous, but the language used is relatively neutral and doesn't create a strong sense of tension or suspense.
4. The mention of the transplant team certifying the transplant without the patient's liver is somewhat unexpected and could potentially create a sense of suspense, but the paragraph doesn't build on this in a meaningful way.

Overall, while the paragraph contains some elements that could potentially create suspense, it doesn't do much to actually build suspense or create a sense of tension. As a result, I would rate it as a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness.
