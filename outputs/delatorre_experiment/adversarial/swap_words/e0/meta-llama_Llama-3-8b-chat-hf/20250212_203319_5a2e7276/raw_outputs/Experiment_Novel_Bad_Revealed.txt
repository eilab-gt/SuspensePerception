I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph starts by setting a specific date and location, which creates a sense of realism and grounding. It then introduces the main character, Robert, and his critical medical situation, which raises the stakes and creates tension.

The paragraph builds suspense by describing the medical team's efforts to find a suitable donor and the uncertainty surrounding Robert's chances of survival. The use of phrases like "imminent entire a.m." and "not critical" creates a sense of urgency and raises the question of whether Robert will survive.

However, the paragraph's suspense is somewhat diminished by the lack of dramatic tension or surprises. The outcome of Robert's situation is fairly predictable, and the paragraph's focus on the medical details and procedures makes it feel more like a factual account than a suspenseful story.

Overall, while the paragraph is engaging and well-written, it could benefit from more dramatic tension and surprises to increase its suspensefulness.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is well-written and creates a sense of tension and urgency through its vivid descriptions and use of sensory details.

The opening sentence, "by men hair turning, heads down rotors from the still descended blades," is particularly effective in creating a sense of chaos and disorientation. The use of words like "whirlwind" and "blown fully" to describe the helicopter's blades creates a sense of intense energy and danger.

The use of phrases like "Realizing the doorway over the off" and "ducking case exit" creates a sense of urgency and danger, and the fact that the man is trying to get out of the helicopter adds to the sense of tension.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that it's a bit long and could be tightened up to create an even greater sense of suspense. Additionally, the outcome of the situation is still somewhat predictable, which could reduce the suspense. Overall, however, this paragraph is well-written and effectively builds suspense.
