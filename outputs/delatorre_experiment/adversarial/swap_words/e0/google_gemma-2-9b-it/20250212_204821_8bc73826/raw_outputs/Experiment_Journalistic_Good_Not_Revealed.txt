I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a critical liver transplant with a time constraint is inherently suspenseful. 
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is poorly written and lacks clear sentence structure, making it difficult to fully grasp the urgency and tension.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a strong sense of Robert's fear or the medical team's desperation.  
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds of beeping machines, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Show Robert's Internal Struggle:**  What are his thoughts and feelings as he waits?
* **Build Tension Through Pacing:**  Use shorter sentences and more active verbs to create a sense of urgency.
* **Hint at Potential Complications:**  Subtly suggest that the transplant might not be successful.
