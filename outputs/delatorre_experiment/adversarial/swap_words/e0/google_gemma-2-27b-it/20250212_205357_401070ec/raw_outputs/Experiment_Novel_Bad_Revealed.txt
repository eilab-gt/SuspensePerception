This paragraph scores a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Clear Narrative:** The paragraph is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative flow. It jumps between facts and details without building tension.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("were read," "were treating," "had been found") distances the reader from the action and reduces the sense of immediacy.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of Robert's fear, his family's anxiety, or the medical team's urgency. Without emotional investment, suspense is difficult to achieve.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Focus on a single, pivotal moment:** Instead of summarizing the entire event, zoom in on a specific moment of high tension, like the arrival of the organ or the moments before the transplant.
* **Use active voice and vivid language:**  Show the action unfolding, describe the characters' emotions, and create a sense of urgency through word choice.
* **Build anticipation:**  Hint at the potential dangers and the stakes involved. What could go wrong? What are the consequences of failure?

This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting and Action:** The paragraph describes a routine cleaning job in a hospital stairwell. There's nothing inherently suspenseful about this scenario.
* **Lack of Conflict or Threat:** There are no signs of danger, no looming threat, and no sense of urgency.
* **Passive Voice and Neutral Tone:** The writing is largely passive and lacks emotional engagement. The cleaner's thoughts and feelings are not explored, making it difficult for the reader to connect with the character or the situation.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual in the stairwell – a strange noise, a bloodstain, a hidden door.
* **Create a Sense of Isolation:** Emphasize the emptiness and silence of the stairwell, making the cleaner feel alone and vulnerable.
* **Build Tension Through Internal Monologue:** Let the reader into the cleaner's thoughts and feelings. Is he scared? Curious? Does he sense something is wrong?

This paragraph scores a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Introduction of Purpose:** The mention of a patient on the 6th floor and the urgency to get there quickly raises the stakes.
* **Dialogue Hints at Rules:** The colleague's comment about not taking the lift suggests there might be protocols or reasons for using the stairwell.

* **Add Foreshadowing:**  Include subtle hints about the nature of the patient's condition or the reason for the urgency.
* **Create Ambiguity:**  Leave the reader wondering why the lift is off-limits. Is it broken? Is there a security reason?

By building on the existing elements and adding layers of tension, this paragraph could become even more suspenseful.
