This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Clear Narrative:** The paragraph is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative flow. It jumps between facts and details without building tension.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("were read," "were treating," "had been found") distances the reader from the action and reduces emotional impact.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of Robert's fear, his family's anxiety, or the medical team's urgency.  

To increase suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **A Stronger Focus:**  Center the narrative on Robert's experience or the perspective of a specific character.
* **Active Voice:** Use active voice to create a more immediate and engaging feel.
* **Sensory Details:** Describe sights, sounds, and emotions to draw the reader into the scene.
* **Build-up:** Gradually increase the tension by hinting at the risks and uncertainties of the situation.

This paragraph scores a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Situation:** The image of a helicopter landing with a vital organ for a critically ill child is inherently suspenseful.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the full context, which piques curiosity.

However, it lacks:

* **Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the weight of the situation for Robert or those involved.
* **Sensory Details:**  Describing the sounds of the helicopter, the tension in the air, or Robert's condition would heighten the suspense.
* **Build-up:** The paragraph feels abrupt. Leading up to the arrival with more details about Robert's condition and the race against time would make it more gripping.

This paragraph scores a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Vivid Imagery:** The description of the helicopter landing, the spinning blades, and the whirlwind created a strong visual and sensory experience.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The mention of the critical patient and the time pressure adds to the tension.
* **Intriguing Details:** The focus on the liver being "compatible" and the men's actions create curiosity and anticipation.

However, it could be improved by:

* **Clearer Focus:**  While the scene is well-described, it's not entirely clear who the main character is or what their specific role is in the situation.
* **Emotional Depth:** Exploring the characters' feelings – fear, determination, hope – would make the scene more impactful.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph reveals information fairly quickly.  Slowing down the pace and hinting at potential obstacles or complications would heighten the suspense.

* **Lack of Conflict:** There are no immediate threats, challenges, or mysteries presented.

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual or hears a strange noise.
* **Create a Mystery:**  Hint at a hidden secret or a past event related to the stairwell.
* **Build Atmosphere:** Use sensory details to create a creepy or unsettling mood.
* **Raise the Stakes:** Give the cleaner a reason to be worried or afraid.
