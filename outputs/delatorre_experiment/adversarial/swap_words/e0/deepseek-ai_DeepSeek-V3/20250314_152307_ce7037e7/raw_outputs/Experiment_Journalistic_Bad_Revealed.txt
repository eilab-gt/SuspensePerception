I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The paragraph is very disjointed and difficult to follow. The lack of clear sentence structure and grammar makes it hard to understand the sequence of events, which diminishes any potential suspense.

2. **Emotional Engagement**: While the subject matter (a child awaiting a liver transplant) is inherently tense and emotional, the way it is presented here does not effectively build emotional investment or tension.

3. **Pacing and Build-Up**: There is no clear build-up or escalation of tension. The critical moments (e.g., the arrival of the organ, the uncertainty of survival) are mentioned abruptly without any detailed or immersive description.

4. **Resolution**: The paragraph ends abruptly with "This the story is what happened," which feels anticlimactic and does not provide a satisfying resolution or emotional payoff.

Overall, the potential for suspense is undermined by the poor execution of the narrative.
