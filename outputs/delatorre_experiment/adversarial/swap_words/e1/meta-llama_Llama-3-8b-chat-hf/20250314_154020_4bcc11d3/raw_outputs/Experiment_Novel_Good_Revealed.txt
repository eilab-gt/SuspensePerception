I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is primarily a factual account of a medical event, and it lacks the typical elements of suspense, such as tension, uncertainty, or a sense of danger. The language used is straightforward and objective, and the events described are presented in a matter-of-fact way. While the paragraph does mention that Robert's situation was critical and that he was awaiting a liver transplant, the tone is more informative than suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of intense action and urgency, with the helicopter landing on the roof of the hospital and the medical team rushing to get the patient to safety. The use of vivid imagery, such as the "whirlwind" and "rotors blades" spinning, helps to create a sense of chaos and danger. The fact that the patient is critically ill and that the team is racing against time to save him adds to the sense of tension and suspense.

The paragraph also does a good job of building suspense by creating uncertainty and raising questions in the reader's mind. For example, the reader is left wondering what will happen to the patient, whether the team will be able to save him, and what kind of challenges they will face in getting him to the operating room. The use of phrases like "Realizing he hadn't touched his watch" and "he heard the noise" also adds to the sense of tension and uncertainty.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that it is still a relatively straightforward and factual account of a medical emergency. While it is suspenseful, it is not particularly surprising or unexpected, and the reader is not left with a lot of unanswered questions or loose ends.
