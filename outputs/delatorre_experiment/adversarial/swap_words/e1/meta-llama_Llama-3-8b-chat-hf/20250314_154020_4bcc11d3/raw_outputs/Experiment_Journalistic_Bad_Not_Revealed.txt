I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The introduction of the protagonist, Robert, and the fact that he's in a critical situation creates some tension, but it's not particularly surprising or unexpected.
* The mention of a liver transplant and the urgency of the situation raises some questions, but the paragraph doesn't provide enough context or build-up to create a sense of real suspense.
* The final sentence, "However, they story what the of happened. is This", is somewhat cryptic and might pique the reader's curiosity, but it's not enough to create a strong sense of suspense.

Overall, the paragraph is more informative than suspenseful, and it doesn't have a strong narrative hook to draw the reader in.
