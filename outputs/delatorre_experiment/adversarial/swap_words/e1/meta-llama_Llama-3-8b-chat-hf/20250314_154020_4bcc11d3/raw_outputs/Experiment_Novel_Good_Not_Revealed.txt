I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of the main character, Robert, and his medical condition creates some tension and raises questions about his fate.
* The mention of the liver transplant and the wait for a donor organ creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The phrase "the wait were was his critical" is particularly suspenseful, as it implies that Robert's situation is dire and that time is running out.
* However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of tension or conflict, and the outcome is not entirely clear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert, but the paragraph does not provide enough information to create a strong sense of suspense.

Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be more effective if it created a stronger sense of tension and conflict, and if it provided more information to keep the reader guessing.
