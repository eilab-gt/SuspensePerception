I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific location and time, which creates a sense of realism and grounding.

* The mention of a critical situation and the uncertainty of the boy's survival creates a sense of urgency and concern.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more of a sense of mystery or unknown, rather than stating the situation outright.
* Built up the tension more gradually, rather than revealing the critical nature of the situation right away.
* Added more sensory details or vivid descriptions to create a more immersive experience for the reader.

Overall, the paragraph is engaging and suspenseful, but could benefit from a few tweaks to make it even more effective.
