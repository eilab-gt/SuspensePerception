* The mention of the liver transplant and the wait for a donor organ creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The phrase "the wait were was his critical" suggests that time is running out, which adds to the sense of tension.
* However, the paragraph does not have a clear sense of danger or threat, which is a key element of suspense. The reader is not given a sense of what might go wrong or what the consequences of failure might be.
* The final sentence, "This is happened. of the story what", is somewhat confusing and does not add to the suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some tension and raises questions about Robert's fate, it does not have a strong sense of suspense or danger, which is why I would rate it a 6 out of 9.
