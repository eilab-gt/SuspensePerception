This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Clear Narrative:** The paragraph is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative flow. It jumps between facts and details without building tension.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("were read," "were treating," "had been found") distances the reader from the action and reduces emotional impact.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of Robert's fear, his family's anxiety, or the medical team's urgency.  

To increase suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **A Stronger Focus:**  Center the narrative on Robert's experience or the perspective of a specific character.
* **Active Voice:** Use active voice to create a more immediate and engaging feel.
* **Sensory Details:** Describe sights, sounds, and emotions to draw the reader into the scene.
* **Build-up:** Gradually increase the tension by hinting at the risks and uncertainties of the situation.

This paragraph scores a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Situation:** The image of a helicopter landing with a vital organ for a critically ill child is inherently suspenseful.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the full context, which piques curiosity. What will happen next? Will the transplant be successful?

However, it lacks:

* **Emotional Depth:** We don't feel the weight of the situation or the characters' emotions.
* **Sensory Details:**  Describing the sounds of the helicopter, the tension in the air, or Robert's condition would heighten the suspense.
* **Build-up:** The paragraph feels abrupt. A lead-in sentence or two could create more anticipation.

This paragraph scores a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Action and Tension:** The scene is full of action – the helicopter landing, the spinning blades, the men rushing with the organ. This creates a sense of urgency and danger.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the whirlwind, the noise, and the temperature helps the reader feel immersed in the scene.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of the "critical situation" and the risk of losing the patient raises the stakes.

However, it could be improved by:

* **Clearer Focus:** The perspective shifts a bit abruptly. Sticking to one character's point of view would create a stronger connection.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the situation is critical, show it through the characters' actions and emotions.
* **Building Suspense:** The ending feels a bit rushed.  Adding a final sentence or two that leaves the reader wondering about the outcome would increase the suspense.

* **Mundane Setting:** The focus on a routine cleaning job in a hospital stairwell lacks inherent suspense.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There's no sense of danger, threat, or mystery. The cleaner's day seems ordinary.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was positioned," "were always," "was distributed") creates a detached and uneventful tone.

To increase suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **An Unexpected Event:** Introduce a sudden noise, a strange sight, or an encounter with a suspicious character.
* **Internal Conflict:** Give the cleaner a personal dilemma or a hidden fear that adds tension.
* **Foreshadowing:** Hint at something ominous lurking in the hospital, creating a sense of unease.

* **Shift in Tone:** The sudden appearance of the colleague and the mention of the 6th floor patient create a shift in focus and raise questions.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The colleague's insistence on taking the stairs instead of the lift suggests something is amiss.

However, it could be improved by:

* **Building Tension:**  Expand on the colleague's urgency. Why are they in such a hurry? What's the nature of the situation on the 6th floor?
* **Adding Sensory Details:** Describe the atmosphere of the stairwell – the dim lighting, the echoing footsteps, any unusual sounds.
* **Creating a Cliffhanger:** End the paragraph on a more suspenseful note. Perhaps the cleaner notices something strange as they descend the stairs.
