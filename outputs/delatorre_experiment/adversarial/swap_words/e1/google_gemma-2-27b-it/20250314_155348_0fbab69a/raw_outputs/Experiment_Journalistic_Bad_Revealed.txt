This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Disorganized:** The paragraph is poorly structured and grammatically incorrect, making it difficult to follow the narrative and build tension.
* **Lack of Focus:** The paragraph jumps between different pieces of information without establishing a clear sense of urgency or danger.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was found," "were treating," "had been certified") distances the reader from the action and reduces the emotional impact.

To increase suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **Clearer Structure:** A chronological order of events would help the reader understand the escalating situation.
* **Stronger Verbs:** Active voice and vivid verbs would create a more immediate and engaging experience.
* **Focus on Robert's Perspective:** Highlighting Robert's fear, hope, and vulnerability would make the reader more invested in his fate.

This paragraph scores a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intrigue:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ creates a sense of anticipation and hope.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of "punctually" with Robert's "critical condition" introduces a note of uncertainty and tension.
* **Brevity:** The short, declarative sentences create a sense of urgency and immediacy.

However, the paragraph lacks:

* **Context:** We don't know enough about Robert's situation or the stakes involved to feel truly invested.
* **Emotional Depth:** There's no exploration of Robert's feelings or the medical team's anxiety.
* **Resolution:** The paragraph ends abruptly, leaving the reader hanging.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Expand on Robert's condition:** Describe his symptoms, his family's reaction, or the doctors' concerns.

This paragraph scores a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Mystery:** The paragraph raises questions about the men's identities, their purpose, and the significance of the liver.
* **Implied Importance:** The phrase "fully functioning liver" suggests a sense of urgency and the preciousness of the cargo.

This paragraph scores a **3** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Potential Danger:** The "wet floor" sign and the mention of a recently mopped stairwell suggest a potential hazard, creating a slight sense of unease.
* **Implied Negligence:** The fact that the cleaner left without displaying the sign earlier hints at carelessness, raising the stakes slightly.

However, the paragraph lacks:

* **Context:** We don't know who might be in danger or what the consequences of a fall could be.
* **Sensory Details:** The description is very bare-bones. Adding details about the slippery surface, the echoing emptiness of the stairwell, or the sound of approaching footsteps could heighten the tension.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Introduce a character:** Show someone approaching the stairwell, unaware of the wet floor.
