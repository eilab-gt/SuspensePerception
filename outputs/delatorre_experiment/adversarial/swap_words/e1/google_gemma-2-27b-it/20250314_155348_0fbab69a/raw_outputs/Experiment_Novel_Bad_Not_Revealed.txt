I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Jumbled Structure:** The paragraph is grammatically awkward and disjointed, making it hard to follow the narrative flow. This hinders the build-up of suspense.
* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While we know Robert is critically ill and needs a transplant, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state the immediate danger he's in. 
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("were ready," "had been awaiting") distances the reader from the action and reduces tension.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Rewrite for clarity and flow:**  Organize the sentences in a logical order and use active voice.
* **Highlight the stakes:** Emphasize the urgency of Robert's situation and the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen.
* **Create anticipation:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles that could arise.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intrigue:** The paragraph introduces a sense of urgency with the mention of a "critical" organ and a helicopter landing. This piques the reader's curiosity about what's happening.
* **Limited Information:** The lack of context and detail leaves the reader with questions. Who is Robert Bent? What organ is being transported? This ambiguity can create suspense.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The paragraph ends abruptly, leaving the reader hanging. This can be effective in building suspense, as it leaves them wanting to know what happens next.

**However:**

* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** The paragraph is very factual and lacks emotional depth. We don't get a sense of Robert's fear or the tension surrounding the situation.
* **Choppy Sentence Structure:** The short, fragmented sentences contribute to a sense of urgency but also make the writing feel a bit disjointed.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the atmosphere in the hospital, Robert's physical state.
* **Develop Robert's character:** Give the reader a glimpse into his thoughts and feelings.
* **Create a sense of impending doom:** Hint at potential complications or obstacles that could arise.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Vivid Imagery:** The description of the helicopter landing, the spinning rotors, and the men battling the wind creates a strong visual and sensory experience, drawing the reader into the scene.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The mention of a "critical situation" and the need to "lose no time" emphasizes the high stakes involved.
* **Intriguing Details:** The focus on the liver, the temperature, and the compatibility adds a layer of mystery and raises questions about the patient's condition.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Clarity:** The paragraph is a bit convoluted and could benefit from clearer sentence structure and organization.
* **Emotional Connection:** While the scene is visually engaging, it lacks emotional depth. We don't get a strong sense of the characters' fear or anxiety.
* **Pacing:** The paragraph feels a bit rushed. Slowing down the pace and focusing on specific moments could heighten the suspense.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the situation is critical, show the characters' reactions and the challenges they face.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The paragraph focuses on the routine tasks of a hospital cleaner, which is not inherently suspenseful.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There's no sense of danger, threat, or mystery. The cleaner's day seems ordinary and uneventful.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("had finished," "was positioned," "were always") creates a detached and unemotional tone.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:** Add an element of danger or uncertainty to the cleaner's routine. Perhaps he discovers something unusual, hears a strange noise, or encounters a suspicious person.
* **Create a Sense of Foreboding:** Use descriptive language to hint at something sinister lurking beneath the surface of the ordinary.
* **Focus on the Character's Emotions:** Show the cleaner's reactions to the events unfolding around him. Does he feel fear, curiosity, or unease?
