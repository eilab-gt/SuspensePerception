I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes a high-stakes situation:** A child needing a liver transplant is inherently suspenseful.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The phrase "all day" and the mention of the organ arriving "imminent" create a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential danger:** The line "However, they were not sure if he would survive" adds a layer of uncertainty and fear.

**However:**

* **The writing is clunky and grammatically incorrect:** This detracts from the overall impact and makes it harder to get fully invested in the suspense.
* **It lacks vivid imagery or emotional depth:** We don't get a strong sense of Robert's character or the emotional toll this situation is taking on him or his family.


With some revisions for clarity and emotional resonance, this paragraph could be much more suspenseful.

Here's why:

* **It continues the established high stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and needs the organ.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **The introduction of the "blue men" is unexpected and intriguing:** This immediately piques the reader's curiosity and adds an element of the surreal or mysterious.
* **The image of them descending from the helicopter with the liver is visually striking:** It creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* **The detail about the liver being "fully functioning" adds to the stakes:** We understand that this is a precious and vital organ.

**However:**

* **The paragraph is still quite short and lacks context:** We don't know who these men are or why they are blue.

Overall, this paragraph has the potential to be quite suspenseful, but it needs further development to fully realize its potential.

Here's why:

* **It builds on the previous scene:** We know the liver is crucial, and the men's decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator adds a layer of intrigue.

However:

* **The writing is still quite basic:** It lacks vivid descriptions or emotional depth.
* **The reason for their choice is unclear:**  We don't know why they're avoiding the elevator, which leaves the suspense somewhat ambiguous.

This paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation but needs more development to truly hook the reader.

This paragraph is a good example of a cliffhanger, but it needs to be followed up with more detail and emotional depth to fully realize its suspenseful potential.
