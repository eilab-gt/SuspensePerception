I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Jumbled Structure:** The paragraph is grammatically awkward and disjointed, making it hard to follow the narrative flow. This hinders the build-up of suspense.
* **Lack of Vivid Detail:** The writing lacks sensory details and emotional engagement. We don't feel the urgency of the situation or connect with Robert's plight.
* **Delayed Information:** While the paragraph hints at a critical situation, it doesn't reveal enough information to truly hook the reader. We know a transplant is imminent, but the stakes aren't clearly defined.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Rewrite for clarity and flow:**  Organize the sentences logically and use proper grammar.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's condition, and the emotions of those involved.
* **Raise the stakes:** Highlight the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen.
* **Create a cliffhanger:** End the paragraph with a question or a moment of uncertainty to leave the reader wanting more.
