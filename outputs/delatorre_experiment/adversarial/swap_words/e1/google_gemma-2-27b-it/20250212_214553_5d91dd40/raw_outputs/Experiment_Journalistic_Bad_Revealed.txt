* **Lack of Focus:** The paragraph jumps around chronologically and introduces information in a confusing way. We don't get a clear sense of the immediate danger Robert is in.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** There's no attempt to connect the reader emotionally to Robert's situation. We don't know anything about him as a person, making it harder to care about his fate.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Clear Timeline:** Establish a clear chronological order of events.
* **Focus on Robert:**  Describe his condition, his feelings, and the fear he might be experiencing.
* **Build Tension:** Use descriptive language to create a sense of urgency and impending danger.

This paragraph scores a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intrigue:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ creates a sense of anticipation and hope.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of "punctually" with Robert's "critical condition" hints at the precariousness of the situation.
* **Brevity:** The short, declarative sentences add to the tension by withholding information and leaving the reader wanting more.

**However:**

* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know how critical Robert's condition is, what might happen next, or how the transplant will proceed.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("was landed") makes the writing feel less immediate and engaging.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his symptoms or the reactions of the medical team.
* **Sensory Details:** Use vivid language to create a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Internal Monologue:** Give the reader access to Bent's thoughts and feelings as he waits for the transplant to take place.

This paragraph scores a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Visual Imagery:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter with a "small blue case" containing the liver creates a strong visual image and piques curiosity.
* **Mystery:** The paragraph leaves us wondering about the men's identities, their roles in the transplant, and the significance of the "fully functioning" liver.
* **Implied Importance:** The emphasis on the liver being "fully functioning" suggests its crucial role in Robert's survival, adding to the tension.

**However:**

* **Lack of Context:** We still don't know what's happening to Robert or how the arrival of the liver will affect him.
* **Limited Emotional Connection:** We don't feel any emotional connection to the characters or the situation.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Connect to Robert:** Show how Robert's condition is worsening while the men are transporting the liver.

* **Heighten the Stakes:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation and the potential consequences of failure.
