This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale.

* **Lack of Clear Narrative:** The paragraph is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative flow. It jumps between facts and details without building tension.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("were read," "were treating," "had been found") distances the reader from the action and reduces emotional impact.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of Robert's fear, his family's anxiety, or the medical team's urgency.  

To increase suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **A Stronger Focus:**  Center the narrative on Robert's experience or the perspective of a specific character.
* **Active Voice:** Use active voice to create a more immediate and engaging feel.
* **Sensory Details:** Describe sights, sounds, and emotions to draw the reader into the scene.
