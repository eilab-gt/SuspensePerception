I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph appears to be a factual account of a medical event, and while it describes a critical situation, it does so in a dry and matter-of-fact way. The use of phrases like "What happened" and "This story is" also detract from any sense of suspense, as they suggest a more informative or explanatory tone rather than a suspenseful one. Additionally, the paragraph jumps around in time and includes unnecessary details, which disrupts the flow and makes it harder to build tension. Overall, the paragraph lacks the key elements of suspense, such as foreshadowing, cliffhangers, or a sense of urgency, which makes it feel more like a factual report than a suspenseful narrative.
