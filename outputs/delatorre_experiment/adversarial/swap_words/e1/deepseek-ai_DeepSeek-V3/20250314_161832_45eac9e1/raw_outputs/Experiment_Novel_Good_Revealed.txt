This paragraph is difficult to follow due to its disjointed structure and lack of clarity. The suspense is minimal because the narrative is confusing and hard to engage with. I would rate it a **2** for suspensefulness. The potential for suspense is there (e.g., a critical liver transplant), but the execution makes it hard to feel invested or anxious about the outcome.
