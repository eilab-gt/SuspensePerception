I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Lack of Clarity**: The paragraph is disjointed and difficult to follow, which detracts from any potential suspense. The sentences are fragmented and lack coherence, making it hard to understand the situation fully.

2. **Emotional Engagement**: While the topic of a liver transplant for a young boy could be inherently suspenseful, the writing fails to evoke any emotional connection or tension. The stakes are mentioned (Robert's survival is uncertain), but they are not developed in a way that builds suspense.

3. **Pacing**: The paragraph does not build tension effectively. It jumps between details without creating a sense of urgency or anticipation. The mention of the donor organ being found is buried in the text and not highlighted as a pivotal moment.

4. **Resolution**: The paragraph ends abruptly without resolving the situation or leaving the reader hanging in a way that would create suspense. It simply states, "This story of is happened," which is confusing and unsatisfying.

Overall, while the subject matter has potential for suspense, the execution of the paragraph does not effectively create or maintain tension.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Potential for Suspense**: The idea of a helicopter carrying a critical organ landing on a hospital roof has inherent suspense. The urgency of the situation and the life-or-death stakes could be compelling.
