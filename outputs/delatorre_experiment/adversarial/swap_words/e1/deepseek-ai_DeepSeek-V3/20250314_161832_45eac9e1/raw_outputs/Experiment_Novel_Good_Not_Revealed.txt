I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. While the situation described—a young boy awaiting a liver transplant—is inherently tense and critical, the paragraph is poorly structured and difficult to follow. The lack of clarity and coherence diminishes the potential suspense. Additionally, there is no buildup or emotional engagement to heighten the tension. A more focused and well-written narrative could significantly increase the suspense.
