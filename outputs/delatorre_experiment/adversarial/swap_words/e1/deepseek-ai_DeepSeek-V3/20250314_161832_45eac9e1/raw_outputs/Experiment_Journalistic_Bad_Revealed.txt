I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. The paragraph contains elements that could be suspenseful, such as a critical medical situation and the uncertainty of a liver transplant. However, the writing is disjointed, unclear, and lacks a coherent narrative structure, which significantly diminishes the suspense. The lack of flow and clarity makes it difficult for the reader to become emotionally invested or feel the tension of the situation.

While the paragraph hints at a tense situation—a helicopter carrying an organ landing for a critical patient—the writing is fragmented and lacks detail or emotional depth.

The fragmented writing style also slightly detracts from the overall impact.
