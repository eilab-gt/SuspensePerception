I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a critical liver transplant with a time constraint immediately grabs attention. 
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is poorly written and lacks clear sentence structure, making it difficult to fully grasp the urgency and tension.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a strong sense of Robert's fear or the medical team's desperation.  
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds of beeping machines, the anxious faces of the medical staff.
* **Use Active Voice:**  Instead of "they were treating him," write "doctors fought to stabilize him."
* **Build Tension Through Pacing:**  Short, choppy sentences can create a sense of urgency.
* **Show Robert's Perspective:**  Give us glimpses into his thoughts and feelings as he awaits the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Image:** The image of men in blue carrying a functioning liver in a case is immediately eye-catching and raises questions.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very brief and doesn't give us much to work with. We don't know who the men are, why they're transporting the liver, or what the stakes are.

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying they "decided to walk," describe their movements – their hurried steps, their glances over their shoulders.
