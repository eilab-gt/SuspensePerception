I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While the paragraph mentions a critical situation and the need for a liver transplant, it doesn't establish a clear and present danger. We don't know what specific threats Robert faces or what might go wrong.
* **Passive Voice and Jumbled Sentences:** The writing style is choppy and relies heavily on passive voice, which makes it harder to feel invested in the situation.  
* **Telling Instead of Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on a specific threat:**  Instead of just saying Robert is critical, describe the symptoms or the potential consequences of not getting a transplant.
* **Use active voice and shorter sentences:** This will create a more urgent and engaging tone.
* **Show, don't tell:**  Describe Robert's fear, the tension in the hospital, or the doctors' worried expressions.
* **Build anticipation:**  Hint at possible complications or delays in the transplant process.

Here's why:

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict or Threat:** The paragraph describes a mundane and routine job. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or uncertainty.
* **Passive Voice and Descriptive Language:** The writing style is very passive and focuses on describing the environment and the cleaner's tasks rather than creating a sense of tension.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce an unexpected event:**  Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, hears a strange noise, or encounters a suspicious person.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Shift in Setting:** The paragraph moves from the mundane stairwell to a more intriguing location â€“ the helipad and service corridors. This change in setting creates a slight sense of mystery.

**However, the paragraph lacks:**

* **Heightened Stakes:** We don't know what's so important about the patient or the case that it warrants such urgency.
* **Sensory Details:** The writing is mostly descriptive and lacks vivid sensory details that could create a more immersive and suspenseful experience.
* **Internal Conflict:** We don't get a sense of the characters' thoughts or feelings, which could add another layer of suspense.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Reveal more about the patient's condition:** Is it life-threatening? Is there a time limit for treatment?
* **Introduce a potential obstacle:**  Perhaps there's a security checkpoint, a malfunctioning lift, or a sudden change in plans.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Tension:** The paragraph states a fact (the transplant was successful) without building any suspense or anticipation.
