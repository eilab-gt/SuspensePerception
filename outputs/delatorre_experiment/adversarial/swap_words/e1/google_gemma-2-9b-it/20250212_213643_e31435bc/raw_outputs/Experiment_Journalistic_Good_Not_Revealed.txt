I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a child needing a liver transplant and the urgency of the situation creates a natural hook.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is poorly written and lacks clear sentence structure, making it difficult to fully grasp the situation and the stakes. 
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** While we know Robert is in a critical situation, we don't feel his fear or the desperation of his family.  
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's physical state, the anxious atmosphere.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying Robert's situation is critical, describe his labored breathing, the beeping of machines, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Build Tension:**  Hint at potential complications, delays, or doubts about the transplant's success.
* **Create a Cliffhanger:** End the paragraph on a note that leaves the reader wanting to know what happens next.
