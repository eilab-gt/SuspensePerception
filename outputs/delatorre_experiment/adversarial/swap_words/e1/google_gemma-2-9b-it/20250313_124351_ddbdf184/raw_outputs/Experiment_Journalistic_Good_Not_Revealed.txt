I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a critical liver transplant with a time constraint immediately grabs attention. 
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is poorly written and lacks clear sentence structure, making it difficult to fully grasp the urgency and tension.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a strong sense of Robert's fear or the medical team's desperation.  
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds of beeping machines, the anxious faces of the medical staff.
* **Use Active Voice:**  Instead of "they were treating him," write "doctors fought to stabilize him."
* **Build Tension Through Pacing:**  Short, choppy sentences can create a sense of urgency.
* **Show Robert's Perspective:**  Give us glimpses into his thoughts and feelings as he awaits the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Abrupt and Disjointed:** The sentences are fragmented and lack a clear flow, making it hard to follow the action.
* **Missing Context:** We don't know enough about Robert's condition or the significance of the organ to feel invested in the outcome.
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** The paragraph is purely factual and doesn't evoke any feelings of fear, hope, or anticipation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Establish a Clear Narrative:**  Start with a sentence that sets the scene and introduces the stakes. For example: "The helicopter blades whipped the air, a frantic counterpoint to the pounding in Robert Bent's chest."
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying Robert was in critical condition, describe his labored breathing, the pallor of his skin, or the worried faces of the medical team.
* **Build Tension Through Detail:** Focus on sensory details that heighten the urgency. Describe the roar of the helicopter, the flashing lights of the ambulance, the hushed whispers in the hospital corridor.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Image:** The image of men in blue carrying a functioning liver in a case is immediately attention-grabbing and creates a sense of mystery.
* **Lack of Context:** We still don't know enough about the situation. Who are these men? Why are they dressed in blue? What's the significance of the liver?
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("which was stored") weakens the impact and slows down the pacing.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Add Sensory Details:** Describe the smell of antiseptic in the air, the whirring of the helicopter blades, the hurried footsteps of the men.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** Use shorter sentences and active verbs to convey the importance of the situation. For example, instead of "the liver was stored," write "the precious organ was carefully secured."
* **Hint at Danger:**  Subtly suggest that something could go wrong. Perhaps the men are being followed, or there's a time limit on the transplant.
