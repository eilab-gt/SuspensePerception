As the helicopter descended, the two men on the roof of the hospital could barely hear each other over the roar of the rotors and the whirlwind of air they created. They clutched the case containing the precious liver, keeping it at a steady four degrees centigrade. Suddenly, one of them realized that his wristwatch had been touched by the spinning blades and he quickly moved it away, narrowly avoiding disaster. The helicopter took off again, leaving them in its dust as they hurried towards the doorway with the critical patient waiting inside. They knew that every second counted and that they couldn't afford to lose a moment in this life-or-death situation.

He quickly gathered his mop and bucket and stepped aside to let the men pass. As they hurried past, he caught a glimpse of something shiny and metallic in one of their hands. It looked like a gun. The cleaner's heart raced as he realized that he was in the middle of a dangerous situation. He had to think fast and find a way to get out of there before it was too late.
