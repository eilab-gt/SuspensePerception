Despite the pain, he tried to move as quickly as he could, knowing that every second counted. Suddenly, he heard the sound of rushing footsteps in the stairwell. Three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. 'Move aside, please,' one of them said, kneeling down next to the case.

The small syringe was guided to the left lobe of the liver, and the surgeon felt his hands trembling as he made the incision. He knew that one wrong move could damage the organ irreparably.

The minutes ticked by as they awaited the diagnosis, their concern growing with each passing moment. Finally, the surgeon lifted his head and looked at the microscope, his fears confirmed.
