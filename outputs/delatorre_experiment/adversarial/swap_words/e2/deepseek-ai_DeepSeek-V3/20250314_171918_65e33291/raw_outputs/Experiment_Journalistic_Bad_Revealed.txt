I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. While the subject matter (a liver transplant for a young boy) is inherently tense and dramatic, the paragraph is poorly structured, repetitive, and lacks clarity. The disjointed sentences and lack of focus make it difficult to follow the narrative or feel the urgency of the situation. A more coherent and engaging writing style would significantly increase the suspense.
