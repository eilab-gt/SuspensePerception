I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The phrase "the wait were was his critical" is particularly suspenseful, as it implies that Robert's situation is dire and that time is running out.
* However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of tension or conflict, and the outcome is not entirely clear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert, but the paragraph does not provide enough information to create a strong sense of suspense.
