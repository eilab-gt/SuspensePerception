I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. This paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous one because it creates a sense of urgency and tension. The use of the word "critical" to describe Robert's condition implies that his situation is serious and potentially life-threatening. The fact that he is being transported by helicopter to the hospital also adds to the sense of urgency and danger.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. This paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous ones because it introduces a new and unexpected element: the "blue men" who are carrying the liver.

The phrase "descended from helicopter" adds to the sense of urgency and drama, and the fact that they are carrying a "functioning" liver implies that it may be used for a transplant. The paragraph raises more questions than it answers, such as who the blue men are, what their purpose is, and what will happen next, which creates a sense of tension and suspense.
