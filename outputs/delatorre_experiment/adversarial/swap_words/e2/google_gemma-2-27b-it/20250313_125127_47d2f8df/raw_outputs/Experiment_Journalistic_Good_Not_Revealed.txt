I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes a high-stakes situation:** A child needing a liver transplant is inherently suspenseful.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The phrase "all day" and the mention of the organ arriving "imminent" create a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential danger:** The line "However, they were not sure if he would survive" adds a layer of uncertainty and fear.

**However:**

* **The writing is clunky and grammatically incorrect:** This detracts from the overall impact and makes it harder to get fully invested in the suspense.
* **It lacks vivid imagery or emotional depth:** We don't get a strong sense of Robert's character or the emotional toll this situation is taking on him or his family.


With some polishing and more evocative language, this paragraph could be much more suspenseful.
