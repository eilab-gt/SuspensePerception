I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Jumbled Structure:** The paragraph is grammatically awkward and disjointed, making it hard to follow the narrative flow. This hinders the build-up of suspense.
* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While we know Robert is critically ill and needs a transplant, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state the immediate danger he's in. 
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("were ready," "had been awaiting") distances the reader from the action and reduces tension.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Rewrite for clarity:**  Use proper grammar and sentence structure to create a smoother, more engaging narrative.
* **Highlight the stakes:** Emphasize the urgency of Robert's situation and the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen.
* **Use active voice:**  Make the writing more dynamic and immediate by using active verbs.
* **Build anticipation:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles that could arise during the transplant process.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intrigue:** The paragraph introduces a sense of urgency with the mention of a "critical" organ and a helicopter landing. This piques the reader's curiosity about what's happening.
* **Lack of Context:** The lack of background information and character development makes it harder to fully connect with the situation and feel the suspense.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The paragraph ends rather abruptly, leaving the reader hanging and wanting to know more about Robert's condition and the outcome of the transplant.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Provide more context:** Briefly describe Robert's condition and the importance of the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Vivid Imagery:** The description of the helicopter landing, the spinning rotors, and the men battling the wind creates a strong visual and sensory experience, drawing the reader into the scene.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The mention of a "critical situation" and the need to "lose no time" establishes a clear sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* **Unclear Threat:** While the paragraph hints at danger, it doesn't explicitly state what the threat is. This ambiguity can be intriguing but also slightly frustrating for the reader.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't know much about the characters or their motivations, which makes it harder to fully invest in their plight.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Focus on a single character's perspective:** This would allow for deeper emotional engagement and internal conflict.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  What are the specific consequences if they fail to deliver the liver on time?
* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Give a specific timeframe for the delivery, adding to the pressure.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the situation is critical, describe the physical and emotional toll it takes on the characters.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The paragraph focuses on the routine tasks of a hospital cleaner, which lacks inherent suspense.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There's no sense of danger, threat, or mystery. The cleaner's day seems ordinary and predictable.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("had finished," "were positioned," "was always dull") creates a detached and uneventful tone.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual while mopping, like a hidden message or a suspicious object.
* **Create a Sense of Mystery:** Hint at a secret or a hidden danger within the hospital.
* **Focus on the Cleaner's Perspective:** Explore his thoughts and feelings as he encounters something unsettling.
