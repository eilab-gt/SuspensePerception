I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes a high-stakes situation:** A child needing a liver transplant is inherently suspenseful.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The phrase "all day" and the mention of the organ arriving "imminent" create a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential danger:** The line "However, not wait if happened" suggests something could go wrong.

**However:**

* **The writing is clunky and grammatically incorrect:** This makes it harder to get fully immersed in the suspense.
* **The paragraph lacks vivid details:** We don't get a strong sense of the characters' emotions or the atmosphere of the hospital.

With some polishing and more descriptive language, this paragraph could be much more suspenseful.
