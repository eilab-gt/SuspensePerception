I would rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Confusing Structure:** The paragraph is poorly structured and grammatically incorrect, making it difficult to follow the narrative and build tension.
* **Lack of Vivid Detail:** The writing lacks sensory details and emotional depth. We don't feel the urgency of the situation or connect with Robert's plight.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("were called," "were ready," "had been found") weakens the impact and makes the writing feel distant.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Rewrite for clarity and flow.**
* **Use strong verbs and active voice.**
* **Add sensory details to immerse the reader in the scene.**
* **Focus on Robert's emotions and the stakes involved.**
