  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a clear conflict or problem (Robert's critical condition and the need for a liver transplant) and creates a sense of urgency by mentioning that the donor liver is on its way and the team is waiting for its arrival. The use of phrases like "not wait his critical" and "would sure survive if" adds to the tension and raises the stakes for the character.

However, the paragraph also lacks some key elements of suspense. For example, there is no clear indication of what might go wrong or how the situation might escalate. The paragraph simply states that the donor liver has been found and is on its way, without providing any details about the potential obstacles or complications that might arise.

Overall, while the paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency, it could benefit from more specific details and plot developments to make it even more suspenseful.
