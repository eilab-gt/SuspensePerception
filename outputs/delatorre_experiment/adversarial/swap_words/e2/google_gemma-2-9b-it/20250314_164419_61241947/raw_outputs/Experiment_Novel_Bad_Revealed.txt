I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Disorganized and Unclear:** The paragraph is poorly structured and difficult to follow. The jumbled sentence fragments make it hard to grasp the narrative and the stakes involved.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:**  We don't get a sense of Robert's personality, his fears, or the emotional weight of the situation. Without an emotional connection to the character, it's hard to feel suspense.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert is in a critical situation and awaiting a transplant, but it doesn't show us the tension or urgency through vivid descriptions or actions.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **Clear and Engaging Structure:**  Organize the sentences into a logical flow that builds towards a climax.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Use descriptive language and sensory details to immerse the reader in the scene and create a sense of immediacy.
* **Develop Character:** Give us glimpses into Robert's thoughts, feelings, and reactions to his situation.
* **Raise the Stakes:** Highlight the potential consequences of failure and create a sense of danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Hints of Urgency:** The words "critical condition" and "punctually" suggest a time-sensitive situation. The arrival of the helicopter adds a sense of drama and potential danger.
* **Lack of Detail:**  We don't know enough about Robert's condition or the nature of the organ transplant to feel truly invested in the outcome. 
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("was landed") makes the action feel less immediate and impactful.

To increase the suspense, consider:

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert is in critical condition, describe his physical state or the frantic efforts of the medical team.
* **Sensory Details:**  Use vivid language to describe the whirring of the helicopter blades, the tense atmosphere in the hospital, or Robert's labored breathing.
* **Internal Monologue:**  Give us a glimpse into Robert's thoughts and fears as he awaits the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Action and Tension:** The paragraph is packed with action verbs and descriptions of movement (descending, spinning, clutching, shouting, ducking, moving) which create a sense of urgency and tension.
* **Sensory Details:**  The use of sensory details like "whirlwind," "spinning blades," and "blue temperature" helps to immerse the reader in the scene.
* **Unclear Stakes:** While we understand the situation is critical, the paragraph doesn't clearly articulate the potential consequences of failure. What happens if they lose the patient? What are the risks associated with the transplant?
* **Jumbled Structure:** The sentence structure is somewhat convoluted, making it slightly difficult to follow the sequence of events.

To increase the suspense further:

* **Focus on the Stakes:**  Emphasize the potential consequences of failure.  Describe the patient's deteriorating condition or the risks associated with the transplant.
* **Heighten the Emotional Impact:**  Give us a glimpse into the characters' emotions – their fear, determination, or desperation.
* **Refine the Structure:**  Break down the long sentences into shorter, more impactful ones.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict or Tension:** The paragraph describes a mundane, everyday task – cleaning a hospital stairwell. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or uncertainty.
* **Passive Voice and Telling:** The writing relies heavily on passive voice and telling rather than showing. We're told the job is "agreeable" and "not particularly interesting," but we don't experience it through vivid descriptions or engaging action.
* **No Stakes:** There are no clear stakes or consequences for the cleaner's actions. We don't know what might happen if he doesn't finish his job or if something unexpected occurs.

To make this paragraph more suspenseful, you would need to introduce:

* **A Compelling Conflict:** Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual while cleaning, or a patient needs urgent assistance.
* **Rising Tension:**  Build suspense by gradually increasing the sense of urgency or danger.
* **Unreliable Narrator:**  Consider having the cleaner's perception of the situation be skewed or unreliable, creating a sense of unease.
* **Sensory Details:** Use vivid language to describe the environment and create a more immersive experience.

* **Heighten the Stakes:**  What are the consequences if they don't reach the patient in time? What is the nature of the patient's condition?

* **Sensory Details:** Use vivid language to describe the sounds, smells, and atmosphere of the hospital corridors.
