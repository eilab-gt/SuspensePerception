I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Disorganized and unclear:** The paragraph is grammatically jumbled and lacks a clear narrative flow. This makes it difficult to grasp the situation and build suspense.
* **Missing emotional connection:**  While the topic of a life-or-death organ transplant is inherently suspenseful, the paragraph fails to connect us emotionally to Robert or the medical team. We don't feel their urgency or fear.
* **Telling instead of showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert is in a critical situation and the team is waiting for a donor, but it doesn't show us the tension or the struggle.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Be rewritten with clear and concise language.**
* **Focus on sensory details and emotional reactions.**
* **Use shorter sentences and build towards a climax.**
* **Create a sense of urgency and impending danger.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing imagery:** The image of men descending from a helicopter carrying a functioning liver in a small, blue case is immediately attention-grabbing. 
* **Mystery:** We don't know who these men are, why they're so secretive, or what the implications of this liver are. This lack of information creates a sense of intrigue and suspense.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of context:** We have no idea why a wet floor sign in a stairwell is suspenseful.  What's at stake? Is someone in danger?
* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("the floor had been mopped") makes the action feel distant and uneventful.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Establish a sense of danger:**  Perhaps someone is rushing down the stairs, or there's a threat lurking in the shadows.
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  Is there a time limit? Is someone in danger of slipping and falling?
* **Use active voice and strong verbs:**  Instead of "the floor had been mopped," try "The cleaner furiously mopped the floor, leaving a trail of glistening water."
* **End with a cliffhanger:**  What happens next? Does someone slip? Does someone appear from the darkness?

Here's why:
