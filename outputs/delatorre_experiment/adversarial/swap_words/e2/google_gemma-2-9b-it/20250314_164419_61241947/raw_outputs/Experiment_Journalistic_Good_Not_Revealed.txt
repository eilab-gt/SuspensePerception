I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a critical liver transplant with a time constraint immediately grabs attention. 
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is poorly written and lacks clear sentence structure, making it difficult to fully grasp the urgency and tension.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:**  We don't get a strong sense of Robert's fear or the medical team's desperation.  
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds of beeping machines, the anxious faces of the medical staff.
* **Show Robert's Perspective:**  What is he thinking and feeling? Is he scared? Hopeful?
* **Build Tension Through Action:**  Describe the frantic search for a donor, the race against time, the moments of doubt and uncertainty.
* **Use Strong Verbs and Adjectives:**  Replace passive language with active verbs and evocative adjectives to create a more visceral experience.
