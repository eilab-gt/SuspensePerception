I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a critical liver transplant with a time-sensitive situation immediately grabs attention. 
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is poorly written and lacks clear sentence structure, making it difficult to fully grasp the urgency and tension.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:**  We don't get a strong sense of Robert's fear or the team's desperation.  
* **Abrupt Ending:** The final sentence, "This is the story of what happened," feels anticlimactic and doesn't leave the reader wanting more.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's physical state, the team's anxious energy.
* **Build Tension:** Use shorter sentences, active voice, and words that convey urgency (e.g., "racing," "frantic," "precarious").
* **Create a Cliffhanger:** End the paragraph on a note that leaves the reader wondering what will happen next.
