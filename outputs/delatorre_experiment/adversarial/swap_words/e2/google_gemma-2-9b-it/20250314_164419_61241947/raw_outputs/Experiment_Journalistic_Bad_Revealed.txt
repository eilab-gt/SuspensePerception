I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Disorganized and unclear:** The paragraph is poorly structured and difficult to follow. The jumbled sentence fragments make it hard to grasp the narrative and the stakes involved.
* **Lack of tension:**  While the situation described (an eight-year-old boy needing a liver transplant) is inherently serious, the paragraph doesn't build any real tension or anticipation.  
* **Missing emotional connection:** We don't get a sense of Robert's fear, hope, or the emotional weight of the situation for his family.

To make this paragraph more suspenseful, it needs:

* **Clear and concise writing:**  Restructure the sentences to create a logical flow and make the story easier to understand.
* **Focus on the ticking clock:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation by highlighting the limited time Robert has before the organ arrives.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating facts, use descriptive language to paint a picture of the hospital environment and Robert's emotional state.
* **Build anticipation:**  Hint at potential complications or setbacks to keep the reader guessing about the outcome.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing setup:** The paragraph starts with a sense of urgency ("punctually" and "critical condition") and introduces a dramatic element (helicopter landing on the roof).
* **Lack of detail:**  We don't know enough about the situation to feel truly invested.  What kind of organ is it?  What are the risks involved in the transplant?  How is Robert feeling?
* **Abrupt ending:** The paragraph ends rather abruptly, leaving the reader hanging. What happens next?  Is the transplant successful?

To make this paragraph more suspenseful, consider:

* **Expanding on the details:** Describe the helicopter's arrival, the medical team's actions, and Robert's reaction.
* **Heightening the stakes:**  Hint at potential complications or dangers associated with the transplant.
* **Creating a cliffhanger:** End the paragraph on a question or a moment of uncertainty that leaves the reader wanting more.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The image of two men carrying a functioning liver in a small blue case from a helicopter is inherently intriguing. It suggests a high-stakes situation.
* **Lack of context:** We don't know who these men are, where they're going, or why the liver is so important. This lack of context makes it hard to feel invested in the outcome.
* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("was descended") makes the action feel distant and less impactful.

To make this paragraph more suspenseful, consider:

* **Adding character details:** Give the men names and brief descriptions to make them more relatable.
* **Establishing a sense of urgency:**  Hint at the time pressure involved in transporting the liver.
* **Creating a sense of mystery:**  Why is the liver being transported in such a secretive way? Who is it for?
* **Using active voice:**  Replace passive constructions with active verbs to create a more dynamic and engaging read.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of context:** We don't know why the wet floor is significant or what might happen as a result.
