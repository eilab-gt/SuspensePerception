I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Disorganized and unclear:** The paragraph is grammatically jumbled and lacks a clear narrative flow. This makes it difficult to grasp the situation and build suspense.
* **Missing emotional connection:**  While the topic of a life-or-death organ transplant is inherently suspenseful, the paragraph fails to connect us emotionally to Robert or the medical team. We don't feel their urgency or fear.
* **Telling instead of showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert is in a critical situation and the team is waiting for a donor, but it doesn't show us the tension or the emotional toll this takes.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Be rewritten with clear and concise language.**
* **Focus on sensory details and emotional reactions.**
* **Build tension through pacing and word choice.**
* **Create a sense of urgency and impending danger.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing setup:** The arrival of a helicopter carrying a critical organ immediately piques our interest. We want to know who Robert Bent is and what's at stake.
* **Limited information:** The paragraph leaves us with many unanswered questions. Why is Robert in critical condition? What kind of organ is being transported? What happens next? This lack of information creates a sense of anticipation.
* **Lack of emotional impact:** While the situation is clearly serious, the paragraph doesn't evoke strong emotions in the reader. We don't feel the urgency or the hopefulness of the moment.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Provide more context about Robert Bent's situation.**
* **Describe the helicopter landing and the atmosphere at the hospital in more detail.**
* **Hint at the potential consequences if the transplant is successful or unsuccessful.**
* **End with a cliffhanger that leaves the reader wanting more.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing imagery:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter carrying a "fully functioning liver in a small blue case" is visually striking and immediately grabs our attention. 
* **Mystery and urgency:** We're left wondering who these men are, why they're transporting a liver, and how urgent the situation is. The phrase "fully functioning" adds a sense of importance and potential danger.
* **Lack of context:**  While the imagery is strong, the paragraph lacks context. We don't know who needs the liver, what condition they're in, or what might happen if the transplant isn't successful. This lack of information prevents the suspense from reaching its full potential.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Provide a brief glimpse into Robert Bent's condition and the stakes involved.**
* **Hint at potential obstacles or complications in the transplant process.**
* **Introduce a sense of urgency through the men's actions or dialogue.**
* **End with a question or a cliffhanger that leaves the reader wanting more.**

Here's why:

* **Lack of context:**  We have no idea who the cleaner is, why they are mopping the floor, or what significance the stairwell holds. 
* **Mundane details:** The details provided ("mopping finished," "wet floor sign") are very ordinary and don't create a sense of intrigue or danger.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a character with a motive or a secret.**
* **Hint at a potential threat or danger lurking in the stairwell.**
* **Create a sense of unease through the use of sensory details and atmosphere.**
* **End with a question or a cliffhanger that leaves the reader wanting more.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing action:** The men's decision to take a specific route ("down the stairwell via the roof") suggests they have a reason for secrecy or urgency.
* **Limited information:** We still don't know the full context of the situation, which keeps us guessing about their motives and the potential dangers involved.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Adding sensory details:** Describe the sound of the case hitting the stairs, the man's gasp, or the feeling of the case slipping from his grasp.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying "the case plunged," describe the descent in more detail, emphasizing the potential for disaster.
