I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a child needing a life-saving liver transplant and the ticking clock of a critical situation creates inherent suspense.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The jumbled sentence structure and lack of clear narrative flow make it difficult to fully engage with the suspense.  We don't get a strong sense of Robert's emotional state or the urgency of the situation.
* **Missing Tension:**  While we know the situation is critical, there aren't any specific details or events that build tension. We don't know what obstacles the medical team faces or what might go wrong.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Be rewritten with clearer, more concise sentences.**
* **Focus on Robert's perspective and his feelings about the situation.**
* **Include details about the medical team's efforts and the challenges they face.**
* **Hint at potential complications or setbacks.**
