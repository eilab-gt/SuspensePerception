The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear sense of time pressure and uncertainty about the outcome.

Overall, I would rate the paragraph a 6 or 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

Without these details, the paragraph feels somewhat generic and lacks the specificity and vividness that can make a suspenseful story truly gripping.
