The paragraph starts off with a clear setup for a suspenseful story, detailing the critical situation of a young boy awaiting a liver transplant and the uncertainty of whether he would survive the wait. The mention of the organ's potential damage during transit adds to the tension. However, the last sentence about a woman tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear, which seems unrelated to the main narrative, disrupts the suspense and introduces an element of confusion rather than maintaining or increasing the tension. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The story has elements of high stakes and uncertainty, but the unrelated detail at the end detracts from the overall suspense.

The paragraph presents a scenario with inherent tension due to the critical nature of the situation—a young boy in need of a liver transplant and the arrival of the organ by helicopter. The specificity of the time ("08:57") adds a sense of immediacy and precision, which can heighten suspense. However, the paragraph is quite brief and does not provide additional details that could increase the tension, such as the condition of the organ, the risks involved, or the emotional state of the characters. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness. It sets up a potentially suspenseful situation but does not fully capitalize on the elements that could make it more gripping.

Therefore, I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. It effectively conveys a critical and tense moment in a medical emergency.
