The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a child awaiting a liver transplant and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait. The mention of the real event and the specific details about the time and location add to the sense of urgency and realism. However, the first sentence about the hidden watch is not directly related to the main story and does not contribute to the suspense. Overall, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. 

However, if the hidden watch detail is later revealed to be significant to the story, the suspense level could be higher. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the full impact of this detail.
