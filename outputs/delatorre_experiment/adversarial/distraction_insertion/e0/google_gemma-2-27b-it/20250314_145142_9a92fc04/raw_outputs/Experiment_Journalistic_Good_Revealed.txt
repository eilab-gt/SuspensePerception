I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It starts with a hook:** The opening line about the missing keys is intriguing, but it's quickly abandoned.
* **Shift in tone:** The paragraph abruptly shifts to a factual, almost documentary-like tone, which reduces suspense.
* **Revealing information:** The paragraph reveals key information (the event, the boy's name, the date, the outcome) upfront, leaving little room for mystery or anticipation.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:**  Keep the reader guessing about Robert's fate.
* **Focus on sensory details and emotions:** Describe the tension in the room, the fear of the medical team, Robert's condition.
* **Use shorter sentences and active voice:** Create a faster pace and a sense of urgency.
