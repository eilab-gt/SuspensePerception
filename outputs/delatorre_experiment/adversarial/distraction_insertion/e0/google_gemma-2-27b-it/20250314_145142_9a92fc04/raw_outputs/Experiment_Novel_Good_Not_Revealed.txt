I'd rate the suspensefulness of this paragraph a **3**. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines establish a real-life, high-stakes situation with a ticking clock (Robert's critical condition). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Abrupt Shift:** The last sentence feels disconnected and jarring. The focus shifts from Robert's situation to a seemingly unrelated "she" character and a trivial detail about her hair. This sudden shift undermines the building suspense.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Connect the Sentences:**  The last sentence needs to be linked to Robert's story. Who is "she"? Is she a doctor, a nurse, Robert's mother? How does her action relate to the impending transplant?
* **Heighten the Tension:**  Add details that emphasize the urgency and uncertainty of the situation. Describe Robert's condition, the atmosphere in the hospital, the emotions of those involved.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Building Tension:** The paragraph uses a series of short, impactful sentences that create a sense of unease and disorientation. The repeated pattern of someone trying to do something but failing adds to the feeling of something being wrong.
* **Intriguing Details:** The details about the helicopter landing and Robert's condition provide context and raise questions. Why is "she" reaching for a railing that isn't there? What is she trying to write? Why are "he" and "she" experiencing these strange occurrences?
* **Lack of Resolution:** The paragraph ends abruptly without resolving any of the questions it raises. This leaves the reader wanting to know more and creates a sense of anticipation.

**To further enhance the suspense:**

* **Sensory Details:** Add more sensory details to immerse the reader in the scene. Describe the sounds, smells, and sights that "she" and "he" are experiencing.
* **Character Focus:**  Focus on the internal thoughts and feelings of one of the characters. This will help the reader connect with them and feel their anxiety.
* **Foreshadowing:**  Hint at a potential danger or threat to increase the sense of urgency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The context of a life-saving organ transplant and the mention of a "critical situation" immediately establish a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Action and Movement:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, carrying the vital organ, and rushing towards the exit creates a sense of movement and purpose.
* **Limited Information:** The paragraph focuses on the physical actions and doesn't delve into the characters' thoughts or emotions. This creates a sense of distance and mystery, leaving the reader wondering about their motivations and concerns.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful tasks of a hospital cleaner. This creates a sense of normalcy and predictability, which works against suspense.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There's no immediate threat or danger present. The cleaner is simply going about his daily work.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Hint at a potential danger lurking in the stairwell. Perhaps there's a strange noise, a flickering light, or a sense of being watched.
* **Focus on the Cleaner's Perspective:**  Explore the cleaner's thoughts and feelings. Is he noticing anything unusual? Does he feel uneasy about something?
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Introduce a time constraint or a reason for the cleaner to hurry. Perhaps he's late for a meeting, or he's worried about missing something important.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Successful Procedure:** The successful biopsy and the positive initial results provide a sense of relief, temporarily easing the tension.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Abrupt Shift:** The paragraph starts with a sense of urgency and anticipation, but the mention of the clock chiming midnight, followed by the statement that there's no clock, creates a jarring and confusing effect. This undermines the suspense.
* **Delayed Resolution:** The confirmation that the transplant was successful is a relief, but it comes after a long wait and a confusing detour. This weakens the impact of the positive outcome.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Maintain Focus:**  Stick to the central narrative of the transplant and the characters directly involved. Avoid introducing unrelated details or distractions.
* **Build Tension Gradually:**  Instead of abruptly revealing the successful outcome, create a sense of anticipation and uncertainty. Describe the team's careful monitoring, their anxious waiting, and their growing hope.
* **Connect the Sentences:**  Ensure that each sentence flows logically from the previous one and contributes to the overall suspense. Avoid jarring transitions or irrelevant details.
