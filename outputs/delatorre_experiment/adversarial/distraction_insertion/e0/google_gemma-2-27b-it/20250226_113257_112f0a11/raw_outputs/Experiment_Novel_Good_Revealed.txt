The paragraph you provided scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Initial Setup:** The beginning establishes a potentially suspenseful scenario with a real-life medical emergency. The mention of a critical situation and a race against time could create tension.
* **Abrupt Shift:** However, the paragraph abruptly shifts to a seemingly unrelated detail about a hidden watch. This shift breaks the suspense built in the first part and leaves the reader confused.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Connect the Watch:**  The watch needs to be directly related to the medical situation. Perhaps it's a crucial timer, a memento from the boy, or something the doctor needs to find.
* **Build Tension:**  Focus on the emotional and physical struggles of the boy and the medical team during the wait. Describe their anxieties, hopes, and fears.
* **Delay Resolution:** Don't reveal the outcome of the transplant so quickly. Keep the reader wondering if Robert will survive.
