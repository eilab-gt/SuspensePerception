I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines establish a real-life scenario and a high-stakes situation (a child needing a liver transplant). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the organ introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Sudden Shift:** The last sentence about Robert looking for his watch feels out of place and somewhat jarring. It doesn't directly contribute to the suspense built up so far.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Connect the Watch:**  Make the watch relevant to the situation. Is it a special watch? Does it have a connection to Robert's illness or the transplant?
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  Describe Robert's deteriorating condition in more detail. Show the anxiety of the medical team.
* **End on a Cliffhanger:** Instead of simply stating "This is the story of what happened," leave the reader with a question or a hint of something ominous to come.

* **Punctual Arrival:** The helicopter landing on time adds a sense of hope, but also a subtle tension – will everything go smoothly now?
* **Unrelated Detail:** The watch detail again feels disconnected and doesn't contribute to the suspense. It's unclear why it's mentioned.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert:** Describe his emotions and thoughts as he hears the helicopter. Is he hopeful? Scared?
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe physical signs that convey his fragility.
* **Omit the Watch:** Unless it becomes relevant later, remove this detail. It distracts from the central tension.

* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of the cleaner looking for his watch is distracting and pointless. It doesn't add anything to the story.
* **Lack of Tension:** There are no hints of danger, conflict, or mystery. The cleaner's actions are purely mechanical and lack emotional weight.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Hint at something amiss in the stairwell – a strange noise, an out-of-place object, a feeling of being watched.
* **Connect to the Main Plot:**  Make the cleaner's actions relevant to Robert's situation. Perhaps he overhears a conversation or notices something unusual that could impact the transplant.
* **Create Foreshadowing:**  Subtly suggest that something bad is about to happen, even if the cleaner is unaware of it.
