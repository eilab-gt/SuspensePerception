The paragraph begins with a setup that suggests a significant event will unfold, which can be a good foundation for suspense. The mention of a real event at a children's hospital, a specific date, and the preparation for a liver transplant all contribute to a sense of urgency and importance. The introduction of the young boy, Robert Bent, and the critical nature of his condition add emotional stakes to the narrative.

However, the suspense is somewhat undercut by the revelation in the middle of the paragraph that Robert Bent passes away without receiving the transplant. This information, while tragic, resolves the primary tension of the story prematurely, which can reduce the suspensefulness for the reader. The suspense that might have been sustained by the question of whether Robert would survive and receive the transplant is lost once his death is confirmed.

The final sentence hints at a story behind the story, suggesting there is more to uncover, which could potentially reignite the reader's curiosity. However, the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph is moderate because the main source of tension—Robert's fate—is resolved too quickly within the text provided.

This paragraph introduces an element of suspense with the mention of a helicopter carrying an organ landing at the hospital where Robert Bent is awaiting a transplant. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the description of the situation as "critical but stable" contribute to a sense of urgency and the potential for a dramatic turn of events.

The mention of Robert looking for his hidden watch and not being able to find it adds a layer of personal tension and could imply that time is of the essence or that there is some significance to the watch that could impact the story. This could be a metaphor for lost time or a race against the clock, which are classic elements of suspense.

However, the paragraph is quite brief and does not develop the situation further, which limits the buildup of suspense. The reader is left with questions about the significance of the watch, the condition of the organ upon arrival, and what will happen next to Robert. The suspense is present but not fully developed, hence the moderate rating.

This paragraph effectively builds suspense. The vivid description of the helicopter landing, the men emerging with the blue case, and the urgency conveyed by their actions all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The specific detail about the temperature of the liver and its importance in maintaining functionality adds to the stakes, emphasizing the delicate nature of the situation.

The inaudible shouting and the subsequent non-verbal communication between the men suggest a high-pressure environment where every second counts. The mention of the hidden watch again introduces an element of personal tension or a potential time constraint that is not fully explained, which can intrigue the reader.

The final sentence reiterates the critical condition of the patient and the need for haste, reinforcing the urgency and the potential for a dramatic outcome. The paragraph ends without resolving the situation, leaving the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of anticipation for what might happen next. This open-endedness and the accumulation of tension-building details contribute to a suspenseful reading experience.

This paragraph is not particularly suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine morning task of mopping the hospital's service stairwell. The narrative is more focused on setting the scene and describing the cleaner's job and his preferences for interacting with people in the corridors rather than the isolated stairwell.

The repetition of the cleaner looking for and not finding his hidden watch introduces a minor mystery but does not significantly contribute to suspense, as it seems more like a personal issue unrelated to the larger narrative. The description of the cleaner's work and his routine does not suggest any imminent danger or dramatic event that might affect the story's outcome.

While the paragraph does a good job of painting a picture of the cleaner's daily activities and the hospital environment, it lacks elements that typically create suspense, such as impending danger, uncertainty, or a sense of conflict. The cleaner's whistling and the ease with which he completes his task convey a sense of normalcy rather than tension. The mention of the "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but this is not developed into a suspenseful situation within the paragraph provided. Therefore, on the suspense scale, this paragraph would rank lower due to its focus on routine and lack of immediate tension or stakes.

The repeated action of one of the men looking for his hidden watch and not finding it adds a layer of personal tension or distraction that could have implications for the mission's success. This repetition suggests that the watch might be significant to the timing or outcome of the transplant.

The decision to use the stairs instead of waiting for the lift introduces a sense of urgency and a strategic choice that could impact the story's outcome. The fact that the patient is on the 6th floor and that taking the stairs might be faster than waiting for the lift adds to the tension, as it implies that time is of the essence and that there may be unforeseen delays.

The paragraph ends with the men beginning their descent down the service stairwell, leaving the reader to wonder about potential obstacles they might encounter and whether they will make it to the patient in time. The suspense is moderate to high, as the stakes are clear, and the outcome is yet to be determined.

The dialogue between the two men, with one warning the other not to move the case, adds to the drama and emphasizes the delicate nature of their task. The decision to have one man stay with the case while the other goes to alert the medical team creates a sense of division and vulnerability, as the case is left unattended except for the presence of one of the couriers.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful, as it culminates in the critical moment of discovering whether the liver has survived the fall undamaged. The detailed description of the doctor opening the case, the tension in the room palpable as everyone watches, and the brief but clear non-verbal reaction from the doctor all contribute to a sense of impending doom.

The click of the case handle, the revelation of the padded interior designed to protect the organ, and the doctor's head shake after a brief inspection create a dramatic and heart-sinking moment. The specific detail of the fridge being ruptured and the refrigerated air escaping not only indicates that the case has been compromised but also suggests that the organ may have been exposed to temperatures that could affect its viability.

The suspense is intensified by the fact that the paragraph ends without revealing the condition of the liver itself. The reader is left with a strong sense of concern for the patient's fate, as the thin stream of refrigerated air escaping from the case symbolizes the fragile hope for a successful transplant slipping away.

The repeated action of looking for the hidden watch and not finding it continues to add a layer of tension, though its relevance to the main event is still unclear.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. It describes a critical and delicate medical procedure that will determine the viability of the liver for transplantation. The detailed account of the organ's transfer to the hepatology laboratory, the initial positive signs regarding its condition, and the necessity of a biopsy to assess the metabolic rate all contribute to a high-stakes environment.

The focus on the surgeon's preparation for the biopsy, his nervousness due to the gravity of the situation—a child's life hanging in the balance—and the precision required for the procedure (one millimetre could cause irreparable damage) all serve to heighten the tension. The surgeon's mask and the others in the laboratory giving him space underscore the seriousness and isolation of the moment.

The repeated action of the surgeon looking for his hidden watch and not finding it adds to the suspense, possibly indicating a personal struggle or a time-sensitive aspect of the situation that is not yet fully explained. This repetition could also reflect the surgeon's internal tension and the immense pressure he feels to perform the biopsy correctly.

The specific time of death (21:26) adds a note of finality to the situation, emphasizing the definitive end to the medical team's efforts and the patient's life.

While the suspense regarding the outcome of the transplant has been resolved, the paragraph still carries a degree of suspense due to the unresolved issue of the hidden watch. The repeated and futile search for the watch continues to suggest an underlying tension or personal struggle that has not been explained or resolved within the narrative. This lingering mystery can intrigue the reader and leave them with questions about the significance of the watch.
