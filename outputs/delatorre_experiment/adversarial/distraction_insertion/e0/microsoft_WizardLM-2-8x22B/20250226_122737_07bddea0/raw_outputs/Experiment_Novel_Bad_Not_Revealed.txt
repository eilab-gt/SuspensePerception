This paragraph contains elements that contribute to suspense, such as the precise timing of the helicopter's arrival and the mention of the boy's critical condition. The detail of the boy looking for his hidden watch and not being able to find it adds a sense of personal urgency and may hint at a larger issue related to the timing of the transplant. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the information that the boy is in a "critical but stable condition," which suggests that his immediate survival is not in imminent danger. The suspense is present but not as heightened as it could be if the boy's condition were described as rapidly deteriorating or if there were clearer immediate threats or obstacles to the transplant procedure.
