The paragraph begins with a setup that suggests a high-stakes situation—a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant—which is a classic scenario for building suspense. The mention of the critical condition of Robert Bent and the uncertainty of whether he would survive the wait adds to the tension. However, the suspense is undercut by the revelation of the boy's death before the transplant could take place, which occurs relatively early in the paragraph. The final sentence, which introduces an element of mystery with the hidden watch, attempts to rekindle the suspense but comes too late to salvage the overall impact. The suspensefulness of the paragraph is moderate because the outcome of the central conflict (the boy's survival) is revealed prematurely, and the introduction of a new element (the watch) is not sufficiently developed to maintain high suspense.

Overall, the paragraph is quite suspenseful, as it combines the urgency of a medical drama with an intriguing personal detail that suggests there is more to the story than meets the eye.

This paragraph maintains a moderate level of suspense.
