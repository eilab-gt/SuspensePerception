The critical condition of the boy and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait for the organ create a sense of tension and anticipation. The reader is left wondering about the outcome of the situation, which is a key component of suspenseful storytelling.

This paragraph builds on the established suspense from the previous context by introducing a moment of punctuality and precision with the helicopter's landing. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival contribute to the tension, as it is a pivotal moment in the transplant process. The reference to Robert Bent's condition as "critical but stable" keeps the reader's concern for his well-being at the forefront.
