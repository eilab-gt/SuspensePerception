I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The introduction of the protagonist, Robert Bent, and the medical team creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* The mention of the critical situation and the uncertainty of Robert's survival creates tension and suspense.
* The use of specific times and details, such as the exact time of the transplant (21:26), adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more intense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more anticipation and expectation before revealing the outcome of the transplant.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and the emotions of the characters.
* Introduced more obstacles or complications that the medical team had to overcome, making the outcome less certain.

Overall, the paragraph is engaging and suspenseful, but could benefit from a few tweaks to make it even more gripping.
