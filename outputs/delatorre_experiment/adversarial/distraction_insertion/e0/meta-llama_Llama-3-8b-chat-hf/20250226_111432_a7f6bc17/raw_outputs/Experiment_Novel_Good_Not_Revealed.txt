I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real location, which adds a sense of authenticity and grounding to the story.
* The introduction of the protagonist, Robert, and the medical team, creates a sense of tension and urgency, as they are waiting for a critical liver transplant.
* The mention of Robert's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense.
* The sudden introduction of the watch, which Robert can't find, creates a sense of mystery and raises questions in the reader's mind (e.g., why is the watch important? What will happen if Robert can't find it?).
* However, the paragraph is still quite straightforward and lacks a strong sense of foreboding or menace, which might make it less suspenseful.

To increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph, the author could add more details that create a sense of unease or uncertainty, such as:

* More vivid descriptions of Robert's condition and the medical team's concerns.
* A sense of time pressure, such as a countdown to the transplant or a warning that the donor organ might not arrive on time.
* More hints about the significance of the watch, such as a mention of its sentimental value or a hint that it might hold a clue to the mystery that unfolds.
* A more ominous tone or language that creates a sense of foreboding.
