I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention.  
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child in need of a life-saving transplant with time running out.
* **Missing Watch:** The detail about the boy looking for his watch adds a touch of mystery and personalizes the situation.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, the paragraph doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or a ticking clock. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* Focus on Robert's emotional state and physical deterioration.
* Introduce a new element of uncertainty or a potential complication.
* Use more active verbs and sensory details to create a more immersive experience.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Increased Urgency:** The specific time and the arrival of the helicopter create a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Contrasting Information:** The juxtaposition of Robert's critical but stable condition with the helicopter's arrival heightens the tension. Will the organ arrive in time?

**However:**

* **Still Telling, Not Showing:** We're told Robert is in a critical but stable condition, but we don't see any evidence of this.
* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of Robert looking for his watch feels out of place and doesn't contribute to the suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Describe Robert's physical state, his breathing, his pain, or his emotional turmoil.
* **Focus on the Organ:**  Describe the organ's journey, the care it's receiving, and the anticipation surrounding its arrival.
* **Introduce a Conflict:**  Perhaps there's a delay, a complication, or a last-minute obstacle that threatens the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Visual Detail:** The description of the "small blue fridge" carrying the liver is intriguing and creates a tangible image in the reader's mind.
* **Sense of Importance:** The phrase "fully functioning liver" emphasizes the gravity of the situation.

**However:**

* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of Robert looking for his watch is still distracting and doesn't contribute to the suspense.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We still don't feel a strong emotional connection to Robert or the situation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on the Organ:**  Describe the liver's journey from the helicopter to the operating room.  
* **Show the Medical Team's Reactions:**  How do they react to the arrival of the organ? Are they relieved, anxious, or focused?
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Perhaps there's a time limit for the transplant, or a complication arises.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Connection:** The paragraph introduces a new character (the cleaner) and a seemingly unrelated event (mopping the floor) without establishing a clear connection to the main plot (Robert's transplant).
* **Unclear Stakes:**  Why is the missing "wet floor" sign important? What are the potential consequences?
* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of Robert looking for his watch is even more jarring in this context, as it feels completely disconnected from the cleaner's actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Establish a Link:**  Find a way to connect the cleaner's actions to Robert's situation. Perhaps the cleaner's negligence creates a hazard that threatens the transplant team or the organ itself.
* **Raise the Stakes:**  Make the consequences of the missing sign more significant.  
* **Remove the Watch Detail:** This detail is distracting and doesn't serve the story.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Shift in Focus:** The paragraph shifts focus to the men transporting the liver, which is a positive development as it brings us closer to the crucial organ.
* **Choice of Stairwell:**  The decision to use the service stairwell introduces a sense of secrecy or perhaps even a potential shortcut, which could add intrigue.

**However:**

* **Lack of Tension:**  The paragraph lacks a sense of urgency or danger. The men simply "decided to walk down" the stairs.
* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of Robert looking for his watch is completely out of place and detracts from the suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Perhaps the stairwell is dimly lit, there's a strange noise, or they encounter someone unexpected.
* **Highlight the Importance of the Organ:**  Describe the liver's fragility or the men's careful handling of it.
* **Remove the Watch Detail:** This detail is completely irrelevant to the story and should be removed.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Sudden Action:** The paragraph starts with a sudden, unexpected event – the man slipping and the case falling. This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **High Stakes:** The falling case containing the vital organ creates a sense of immediate danger and raises the stakes significantly.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering what will happen to the liver and Robert.

**However:**

* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know how far the case falls, if it's damaged, or what the men do next. More descriptive details would enhance the suspense.
* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of Robert looking for his watch is still distracting and doesn't contribute to the story.

**To increase the suspense even further:**

* **Describe the Fall:**  Describe the sound of the case hitting the stairs, the men's reactions, and the potential damage to the liver.
* **Show the Consequences:**  What happens next? Do they retrieve the case? Is the liver damaged?

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Rising Tension:** The paragraph builds on the previous one's cliffhanger, introducing a sense of urgency as one man rushes to warn the doctors.
* **Focus on the Organ:** The emphasis on the case being "not handled in any way" highlights the fragility of the liver and the importance of its safe arrival.

* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know how long it takes for the doctors to arrive, or what the man supervising the case is doing while he waits.
* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of Robert looking for his watch is completely out of place and detracts from the suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show the Man's Anxiety:** Describe his physical and emotional state as he waits for the doctors. Is he panicking? Trying to assess the damage?
* **Create a Sense of Time:**  Use phrases like "minutes ticked by" or "every second felt like an eternity" to emphasize the urgency of the situation.
* **Remove the Watch Detail:** This detail is completely irrelevant to the story and should be removed.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show the Doctors' Reactions:** Describe their expressions, their movements, and their words as they assess the situation.

* **Remove the Watch Detail:** This detail is completely irrelevant to the story and should be removed.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Shift in Pace:** The paragraph slows down the pace after the high-stakes revelation of the ruptured bag. 
* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know the results of the biopsy, the surgeon's reaction, or how long the process takes. This lack of information reduces the tension.

**However:**

* **Important Action:** The move to the hepatic laboratory and the biopsy are crucial steps in determining the fate of the liver and Robert.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating the surgeon carried out a biopsy, describe the procedure, the surgeon's expressions, and the atmosphere in the lab.
* **Create Uncertainty:**  Hint at the possibility of the liver being beyond repair or that there might be complications.

This paragraph is incredibly effective at building suspense and delivering a powerful emotional punch.  The combination of the tragic outcome, the specific details, and the lack of any extraneous elements creates a truly suspenseful and memorable ending.
