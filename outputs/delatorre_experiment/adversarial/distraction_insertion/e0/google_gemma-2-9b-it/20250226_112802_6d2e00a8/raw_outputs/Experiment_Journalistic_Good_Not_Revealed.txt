I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention.  
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child needing a life-saving transplant with time running out.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the stakes are high, the paragraph doesn't present an immediate, tangible threat. We know Robert is in danger, but we don't see a specific danger unfolding.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The "This is the story of what happened" ending creates a slight sense of anticipation, wanting to know what unfolds.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Make the time pressure more explicit.  
* **Add sensory details:** Describe Robert's condition, the hospital atmosphere, or the team's anxious energy.
* **Hint at a complication:**  Suggest something unexpected might happen during the wait.

Here's why:

* **Increased Urgency:** The specific time and the helicopter's arrival create a sense of urgency and immediacy.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Introduced Element of Danger:** The missing "wet floor" sign creates a potential hazard, raising the stakes and introducing a sense of danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

* **Connect the watch to the doctors:** Maybe the watch holds a clue about Robert's condition, or it's somehow related to the doctors' actions.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Shift in Action:** The paragraph moves away from the immediate crisis of the ruptured bag and into a more clinical setting. While this is realistic, it reduces the immediate tension.
