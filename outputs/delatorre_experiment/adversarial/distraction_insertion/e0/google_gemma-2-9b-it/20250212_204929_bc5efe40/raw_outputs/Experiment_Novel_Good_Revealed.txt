I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a real event and a life-or-death situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Building Tension:** The details about the imminent transplant, the critical condition, and the search for the watch create a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Lack of Clear Threat:**  While the situation is serious, the paragraph doesn't clearly establish a specific threat or danger. We know Robert is in danger, but the nature of the threat isn't fully defined.
* **Resolution Too Early:** The paragraph ends with the successful transplant, which deflates some of the suspense. 

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on the unknown:**  Highlight the uncertainty surrounding the transplant's success or the potential complications.
* **Introduce a conflict:**  Add an unexpected obstacle or challenge that threatens the transplant.
* **Delay the resolution:**  Leave the outcome of the transplant in question until later in the story.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful nature of the cleaner's job. There's little to suggest anything out of the ordinary is happening.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There are no apparent threats, obstacles, or mysteries to keep the reader engaged.
* **Unrelated Watch:** The mention of the cleaner looking for his watch feels disconnected from the rest of the paragraph and doesn't contribute to any suspense.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a change in routine:**  Perhaps the cleaner notices something unusual in the stairwell, or someone unexpected is present.
* **Hint at a hidden danger:**  The description could subtly suggest a potential threat, like a strange noise or a feeling of being watched.
* **Connect the watch to the story:**  Make the missing watch a significant detail, perhaps it holds a clue or is connected to a past event.

* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While there's a sense of urgency, there's no immediate danger or obstacle presented. The suspense is more about the potential for delays and complications.
* **Unrelated Watch:**  Again, the watch search feels disconnected from the main plot and doesn't contribute to the suspense.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Highlight the importance of time:** Emphasize the critical nature of the situation and the potential consequences of delays.
* **Introduce a potential obstacle:** Perhaps there's a security checkpoint, a malfunctioning stairwell, or a sudden change in the patient's condition.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Use sensory details or subtle hints to suggest something is amiss, like a strange noise or a feeling of being watched.

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a clear resolution to the central conflict: the liver is functioning correctly. This naturally reduces the suspense.
* **Delayed Gratification:** The suspense is built up throughout the previous paragraphs, leading to this moment of relief. However, the paragraph itself doesn't contain much action or tension.

**What could make it more suspenseful:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating that the liver is functioning correctly, describe the signs of improvement in Robert's condition.
* **Lingering Uncertainty:**  Introduce a small doubt or complication, even if it's quickly resolved. For example, the doctors could initially be unsure about the liver's function, creating a brief moment of worry before confirming its success.
