I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

* **Building Tension:** The paragraph highlights the critical nature of Robert's situation and the uncertainty surrounding his survival. The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" effectively introduces suspense.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a clear, immediate threat presented in this paragraph. We know Robert is in danger, but we don't know what specific challenges he faces during the wait.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

*  Introduce a specific obstacle or complication that arises during the wait.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Shift in Pace:**  The paragraph slows down the pace after the intense reveal of the ruptured bag. This can be a good technique to build tension, but it needs to be done carefully.

* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** We don't feel the urgency or the weight of the situation from the doctors' perspective.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating the surgeon carried out a biopsy, describe the process, the tension in the room, or the surgeon's focused expression.

* **Include a character's thought:**  Give us a glimpse into the surgeon's mind – their doubts, their determination, or their fear of failure.
