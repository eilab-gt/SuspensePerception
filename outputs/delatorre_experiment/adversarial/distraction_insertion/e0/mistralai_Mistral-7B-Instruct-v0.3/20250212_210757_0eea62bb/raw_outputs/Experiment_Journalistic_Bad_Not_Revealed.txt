 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not add to the suspense of the situation and instead seems to be a tangential detail that does not contribute to the overall tension of the story. The mention of the cleaner and the wet floor could potentially create a sense of danger or potential complications, but it is not developed or integrated into the story in a way that builds suspense. The repetition of the phrase "he couldn't find it" does not add to the tension in this context.  To make this paragraph more suspenseful, it could be rewritten to show how the cleaner's actions may have contributed to the situation or how they may have impacted the medical team or the boy.  For example, "Minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign. As the medical team rushed to the operating room with the organ, they slipped on the wet floor, causing a delay in the transplant."  This rewrite adds to the suspense by creating a sense of urgency and potential complications due to the cleaner's actions.
