 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ adds a sense of urgency and tension, and the missing watch continues to build suspense as it suggests that time is running out. The use of the specific time (08:57) also adds to the suspense as it creates a sense of immediacy and anticipation.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The arrival of the men and the small blue fridge containing the liver adds to the tension and suspense, as does the continued mention of the missing watch. The use of the phrase "fully functioning liver" also emphasizes the importance of the organ and the high stakes of the situation.  The repetition of the phrase "he couldn't find it" also adds to the suspense as it suggests that something is wrong or out of place.  The reader is left wondering if the missing watch will have an impact on the transplant and the boy's survival.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. While the mention of the cleaner and the "wet floor" adds a sense of danger and potential complications, the paragraph does not directly relate to the main storyline of the liver transplant. The repetition of the phrase "he couldn't find it" also detracts from the suspense, as it becomes repetitive and less impactful. The paragraph could be more effective if it was more directly tied to the main storyline or if it contained more immediate tension or unexpected elements.  The reader may be left wondering why the cleaner's actions are relevant to the story, but the connection is not immediately clear.

However, the paragraph does not reach a higher rating as it does not provide enough immediate tension or unexpected elements to fully engage the reader.  The reader may be left feeling a sense of anticipation, but the paragraph does not fully deliver on the promise of suspense.
