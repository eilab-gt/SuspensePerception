 6.5

While the initial part of the paragraph sets up a suspenseful scenario with a critical situation and an imminent liver transplant, the second part shifts focus to a character (Robert Bent) looking for his watch, which seems unrelated to the initial suspenseful setup. This shift in focus reduces the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph. However, if the watch-related detail is significant to the story's development or resolution, the suspensefulness could potentially increase.

In this revised paragraph, the focus remains on the critical situation of Robert Bent and the arrival of the organ, which creates a sense of urgency and tension. The addition of the helicopter landing punctually adds to the suspense, as it suggests that time is running out for Robert. The second sentence about Robert looking for his hidden watch still seems unrelated to the main suspenseful scenario, but it doesn't detract significantly from the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.
