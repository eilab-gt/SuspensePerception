 I would rate the paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively sets the scene for a high-stakes situation, with the medical team waiting for a liver transplant for a critically ill eight-year-old boy. The detail that the boy is searching for his hidden watch adds a sense of urgency and mystery, making the reader wonder why it's important and what will happen next.

 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, the suspense is undercut by the fact that the reader is told that Robert is in a "critical but stable" condition. This takes away some of the urgency and uncertainty about his fate. Additionally, the paragraph repeats the detail about Robert looking for his hidden watch, which was already mentioned in the previous paragraph. While this repetition could be used to emphasize the importance of the watch, it also feels slightly redundant and lessens the impact of the detail. Overall, the paragraph provides some suspense but could be improved with more attention to the pacing and development of the tension.

 I would rate the paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension with the description of the helicopter's arrival and the urgency of the situation, with the medical team having "no time to lose." The detail about the liver being stored at a specific temperature and the use of the word "compatible" also adds to the stakes of the situation. The repetition of the detail about Robert looking for his hidden watch, however, still feels slightly redundant and lessens the impact of the detail. Overall, the paragraph provides a good amount of suspense but could be improved with more attention to the pacing and development of the tension. 

The addition of the dialogue between the two men, even if it's inaudible, it gives a sense of urgency and realism to the scene. Also, the fact that they are aware of the critical situation of the patient, it adds to the tension and the reader is more invested in finding out what will happen next.

 I would rate the paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph focuses on the mundane and uneventful task of a cleaner mopping the service stairwell of the hospital. While the description of the setting is detailed and vivid, it does not contribute to the development of tension or suspense. The detail about the cleaner looking for his hidden watch is not relevant to the main story and does not add to the suspense. Overall, the paragraph does not create a sense of anticipation or uncertainty for the reader and does not contribute to the suspense of the overall story.

It is a well written paragraph, but it doesn't add anything to the story, it doesn't create any sense of tension or anticipation, it doesn't make the reader wonder what will happen next. It is a descriptive paragraph but it doesn't serve the purpose of creating suspense.
