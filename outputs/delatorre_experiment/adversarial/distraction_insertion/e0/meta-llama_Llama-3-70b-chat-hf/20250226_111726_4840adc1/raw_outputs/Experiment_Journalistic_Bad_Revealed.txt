I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph starts strong, setting up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing a critical medical situation and a life-or-death scenario. The use of specific details like the date, time, and location adds to the sense of realism and raises the stakes. The phrase "his situation was critical" effectively conveys the urgency of the situation.

However, the paragraph takes a unexpected turn with the sudden introduction of a new, seemingly unrelated detail about Robert looking for his hidden watch. This shift in focus disrupts the building tension and creates a sense of disconnection from the main storyline. It's unclear how the watch is relevant to the story, which makes it feel like a non-sequitur.

If the paragraph had continued to build on the tension and suspense of the medical situation, it could have been even more effective in creating a sense of suspense. As it stands, the abrupt shift in focus dilutes the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.
