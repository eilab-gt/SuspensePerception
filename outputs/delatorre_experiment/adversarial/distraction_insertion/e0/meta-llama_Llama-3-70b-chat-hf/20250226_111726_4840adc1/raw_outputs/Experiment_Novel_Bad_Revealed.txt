I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph starts by setting up a sense of anticipation and importance, stating that it's a true story and providing specific details about the event. The introduction of Robert Bent, an 8-year-old boy in critical condition, creates a sense of emotional investment and concern for the reader.

The paragraph builds tension by describing the preparations for the liver transplant and the uncertainty surrounding Robert's survival. The use of specific times (8 a.m. and 21:26) adds to the sense of urgency and creates a sense of ticking clock.

However, the suspense is somewhat diminished by the fact that the outcome is already known from the beginning. The paragraph states that Robert's death will be certified, which takes away some of the surprise and tension. Additionally, the sentence "This is the story of what happened" feels like a bit of a letdown, as it's a somewhat abrupt transition from the dramatic events described to a more matter-of-fact tone.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some suspense and emotional investment, it could be more effective in building tension and surprise if it didn't give away the outcome so early on.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The first sentence sets a sense of anticipation and importance, as it describes the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ for Robert's liver transplant. The use of a specific time (08:57) adds to the sense of urgency and creates a sense of precision.

However, the second and third sentences ("He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.") are completely unrelated to the main story and seem out of place. They disrupt the flow of the narrative and create a sense of confusion. The sudden introduction of a character looking for a hidden watch has no clear connection to the story of Robert Bent and his liver transplant, and it doesn't add any tension or suspense to the narrative.

Overall, the paragraph starts strong but is derailed by the unrelated and confusing sentences, making it not very suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension from the start, with the dramatic description of the helicopter landing and the two men descending from it. The use of vivid details like "heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades" helps to create a sense of intensity.

The introduction of the blue case containing the liver adds to the sense of importance and raises the stakes, as the reader knows that time is of the essence for Robert's transplant. The fact that the men are told that the patient is in a critical situation and they have no time to lose adds to the sense of urgency.

However, the sentence "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it." is still out of place and disrupts the flow of the narrative. It's unclear why this detail is included, and it takes away from the tension and suspense that's building around the liver transplant.

Despite this, the paragraph does a good job of creating a sense of tension and urgency, and the reader is left wondering if the transplant will be successful and if Robert will survive. The use of descriptive language and the focus on the critical situation of the patient make this paragraph more suspenseful than the previous ones.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is not suspenseful at all. It's a descriptive passage about a cleaner's daily routine, and it's written in a very matter-of-fact and mundane tone. The details about the cleaner's job, the hospital's layout, and the cleaning process are all very ordinary and don't create any sense of tension or anticipation.

The repeated sentences "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.." are still out of place and disrupt the flow of the narrative, but they don't add any suspense or intrigue to the story. They seem like a non-sequitur and don't make sense in the context of the cleaner's daily routine.

The paragraph is more focused on describing the cleaner's job and the hospital's environment than on creating any sense of suspense or tension. The tone is very relaxed and casual, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next or feeling any sense of anticipation. Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful at all.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph starts to build some tension and suspense as it describes the route that the two men take to get to the patient's room.

However, the repeated sentences "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.." are still out of place and disrupt the flow of the narrative. They don't add to the suspense or tension, and instead create a sense of confusion and distraction.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of building some tension and suspense, but it's not as effective as it could be due to the inclusion of the unnecessary and confusing sentences about the hidden watch.

This paragraph is somewhat suspenseful because it finally reveals the outcome of the story, which is the death of Robert Bent. The use of a specific time, "21:26", adds to the sense of finality and creates a sense of closure.
