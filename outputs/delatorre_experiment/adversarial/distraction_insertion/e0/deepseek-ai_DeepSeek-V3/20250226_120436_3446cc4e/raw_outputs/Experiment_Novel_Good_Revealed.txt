I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- The paragraph starts with a potentially suspenseful setup: a critical liver transplant for a young boy, with uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait. This creates some tension.
- However, the suspense is undercut by the immediate resolution provided in the same paragraph ("Finally, at 21:26, the medical team verified that Robert Bent’s newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly"). This removes much of the tension.
- The abrupt shift to the unrelated detail about the hidden watch at the end feels disjointed and does not contribute to the suspense. It actually detracts from the narrative flow.

Overall, while there is a hint of suspense in the initial setup, the paragraph does not sustain or build it effectively.
