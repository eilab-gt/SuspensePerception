I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a potentially tense situation with a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The mention of his critical condition and the uncertainty about whether he would survive the wait adds some tension.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is undermined by the immediate resolution provided in the same paragraph. Knowing that the transplant was successful and the liver was functioning correctly by the end of the paragraph removes much of the tension. Additionally, the writing style is somewhat clinical and lacks vivid details or emotional depth that could heighten the suspense.

Overall, while there is a hint of suspense, it is not sustained or developed enough to make it highly suspenseful.
