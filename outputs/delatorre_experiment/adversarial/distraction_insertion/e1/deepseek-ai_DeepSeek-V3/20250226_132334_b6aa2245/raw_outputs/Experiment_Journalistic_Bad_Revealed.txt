I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- The paragraph starts with a strong setup, introducing a real-life, high-stakes situation involving a critically ill child awaiting a liver transplant. This creates a sense of urgency and tension.
- The uncertainty about whether Robert would survive the wait adds to the suspense.
- However, the suspense is somewhat diminished by the abrupt revelation of Robert's death early in the paragraph, which resolves the tension prematurely.
- The final sentence about the hidden watch feels disconnected and unrelated to the main narrative, which detracts from the overall suspense.

While the story has potential for suspense, the structure and pacing reduce its impact.
