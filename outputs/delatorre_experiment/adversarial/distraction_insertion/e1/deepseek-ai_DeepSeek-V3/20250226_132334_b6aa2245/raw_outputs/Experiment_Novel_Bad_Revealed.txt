I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The uncertainty about whether the organ will arrive in time and the tragic outcome create a sense of tension and emotional weight. The specific details, such as the time of death and the reason for the failed transplant, add to the realism and gravity of the situation.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the abrupt reveal of the outcome early in the paragraph ("Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent"). This reduces the buildup of tension that could have been achieved by delaying the resolution. Additionally, the opening sentence about the hidden watch feels disconnected from the main narrative, which slightly detracts from the focus.

Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful due to the life-and-death scenario, but it could have been more effective with a more gradual reveal of the outcome.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The mention of a helicopter carrying an organ for a critical patient introduces a sense of urgency and importance. The phrase "critical but stable condition" hints at the high stakes involved.

- **Weaknesses**: The paragraph lacks significant tension or uncertainty. The helicopter landing "punctually" suggests that everything is going according to plan, which reduces suspense. Additionally, the sentence about the hidden watch feels out of place and unrelated to the main narrative, further diluting the suspense.

Overall, while there is a hint of urgency, the paragraph does not build or sustain much suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The description of the scene is vivid and dynamic, with details like the spinning rotors, the men ducking down, and the urgency of the situation. The mention of the patient being in a "critical situation" and the need to act quickly adds tension. The blue case containing the liver at a precise temperature also emphasizes the importance of the mission.

- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat undercut by the inclusion of the sentence about the hidden watch, which feels unrelated and distracting. Additionally, while there is a sense of urgency, the paragraph does not introduce any significant obstacles or uncertainties that would heighten the suspense further.

- **Strengths**: The paragraph provides a detailed and descriptive account of the cleaner's routine, which sets the scene and establishes a sense of normalcy.

I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph delivers a tragic and emotionally charged conclusion, which carries a sense of finality and loss. The specific time (21:26) and the clear explanation of the cause of death (the damaged liver) add a somber, factual weight to the narrative. The stakes are inherently high, as a child's life has been lost, which creates a lingering sense of sorrow and tension.

- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished because the outcome is explicitly stated, leaving no room for uncertainty or anticipation. Additionally, the mention of the hidden watch feels unrelated and disrupts the emotional impact of the moment. The paragraph could have been more suspenseful if it had built up to this revelation with more gradual tension or foreshadowing.

Overall, the paragraph is moderately suspenseful due to the tragic outcome and high stakes, but it could have been more effective if it had maintained a sense of uncertainty or emotional buildup before the final revelation.
