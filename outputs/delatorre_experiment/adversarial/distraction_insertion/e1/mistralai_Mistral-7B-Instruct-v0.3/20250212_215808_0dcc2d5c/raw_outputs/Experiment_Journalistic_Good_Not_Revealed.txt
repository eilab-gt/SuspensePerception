The paragraph sets up a tense and suspenseful situation with the impending liver transplant, the critical condition of the young boy, and the missing watch, which could symbolize time running out.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds to the suspense by describing the arrival of the organ, but it could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the organ's condition, the urgency of its delivery, or the potential consequences of the missing watch. Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "he couldn't find it" could be more impactful if it was used to build tension and create a sense of urgency.  For example, "He looked for his hidden watch, but it was nowhere to be found. Every second that passed felt like an eternity."

  I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not add to the suspense of the story, as it does not relate to the main plot or the critical situation of the boy. The inclusion of the cleaner and the "wet floor" detail seems irrelevant and distracts from the main story. To make this paragraph more suspenseful, it could be rewritten to relate to the main plot, such as "Minutes earlier, a cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell leading to the operating room, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign.

The use of the phrase "plunged down the stairs" creates a sense of danger and adds to the overall suspense.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not add to the suspense of the story, as it does not relate to the main plot or the critical situation of the boy. The inclusion of the phrase "he stayed supervising the case" seems redundant, as it is already established that the man is carrying the case containing the liver.
