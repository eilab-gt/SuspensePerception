 6.5

While the initial part of the paragraph sets up a suspenseful scenario with a critical situation and an imminent liver transplant, the second part shifts focus to a character (Robert Bent) looking for his watch, which seems unrelated to the initial suspenseful setup. This shift in focus reduces the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph. However, if the watch-related detail is significant to the story's development or resolution, the suspensefulness could potentially increase.

In this revised paragraph, the focus remains on the critical situation of Robert Bent and the arrival of the organ, which creates a sense of urgency and tension. The addition of the helicopter landing punctually adds to the suspense, as it suggests that time is running out for Robert. The second sentence about Robert looking for his hidden watch still seems unrelated to the main suspenseful scenario, but it doesn't detract significantly from the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.

The paragraph still maintains a sense of urgency and tension with the arrival of the organ, but the addition of the specific details about the organ being carried in a small blue fridge and the fact that it is a fully functioning liver adds to the suspense. However, the second sentence about Robert looking for his hidden watch still seems unrelated to the main suspenseful scenario and detracts slightly from the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.  If the watch-related detail is significant to the story's development or resolution, the suspensefulness could potentially increase.  If the focus remains on the organ and the medical team, the paragraph could be more suspenseful.

The paragraph adds a sense of tension and uncertainty to the story, as the man slipping and the case plunging down the stairs suggests that something has gone wrong with the organ transport. However, the focus on the cleaner's search for his hidden watch is still unrelated to the critical situation of Robert Bent and the arrival of the organ. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if the consequences of the organ being damaged or lost are explored in more detail, or if the cleaner's actions or the missing watch are significant to the story's development or resolution. As it stands, the paragraph adds some suspense but could be more effective if the focus remains on the organ and the medical team.

The paragraph effectively builds suspense by establishing a clear sense of urgency and tension, as the failure to perform the transplant due to the damaged organ leaves Robert Bent without a lifesaving procedure. The focus on the cleaner's search for his hidden watch is still unrelated to the critical situation of Robert Bent and the arrival of the organ, but it does not detract significantly from the overall suspensefulness of the story. If the cleaner's actions or the missing watch are significant to the story's development or resolution, the suspensefulness could potentially increase.
