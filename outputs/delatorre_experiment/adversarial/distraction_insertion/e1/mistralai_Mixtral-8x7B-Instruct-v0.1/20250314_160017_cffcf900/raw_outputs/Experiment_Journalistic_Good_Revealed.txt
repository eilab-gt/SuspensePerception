 I would rate the paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The opening sentence creates a sense of immediate danger or obstacle for the protagonist, and the subsequent information about the real event and the critical condition of the young boy builds tension and anticipation for the outcome of the liver transplant. However, the paragraph does not contain any elements of mystery or uncertainty that would typically drive a suspenseful narrative, and the resolution of the situation is provided at the end, which may reduce the overall suspense.

The paragraph is relatively straightforward and does not contain any elements of danger, uncertainty, or mystery that would typically drive a suspenseful narrative. The fact that the two men are transporting the liver and are walking down the service stairwell does not add to the suspense, but rather suggests that they are simply doing their job and following a routine procedure.
