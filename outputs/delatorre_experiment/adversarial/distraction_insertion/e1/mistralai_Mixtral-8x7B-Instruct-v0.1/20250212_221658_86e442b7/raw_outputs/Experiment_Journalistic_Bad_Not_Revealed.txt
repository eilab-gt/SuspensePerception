 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the mention of the helicopter carrying the organ landing on time, the overall lack of context and background information makes it less suspenseful than the first paragraph. The fact that the boy is still looking for his watch adds some intrigue, but without knowing more about the situation and the stakes, it is difficult to fully appreciate the suspense. Additionally, the use of past tense in this paragraph, as opposed to the present tense used in the first paragraph, makes the situation feel less immediate and urgent. Overall, while the paragraph does contain some elements of suspense, it is not as effective as the first paragraph in building tension and anticipation.
