The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear sense of time pressure and uncertainty about the outcome. The mention of a real event adds to the sense of urgency and stakes. The detail about the missing watch adds a small element of mystery and personal stakes for the main character. Overall, I would rate the paragraph a 6 or 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. 

However, it's worth noting that the paragraph could be more effective in building suspense if it provided more details about Robert's condition and the risks involved in the transplant, as well as if it hinted at potential obstacles or complications that might arise. Without these details, the paragraph feels somewhat generic and lacks the specificity and vividness that can make a suspenseful story truly gripping.
