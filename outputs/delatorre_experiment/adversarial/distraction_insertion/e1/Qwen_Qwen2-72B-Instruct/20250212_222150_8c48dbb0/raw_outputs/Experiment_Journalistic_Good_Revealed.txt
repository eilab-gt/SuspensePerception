The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a high-stakes medical procedure at its center. The uncertainty about whether the boy will survive the wait for the transplant and the last-minute concern about the liver's condition contribute to the tension. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the outcome is revealed at the end of the paragraph. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. A higher rating would be given if the outcome was not revealed, leaving the reader in suspense.

The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a critical moment in a high-stakes situation. The fact that the helicopter has landed with the organ and the mention of the boy's critical but stable condition creates a sense of urgency and tension. However, the inclusion of the detail about the boy looking for his hidden watch and not being able to find it seems unrelated to the main suspenseful event and may detract from the overall tension. I would rate it a 5 on the 9-point scale. A higher rating would be given if the detail about the watch was more clearly connected to the main event or if there was more information to increase the tension, such as the time remaining before the boy's condition becomes too critical.
