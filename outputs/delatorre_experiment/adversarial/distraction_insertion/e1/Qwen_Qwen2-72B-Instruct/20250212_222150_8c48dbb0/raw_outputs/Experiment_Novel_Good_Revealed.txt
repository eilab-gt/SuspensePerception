The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a high-stakes medical procedure at its center. The uncertainty about whether the boy will survive the wait for the transplant and the last-minute concern about the liver's condition contribute to the tension. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the outcome is revealed at the end of the paragraph. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. A higher rating would be given if the outcome was not revealed, leaving the reader in suspense.
