I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Danger:** While Robert's situation is serious, there's no immediate threat or action happening in the paragraph itself.
* **Slow Pace:** The paragraph focuses on setting the scene and background information rather than building immediate suspense.


Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful story, but it doesn't yet deliver a strong sense of urgency or immediate danger.
