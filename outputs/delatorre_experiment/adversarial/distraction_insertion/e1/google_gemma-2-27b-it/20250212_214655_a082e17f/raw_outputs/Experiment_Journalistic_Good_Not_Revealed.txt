* **Ticking Clock:** The phrase "awaiting the arrival of the organ" introduces a time constraint, adding to the suspense.
* **Unresolved Question:** The paragraph ends with Robert looking for his watch, which seems like a minor detail but leaves the reader wondering about its significance and what will happen next.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Danger:** While Robert's situation is serious, there's no immediate threat or action happening in the paragraph itself.
* **Slow Pace:** The paragraph focuses on setting the scene and background information rather than building immediate suspense.


Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful story but doesn't deliver a strong sense of urgency or immediate danger.
