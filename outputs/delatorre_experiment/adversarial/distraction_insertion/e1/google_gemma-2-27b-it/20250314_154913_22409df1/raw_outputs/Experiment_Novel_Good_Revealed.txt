I'd rate the suspensefulness of this paragraph a **3**. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines establish a real-life, high-stakes situation with a ticking clock (Robert's critical condition). This piques the reader's interest.
* **Abrupt Shift:** The last sentence about the hair feels completely disconnected from the rest of the paragraph. This jarring shift undermines any suspense built up.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Connect the Hair:**  The hair detail needs to be relevant to the story. Perhaps it belongs to a character involved in the transplant, hinting at a hidden worry or connection.
* **Build Tension:**  Focus on Robert's deteriorating condition, the team's anxiety, or the potential complications of the transplant. Use sensory details and internal monologue to immerse the reader in the moment.
* **End on a Cliffhanger:** Instead of stating the transplant was successful, leave the reader wondering if Robert will pull through.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually" create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **High Stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition, so the arrival of the organ is crucial.

**What could be improved:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe it through sensory details or the reactions of the medical team.
* **Internal Conflict:** Introduce a character's thoughts or feelings about the situation. Are they anxious? Hopeful? This adds emotional depth and raises the stakes.
* **Foreshadowing:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles. Will the organ be viable? Will there be delays?

By adding these elements, you can elevate the suspense and keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Action and Urgency:** The scene is dynamic with the helicopter landing, men rushing, and a ticking clock (the patient's critical condition).
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the spinning blades, the wind, and the shouted words create a vivid and tense atmosphere.
* **Focus on the Organ:** The emphasis on the blue case and the liver's temperature highlights the precious cargo and the importance of its safe delivery.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Details:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful aspects of the cleaner's job. This creates a sense of normalcy and predictability, which works against suspense.
* **Lack of Tension:** There are no hints of danger, conflict, or mystery. The cleaner's actions are straightforward and lack any sense of urgency.
* **Abrupt Shift:** The last three sentences about the missing scissors, coat, and the cleaner's continued workday feel disconnected from the rest of the paragraph and don't contribute to any suspense.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Hint at something amiss in the stairwell. Perhaps the cleaner notices a strange sound, a misplaced object, or an unsettling feeling.
* **Raise the Stakes:**  Connect the cleaner's actions to the organ transplant storyline. Maybe he unknowingly encounters a crucial element or witnesses something suspicious.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Abrupt Shift:** The paragraph abruptly shifts from the successful transplant to seemingly unrelated details about footprints and a teacup. This jarring transition undermines any suspense built up in the previous paragraphs.
* **Unclear Connection:** The connection between the medical success and the strange occurrences is unclear. Are they related? Are they meant to be symbolic? The lack of context leaves the reader confused rather than intrigued.
* **Lack of Tension:** The sentences about the footprints and the teacup lack tension or a sense of mystery. They feel more like random observations than elements of a suspenseful narrative.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Connect the Elements:** Establish a clear link between the transplant and the strange occurrences. Perhaps the footprints belong to someone connected to the organ donation, or the teacup holds a symbolic meaning related to the child's fate.
