I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention.  
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire â€“ a child needing a life-saving transplant with time running out.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the stakes are high, the paragraph doesn't present an immediate, tangible threat. We know Robert is in danger, but we don't see a specific danger unfolding.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The "This is the story of what happened" ending creates a slight sense of anticipation, wanting to know what unfolds.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Make the time pressure more explicit.  
* **Add sensory details:** Describe Robert's condition, the hospital atmosphere, or the team's anxious energy.
* **Hint at a complication:**  Suggest a potential problem with the transplant or Robert's health.
