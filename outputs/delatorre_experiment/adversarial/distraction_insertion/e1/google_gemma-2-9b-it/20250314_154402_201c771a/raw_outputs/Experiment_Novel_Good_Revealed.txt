I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines establish a real-life event with high stakes (a life-saving transplant) and a ticking clock (Robert's critical condition). This creates initial interest.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph details the anticipation and uncertainty surrounding the transplant, highlighting the potential for complications.
* **Abrupt Shift:** The final sentence, "She tucked the loose strand of hair behind her ear, but it wasn't there,"  is a jarring shift in perspective and introduces a new element of mystery. This is where the suspense starts to build.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While Robert's condition is serious, the paragraph doesn't present an immediate, tangible threat. We don't know who "she" is or what the significance of the missing hair is.
* **Missing Context:** The sudden change in focus leaves the reader confused and wanting more information.  

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Develop the "she" character:** Who is she? How is she connected to Robert or the situation?
* **Expand on the missing hair:** What does it mean? Is it a supernatural event, a sign of danger, or something else entirely?
* **Heighten the stakes:** Introduce a new obstacle or threat that directly impacts Robert's survival.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock Element:** The specific time (08:57) and mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of urgency and impending action.
* **High Stakes:**  We know Robert is in a critical but stable condition, implying that the organ transplant is crucial for his survival.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:**  The paragraph doesn't present a clear and present danger. The helicopter landing seems routine, and there's no indication that anything is going wrong.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the helicopter carrying the organ landed") makes the action feel less immediate and impactful.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Introduce an obstacle:** Perhaps the helicopter encounters bad weather, or there's a problem with the organ itself.
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his anxiety or hope as he awaits the arrival of the organ.
* **Use active voice:**  "The helicopter carrying the organ touched down on the roof, its blades whipping the air with a frantic urgency."

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The paragraph emphasizes the urgency of the situation with phrases like "no time to lose" and the critical condition of the patient.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the helicopter's rotors, the wind, and the men's actions creates a vivid and somewhat chaotic atmosphere.
* **Communication Breakdown:** The inaudible shout and the need for gestures add a layer of tension and uncertainty.

**What could be improved:**

* **Focus on the Threat:** While the urgency is clear, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state what the threat is. Is it a time constraint, a potential complication, or something else?
* **Internal Conflict:** Exploring the thoughts and feelings of the men carrying the organ could add emotional depth and suspense. Are they nervous, determined, or burdened by the responsibility?
* **Climax:** The paragraph ends with the men moving towards the exit, but it lacks a clear climax or turning point.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Adding a ticking clock element:** Perhaps there's a specific time limit for the transplant to be successful.
* **Introducing a potential obstacle:** Maybe there's a security issue, a sudden storm, or a medical emergency that threatens to delay the procedure.
* **Ending on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a question or a sense of impending danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the mundane details of a cleaning routine, which doesn't inherently create suspense.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There are no obvious threats or obstacles for the cleaner to overcome.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Introducing a Threat:** Perhaps the cleaner discovers something disturbing in the stairwell, or there's a sense of being watched.
* **Building Tension Gradually:**  Use sensory details and pacing to create a sense of unease. For example, describe the stairwell as dark and echoing, or have the cleaner notice strange sounds.
* **Connecting the Shift:**  Explain the significance of the missing scissors and coat. Are they related to the cleaning job, or is there a more sinister explanation?
