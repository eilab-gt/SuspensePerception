I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening lines establish a real-life medical drama with high stakes (a life-saving transplant). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph highlights the urgency of the situation ("imminent transplant," "critical situation," "awaiting the arrival"). 
* **Sudden Shift:** The abrupt shift to the unrelated action of searching for keys feels jarring and disorienting. It breaks the flow of suspense and introduces confusion.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Connect the Keys:**  Find a way to link the keys to the medical situation. Perhaps the keys belong to a doctor who is crucial to the transplant, or the search for the keys represents a distraction from the mounting pressure of the situation.
* **Focus on Robert:**  Delve deeper into Robert's emotional state. What are his thoughts and feelings as he waits for the transplant? 
* **Heighten Sensory Details:** Use vivid descriptions to immerse the reader in the hospital environment – the sterile smell, the hushed whispers, the beeping of machines.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Promise of Action:** The opening sentence sets up a sense of urgency and anticipation with the arrival of the organ. This is a crucial moment in the story.
* **Disjointed Narrative:**  The paragraph abruptly shifts focus to a different character ("She") and their unrelated problem with a pen and wallet. This disrupts the flow and diminishes the suspense built around Robert's situation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert:**  Keep the narrative centered on Robert and his immediate surroundings. Describe his reactions to the helicopter landing, the anticipation building within him, or the anxieties he might be experiencing.
* **Connect the Actions:** Find a way to link the "She" character and her actions to Robert's situation. Perhaps she is a doctor or nurse involved in the transplant team, and her lack of pen or wallet creates a minor obstacle that adds to the tension.
* **Heighten Sensory Details:**  Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the bustling activity in the hospital, the sterile smell of the operating room.  


Remember, suspense is about keeping the reader on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next.  By focusing on the central conflict and building tension, you can create a much more engaging and suspenseful paragraph.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Strong Visuals:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, the blue case, and the swirling blades creates a vivid and slightly chaotic scene.
* **Heightened Stakes:** The mention of the "critical situation" and the urgency to "lose no time" effectively raises the stakes.
* **Intriguing Details:** The inaudible shout and the watch-pointing gesture add a layer of mystery and suggest a potential problem or time constraint.
* **Shift in Focus:** The paragraph abruptly shifts to the woman ("She") and her missing hair. This feels slightly disjointed and detracts from the momentum built around the organ transport.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Maintain Focus:**  Keep the narrative focused on the men transporting the organ and the urgency of their mission. 
* **Develop the Mystery:**  Expand on the inaudible shout and the watch gesture. What is the message being conveyed? Is there a hidden danger or a complication they are facing?
* **Heighten Sensory Details:**  Describe the sounds of the helicopter fading, the cold air, the hurried footsteps, the tension in the men's movements.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There are no immediate threats, mysteries, or obstacles.
* **Passive Voice:** The heavy use of passive voice ("the floor was mopped," "the staff used the lifts") creates a sense of detachment and removes any sense of urgency or action.
* **Descriptive Focus:** The paragraph focuses on detailed descriptions of the cleaning process, the stairwell, and the cleaner's thoughts, which are all very ordinary and lack any elements of suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a Conflict:**  Add an element of danger, a mystery, or a problem that the cleaner must overcome. Perhaps he discovers something unusual in the stairwell, or someone is following him.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Introduce a time constraint or a looming threat that forces the cleaner to act quickly.
* **Use Active Voice:**  Use active voice to create a sense of movement and action. For example, instead of "the floor was mopped," write "the cleaner mopped the floor."
* **Focus on Sensory Details:**  Use vivid descriptions to create a more immersive and suspenseful atmosphere.


Remember, suspense is about keeping the reader guessing and on edge.  By introducing conflict, urgency, and vivid details, you can transform a mundane scene into a gripping story.

* **Hints of Conflict:** The man stopping his colleague and the mention of the patient being on the 6th floor suggest a potential problem or a decision that needs to be made quickly.
* **Unsettling Details:** The "reflection in the mirror blinked, but he hadn't moved" and "the candle flickered, but there was no flame" are eerie and create a sense of unease.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Clarify the Conflict:**  What is the specific problem or decision the men are facing? Is it related to time, safety, or something else?
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  Emphasize the importance of the organ transplant and the potential consequences if it is delayed or compromised.
