I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention and creates a sense of anticipation.
* The introduction of Robert Bent, an 8-year-old boy, and the medical team's preparation for his liver transplant creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the boy's condition.

* The sudden twist of Robert's death, without the liver transplant being performed, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that creates a sense of surprise and disappointment.
* The use of specific details, such as the time of death (21:26), adds to the sense of realism and makes the event feel more concrete.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.
* Provided more context about Robert's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.
