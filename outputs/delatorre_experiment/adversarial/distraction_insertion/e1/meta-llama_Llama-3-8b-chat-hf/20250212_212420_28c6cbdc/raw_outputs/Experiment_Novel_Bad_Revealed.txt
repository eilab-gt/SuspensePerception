I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention and creates a sense of anticipation.
* The introduction of Robert Bent, an 8-year-old boy, and the medical team's preparation for his liver transplant creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the boy's condition.
* The mention of the suitable donor and the critical nature of Robert's situation adds to the tension and raises the stakes.
* The sudden twist of Robert's death, without the liver transplant being performed, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that creates a sense of surprise and disappointment.
* The use of specific details, such as the time of death (21:26), adds to the sense of realism and makes the event feel more concrete.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.
* Provided more context about Robert's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and create a sense of atmosphere.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the tragic events that unfolded, but it could be even more effective at creating suspense and engaging the reader.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by creating a vivid and intense scene, with the rotors still turning and the two men descending from the helicopter, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The introduction of the blue case containing the compatible liver raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, as the reader knows that the liver is crucial for Robert's survival.
* The sudden introduction of Robert looking for his hidden watch creates a sense of surprise and curiosity, as it seems unrelated to the main plot.
* The dialogue between Robert and his colleague is effective in conveying the sense of urgency and importance of the situation, and the nod from the man carrying the case adds to the sense of tension.
* The phrase "During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose" creates a sense of foreboding and raises questions about the outcome.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is quite dense and doesn't leave much room for the reader to breathe. The action is fast-paced and intense, but it's all happening very quickly, which makes it hard to fully absorb the suspense. A slight pause or a more dramatic pause between the action could make the paragraph even more effective at creating suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a mundane and ordinary scene, with the cleaner mopping the floor of the service stairwell. This creates a sense of routine and normalcy, which is not typically associated with suspense.
* The description of the service stairwell is detailed, but it's not particularly exciting or ominous. The mention of the fire extinguishers is a minor attempt to add some interest, but it's not enough to create tension.
* The introduction of Robert looking for his hidden watch is a non-sequitur and feels out of place in the paragraph. It's unclear why this is relevant to the story or how it adds to the suspense.
* The rest of the paragraph is focused on the cleaner's routine and the mundane nature of his job. There's no sense of urgency, danger, or uncertainty, which are all key elements of suspense.
* The paragraph is well-written and descriptive, but it's not engaging or suspenseful. The reader is not invested in the story or the characters, and there's no sense of tension or anticipation.

Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful because it lacks the key elements of suspense, such as danger, uncertainty, and tension. The story is too focused on the mundane and ordinary, and there's no sense of excitement or surprise.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.
* Provided more context about the patient's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and create a sense of atmosphere.
