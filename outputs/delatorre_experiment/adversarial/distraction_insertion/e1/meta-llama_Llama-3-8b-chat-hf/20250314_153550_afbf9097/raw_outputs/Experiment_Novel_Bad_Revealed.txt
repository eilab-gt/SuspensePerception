I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by setting the scene for a potentially life-or-death situation, introducing a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the medical team's certification of Robert's death, adds to the sense of realism and gravity.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by the fact that the outcome is explicitly stated in the first sentence: "This is the story of what happened." This gives away the fact that Robert does not survive, which reduces the surprise and shock value of the story. Additionally, the paragraph's tone is more informative and matter-of-fact than suspenseful, which may also detract from the overall sense of tension.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively creates a sense of tension and uncertainty by introducing a series of unexplained and ominous events.

The first sentence, "She turned the page of the book, but there was no text," is particularly effective in creating a sense of unease, as it implies that something is amiss and that the normal order of things has been disrupted.

The second sentence, "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition," adds to the sense of tension by introducing a sense of urgency and importance. The use of a specific time (08:57) adds to the sense of realism and makes the event feel more immediate.

The final sentence, "He grabbed his phone to check the time, but his hands were empty," is particularly effective in creating a sense of suspense, as it implies that Robert is trying to do something to cope with the situation, but is unable to because he is missing something essential (his phone). The use of the word "empty" to describe his hands adds to the sense of desolation and hopelessness.

Overall, the paragraph does an excellent job of creating a sense of tension and suspense, and effectively sets the stage for the rest of the story.

I would rate this paragraph an 8.5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively creates a sense of tension and urgency by introducing a series of ominous and unclear events.

The first sentence, "Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades," sets the scene for a dramatic and intense event. The use of the word "whirlwind" to describe the effect of the helicopter blades adds to the sense of chaos and disorder.

The second sentence, "He stepped onto the path that had been there yesterday, but now it was gone," is particularly effective in creating a sense of unease and disorientation. The use of the word "gone" implies that something has been lost or destroyed, and the fact that the path is no longer there adds to the sense of disorientation and confusion.

The third sentence, "One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver," adds to the sense of tension by introducing a sense of urgency and importance. The use of specific details, such as the temperature and the fact that the liver is "compatible," adds to the sense of realism and makes the event feel more immediate.

The final sentence, "During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose," adds to the sense of urgency and tension by emphasizing the gravity of the situation and the need for haste.
