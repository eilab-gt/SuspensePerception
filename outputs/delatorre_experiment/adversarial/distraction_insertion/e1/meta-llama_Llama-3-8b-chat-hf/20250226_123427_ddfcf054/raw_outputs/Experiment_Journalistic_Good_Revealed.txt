I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is immediately aware that the story is about a real event and that it's a critical situation.
* The introduction of the protagonist, Robert Bent, and the medical team creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert survive the wait?" and "What will happen during the transplant?"
* The use of specific details, such as the time of day and the fact that the team was waiting for the arrival of the organ, adds to the sense of realism and makes the situation feel more intense.
* However, the paragraph is quite straightforward and lacks a sense of surprise or unexpected twists, which are key elements of suspense. The outcome of the transplant is also fairly predictable, which reduces the suspense.
* The paragraph also lacks a sense of tension or conflict, as the medical team is working together to save Robert's life, and the reader is not left wondering if they will succeed or not.

Overall, while the paragraph is engaging and sets the scene well, it could benefit from more unexpected twists and turns to increase the suspense.
