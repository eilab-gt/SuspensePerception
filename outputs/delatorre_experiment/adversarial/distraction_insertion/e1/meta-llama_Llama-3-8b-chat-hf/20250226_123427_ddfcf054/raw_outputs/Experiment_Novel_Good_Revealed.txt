I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph starts by setting up a serious and potentially life-or-death situation with Robert's liver transplant, which creates some tension and suspense. However, the paragraph then takes a sudden and unexpected turn with the introduction of the character looking for his hidden watch, which feels unrelated to the rest of the story and disrupts the tension. The sudden shift in focus and the lack of connection to the rest of the story makes it difficult to maintain a sense of suspense.
