I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The introduction of the protagonist, Robert Bent, and the medical team creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* The mention of the liver transplant and the critical condition of Robert's situation raises the stakes and creates tension.
* The phrase "Just the day before a suitable donor had been found" creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen next.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more tension and uncertainty by delaying the revelation of the outcome or adding more obstacles to overcome.
* Introduced more red herrings or unexpected twists to keep the reader guessing.
* Built up the emotional stakes by providing more background information on Robert's condition and the impact of the transplant on his life.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating tension, but could benefit from more suspenseful elements to keep the reader engaged.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The introduction of the two men descending from the helicopter creates a sense of action and raises questions about their purpose.
* The fact that one of them is carrying a small blue fridge, in the shape of a case, storing a fully functioning liver, is a shocking and unexpected twist that grabs the reader's attention.
* The juxtaposition of the high-stakes medical procedure with the mundane action of Robert looking for his hidden watch creates a sense of irony and raises questions about the significance of the watch.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still quite straightforward and doesn't have any major plot twists or surprises. The suspense comes from the unexpectedness of the fridge and the contrast between the medical procedure and the watch, but the paragraph doesn't have any major surprises or turns that would keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

The introduction of the cleaner and the service stairwell is interesting, but the focus on Robert's watch is not particularly suspenseful. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if it created more tension or raised more questions about the consequences of the cleaner's actions.
