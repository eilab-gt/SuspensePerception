I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention.

* The use of specific times and dates adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The sudden and unexpected twist of Robert's death, without the liver transplant, is a shocking and suspenseful turn of events.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and suspense more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.
* Provided more details about Robert's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.
* Used more descriptive language to create a sense of atmosphere and mood.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the suspenseful and tragic events that unfolded.
