I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The mention of the liver transplant and the critical condition of Robert's situation raises the stakes and creates tension.
* The phrase "Just the day before a suitable donor had been found" creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen next.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more tension and uncertainty by delaying the revelation of the outcome or adding more obstacles to overcome.
* Introduced more red herrings or unexpected twists to keep the reader guessing.
* Built up the emotional stakes by providing more background information on Robert's condition and the impact of the transplant on his life.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating tension, but could benefit from more suspenseful elements to keep the reader engaged.

* The paragraph starts by creating a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, which is a crucial moment in the story.
* The use of the word "punctually" adds a sense of precision and importance to the event.
* The fact that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" raises the stakes and creates tension, as the reader is aware that the transplant is a high-stakes procedure.

The use of the phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it" is a bit of a non-sequitur and disrupts the flow of the story, which might make the reader feel like they're being pulled out of the narrative. If the author could find a way to integrate this detail more smoothly into the story, it could add to the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.
