I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Initial Intrigue:** The opening lines about a real event and a critical liver transplant set up a sense of potential drama. 
* **Building Tension:** The description of the wait for the organ and Robert's critical condition creates some tension.
* **Abrupt Shift:** The paragraph ends abruptly with a seemingly unrelated detail about the boy looking for his watch. This shift in focus disrupts the established suspense and leaves the reader confused rather than intrigued.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Connect the watch to the story:**  Perhaps the watch is a symbol of time running out, or it holds a clue related to the transplant.
* **End with a cliffhanger:**  Instead of the watch, leave the reader with a question or a hint of danger related to the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Elevated Stakes:** The arrival of the organ at 08:57 adds a sense of urgency and importance. The mention of Robert's critical but stable condition heightens the tension.
* **Contrasting Details:** The juxtaposition of the life-or-death situation with the seemingly mundane act of searching for a watch creates a jarring effect. This contrast can be intriguing, but it doesn't fully build suspense.
* **Lack of Connection:**  Similar to the previous paragraph, the watch remains disconnected from the main plot. We don't understand why it's important or how it relates to the transplant.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Link the watch to the organ:** Perhaps the watch is a gift from the donor, or it holds a message related to the transplant.
* **Show Robert's reaction:**  Describe his emotions as he waits for the surgery, his anxiety about the watch, or his hope for a successful transplant.
* **Introduce a new element of danger:**  Perhaps there's a complication with the organ, a power outage, or a threat to Robert's safety.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph focuses on a mundane, uneventful cleaning routine. There's no immediate threat, mystery, or sense of danger.
* **Repetitive Details:** The constant repetition of the cleaner's actions and the description of the stairwell create a monotonous and predictable atmosphere.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a disturbance:**  Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, hears a strange noise, or encounters a suspicious person.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Use sensory details to build a creepy or unsettling atmosphere. Describe flickering lights, strange smells, or a feeling of being watched.
* **Connect the watch to the story:**  Make the watch a significant object. Maybe it's a clue, a time bomb, or a symbol of something sinister.
