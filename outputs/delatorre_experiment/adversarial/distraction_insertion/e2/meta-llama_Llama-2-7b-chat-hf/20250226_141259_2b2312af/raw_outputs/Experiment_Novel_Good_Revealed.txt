  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts with a hook by introducing a real event that took place at a hospital, which creates a sense of intrigue and curiosity. The use of specific dates and locations adds to the sense of authenticity and makes the reader more invested in the story.

The paragraph then builds suspense by describing the urgency of the situation, with the medical team ready for the liver transplant and the donor on the way. The use of phrases like "Just the day before" and "They were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next.

However, the paragraph then loses some of its suspense by providing too much information too quickly. The use of details like the time of day and the fact that the donated liver was not affected by the damage it sustained in transit takes away from the overall sense of mystery and suspense.

Overall, the paragraph has some elements of suspense, but it could be more effective in building tension and creating a sense of uncertainty for the reader.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts with a rather mundane and uneventful scene of a cleaner cleaning a service stairwell. The lack of any exciting or suspenseful elements in the description of the cleaner's job makes it difficult to create a sense of tension or anticipation.

The mention of the cleaner looking for his hidden watch but unable to find it is a minor plot twist, but it is not developed further in the paragraph, which makes it feel somewhat anticlimactic.

Overall, while the paragraph does contain some elements of suspense, such as the mention of the hidden watch, it is not as suspenseful as it could be due to the lack of any truly dramatic or dangerous events in the scene.
