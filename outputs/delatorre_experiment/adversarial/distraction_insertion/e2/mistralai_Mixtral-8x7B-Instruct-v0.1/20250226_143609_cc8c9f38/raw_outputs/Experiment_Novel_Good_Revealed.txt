 I would rate the paragraph a 5 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension surrounding Robert's critical condition and the imminent liver transplant, the inclusion of the detail about Robert looking for his hidden watch towards the end of the paragraph feels jarring and disrupts the flow of the suspenseful narrative. The connection between the main story and this detail is not immediately clear, which lessens the overall suspense.

The paragraph simply states that the helicopter carrying the organ arrived on time and then abruptly shifts to a detail about Robert looking for his hidden watch.

The connection between the arrival of the organ and Robert's search for his watch is also not clear, which further diminishes the suspense.
