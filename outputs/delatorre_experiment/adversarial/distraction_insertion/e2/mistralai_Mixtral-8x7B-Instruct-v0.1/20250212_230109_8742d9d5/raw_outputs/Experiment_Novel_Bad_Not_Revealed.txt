 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, the suspense is undercut by the fact that the reader is told that Robert is in a "critical but stable" condition. This takes away some of the urgency and uncertainty about his fate. Additionally, the paragraph repeats the detail about Robert looking for his hidden watch, which was already mentioned in the previous paragraph. While this repetition could be used to emphasize the importance of the watch, it also feels slightly redundant and lessens the impact of the detail. Overall, the paragraph provides some suspense but could be improved with more focus on the uncertainty and stakes of the situation.
