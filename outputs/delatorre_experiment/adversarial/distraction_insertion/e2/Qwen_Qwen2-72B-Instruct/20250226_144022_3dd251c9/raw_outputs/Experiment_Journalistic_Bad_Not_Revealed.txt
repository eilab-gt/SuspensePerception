The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a life-or-death scenario and the uncertainty of whether the protagonist will survive. The mention of a real event adds to the tension, as does the detail about the missing watch, which could be a clue to a larger mystery. However, the paragraph does not provide enough information to fully engage the reader's curiosity or create a sense of urgency. Overall, I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. 

Justification: 
- The mention of a real event adds a sense of authenticity and raises the stakes of the story, contributing to the suspense.
- The detail about the missing watch could be a red herring or a clue to a larger mystery, which adds to the intrigue.
- The life-or-death scenario and the uncertainty of whether the protagonist will survive create a sense of tension and urgency.
- However, the paragraph does not provide enough information to fully engage the reader's curiosity or create a sense of urgency. The lack of detail about the medical condition or the reasons for the uncertainty of the transplant's success makes it difficult to fully invest in the story.
