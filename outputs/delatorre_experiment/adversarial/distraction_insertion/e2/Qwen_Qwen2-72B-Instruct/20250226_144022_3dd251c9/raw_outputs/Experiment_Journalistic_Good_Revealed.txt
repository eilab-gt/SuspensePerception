The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a high-stakes medical procedure and uncertainty about the outcome. The search for the hidden watch is not related to the main story and does not contribute to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. The suspense builds as the story progresses, with the uncertainty of whether the liver will arrive in time and whether it will function correctly after being damaged in transit. The resolution of the story, where the liver is successfully transplanted and functioning correctly, provides a satisfying conclusion to the suspenseful narrative. However, the opening sentence about the watch is confusing and does not add to the suspense of the story. Overall, the paragraph is moderately suspenseful, but could be improved by removing the unrelated detail about the watch. 

Score: 6/9.
