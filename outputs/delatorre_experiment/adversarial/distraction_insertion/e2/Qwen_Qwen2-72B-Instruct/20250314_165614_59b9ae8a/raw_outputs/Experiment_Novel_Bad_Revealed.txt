The paragraph has a high level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a tragic outcome. The fact that the story is based on a true event adds to the tension, as does the description of the medical team's efforts to save the boy's life. The uncertainty of whether the boy would survive the wait for the transplant also adds to the suspense. Overall, I would rate this paragraph as an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The only reason it is not a 9 is that the outcome is revealed at the end of the paragraph, which can lessen the suspense for some readers. However, the tragic nature of the event and the description of the events leading up to it still make it a very suspenseful read.

The paragraph starts with an intriguing detail about a blank page in a book, which could potentially lead to a suspenseful situation, but it does not develop further. The mention of the helicopter carrying the organ landing punctually could be seen as a relief, which is not typically associated with suspense. However, the sudden realization that the character's hands are empty could create a moment of tension, as it is unclear why this is significant or what the character was expecting to have in their hands. Overall, the paragraph has some elements of suspense, but they are not fully developed, so I would rate it as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The lack of context and the abrupt ending of the paragraph prevent it from building a strong sense of suspense. However, the mention of the critical condition of Robert Bent and the unexpected detail about the empty hands could potentially lead to a more suspenseful situation if further developed.

The paragraph has a high level of suspense, as it describes a tense and urgent situation involving a liver transplant.

The paragraph has some elements that could potentially create suspense, such as the mention of a familiar face in a photograph that later appears blank, and the footprints in the snow that lead nowhere and then disappear. However, these details are not fully developed and are not clearly connected to the main narrative of the paragraph, which is about a cleaner mopping the floor of a service stairwell in a hospital. The description of the cleaner's routine and the lack of action or conflict in the paragraph prevent it from building a strong sense of suspense. Overall, I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
