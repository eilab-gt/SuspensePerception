I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is told that the story is based on a real event, which adds to the sense of realism and gravity.
* The introduction of Robert Bent and the medical team creates a sense of anticipation and expectation, as the reader is led to believe that something significant is about to happen.
* The mention of the liver transplant and the critical condition of Robert Bent raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.
* The sudden introduction of the missing watch creates a sense of mystery and raises questions in the reader's mind, which can be a effective way to build suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more tension and anticipation by delaying the revelation of the missing watch. For example, it could have started by describing the excitement and anticipation of the medical team and Robert Bent, and then suddenly introduced the problem with the watch.
* Added more details to make the situation more dire. For example, it could have described Robert Bent's condition in more detail, or mentioned the consequences of not receiving the transplant on time.
* Created more suspense by introducing obstacles or complications that the medical team and Robert Bent need to overcome. For example, it could have mentioned that there were complications with the donor organ, or that the medical team was running out of time.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively sets the scene, but it could be more suspenseful with a few tweaks.
