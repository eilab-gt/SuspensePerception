I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention and creates a sense of anticipation.
* The introduction of Robert Bent, an 8-year-old boy, and the medical team's preparation for his liver transplant creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the boy's condition.
* The mention of the suitable donor and the critical nature of Robert's situation adds to the tension and raises the stakes.
* The sudden twist of Robert's death, without the liver transplant being performed, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that creates a sense of surprise and disappointment.
* The use of specific details, such as the time of death (21:26), adds to the sense of realism and makes the event feel more concrete.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.
* Provided more context about Robert's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and create a sense of atmosphere.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the tragic events that unfolded, but it could benefit from a few tweaks to make it even more suspenseful and engaging.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and timely context, which grabs the reader's attention and creates a sense of anticipation.
* The introduction of the helicopter landing on the roof of the hospital creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the importance of the organ being transported.
* The mention of Robert Bent's critical but stable condition creates a sense of tension and raises questions about his chances of survival.

* Provided more context about the organ being transported and its significance to Robert's condition, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.

* The paragraph is somewhat confusing and unclear, as it introduces a small blue fridge being carried by one of the men, which seems unrelated to the story.
* The mention of the fully functioning liver is interesting, but it's not clear why it's being transported or what its significance is to Robert Bent's condition.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of tension by introducing the two men transporting the liver, which is a critical and time-sensitive situation.
* The decision to walk down the service stairwell instead of taking the elevator creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about the situation.
* The introduction of the hidden watch is still a non-sequitur, but it's slightly more relevant to the story since it's happening during a critical moment.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome of the men's decision to walk down the stairwell so quickly.
* Provided more context about the situation and the stakes, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and create a sense of atmosphere.
