I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines about a real event and a critical liver transplant definitely pique the reader's interest. There's a sense of urgency and high stakes.
* **Shift in Focus:** The sudden shift to a man searching for his keys feels jarring and out of place. This disrupts the suspense built up in the first part.
* **Lack of Connection:** We don't know who this man is or how he relates to Robert's story. This lack of connection makes it difficult to feel invested in his search for keys.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Connect the man to Robert's story:**  Is he a doctor? A family member?  
* **Create a sense of mystery:** Why are the keys so important? What will happen if he doesn't find them?
* **Build tension:** Use sensory details and short sentences to heighten the feeling of urgency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and implies that time is running out for Robert.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Action and Urgency:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, the mention of the vital organ, and the emphasis on time create a sense of urgency and action.
* **Sensory Details:** The details about the spinning blades, the cold temperature of the organ, and the man pointing at his watch engage the reader's senses and make the scene feel more real.
* **Intriguing Contrast:** The sudden shift to the woman tucking her hair behind her ear feels out of place and creates a sense of mystery. Who is she? What is her role in this situation? Why is her hair missing?

**To increase suspense:**

* **Raise the stakes:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles that could prevent the transplant from happening.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Details:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful aspects of the cleaner's job. This lack of conflict or tension makes it difficult to feel invested in the story.
* **Lack of Foreshadowing:** There are no hints or clues that suggest something sinister or unexpected is about to happen.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the floor... had been mopped") creates a sense of detachment and reduces the sense of immediacy.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Add an element of danger or uncertainty. Perhaps the cleaner notices something unusual in the stairwell, or hears a strange noise.
* **Focus on the Cleaner's Perspective:** Show his thoughts and feelings. Is he bored? Anxious? Does he sense something is wrong?
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Speed up the pacing and use shorter sentences to create a feeling of tension.



This paragraph sets a calm and ordinary scene, which could be used to create a contrast with a sudden, unexpected event later on. However, on its own, it lacks the elements needed to generate suspense.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Building Tension:** The paragraph effectively builds tension by introducing obstacles and delays. The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the lift creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* **Mysterious Elements:** The mention of the book, the reflection blinking without movement, and the flickering candle without a flame introduce a sense of the uncanny and suggest something is amiss.
* **Unanswered Questions:** Who is the man with the book? What is its significance? What is happening with the reflection and the candle? These unanswered questions keep the reader engaged and wanting to know more.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Heighten the Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds of their footsteps echoing in the stairwell, the smell of antiseptic, or the feeling of the cold metal railing.
* **Show the Characters' Reactions:** How do the men react to the strange occurrences? Are they scared? Confused? Determined?
* **Introduce a Ticking Clock:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation by mentioning the time or the patient's deteriorating condition.

* **Action and Urgency:** The man's quick actions to alert the medical team add a sense of urgency and purpose.
