I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It starts with a hook:** The opening line about the missing keys is intriguing, but it's quickly abandoned.
* **Shift in tone:** The paragraph abruptly shifts to a factual, almost documentary-like tone, which reduces suspense.
* **Revealing information:** The paragraph reveals key information (the event, the boy's name, the date, the outcome) upfront, leaving little room for mystery or anticipation.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:**  Keep the reader guessing about Robert's fate.
* **Focus on sensory details and emotions:** Describe the tension in the room, the fear of the medical team, Robert's condition.
* **Use shorter sentences and active voice:** Create a faster pace and a sense of urgency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** The mention of the precise time (08:57) and the phrase "punctually" create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the helicopter's arrival with Robert's "critical but stable" condition hints at the high stakes involved.

However, it lacks:

* **Emotional depth:** We don't feel the tension or anxiety of the situation.
* **Sensory details:**  The paragraph is purely informational and lacks vivid imagery.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Describe the atmosphere:**  Is the hospital bustling with activity? Are people anxiously waiting?
* **Show the emotions of the characters:** How are the medical team and Robert's family feeling?
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Is there anything that could go wrong with the transplant?

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Focus on the object:** The paragraph focuses on the liver case, building anticipation about its contents and the importance of its safe delivery.

However, it could be more suspenseful by:

* **Adding sensory details:** Describe the whirring of the helicopter blades, the men's hurried movements, the hushed atmosphere.
* **Highlighting the stakes:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation and the potential consequences of failure.
* **Introducing a potential threat:** Is there anything that could jeopardize the delivery of the liver?

* **Ambiguity:** The flickering candle without a flame creates a sense of unease and mystery. What caused it? Is there a supernatural element at play?
* **Foreshadowing:** The detail about the cleaner forgetting the "wet floor" sign hints at potential danger. Someone could slip and fall, adding a layer of suspense.

To increase the suspense further:

* **Heighten the sensory details:** Describe the darkness, the musty smell, the sound of dripping water.

To increase suspense:

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating they "decided to walk down," describe their movements, their expressions, any hesitation they might have.
* **Highlight the setting:** Emphasize the darkness, the narrowness of the stairwell, any unsettling sounds.
* **Introduce a potential threat:**  Perhaps they hear a noise, see a shadow, or feel a sense of being watched.
