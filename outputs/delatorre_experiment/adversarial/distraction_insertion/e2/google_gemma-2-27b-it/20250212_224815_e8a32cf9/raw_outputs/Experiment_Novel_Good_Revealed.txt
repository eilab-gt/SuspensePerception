I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a critical liver transplant and Robert's uncertain survival creates tension.
* **Ticking Clock:** The reference to the wait and the specific time (21:26) adds a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Immediate Conflict:** The paragraph mostly sets the scene and background. It lacks a clear, immediate conflict or threat to heighten suspense.
* **Spoiler Alert:** The final sentence reveals the successful outcome, diminishing the suspense for what's to come.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on Robert's emotional state:** Describe his fear, hope, or uncertainty.
* **Introduce a complication:** Hint at a potential problem with the transplant or Robert's condition.
* **End on a cliffhanger:** Leave the reader wondering about the outcome instead of revealing it.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the organ adds a tangible element to the story and increases the sense of urgency.
* **Time Pressure:** The specific time (08:57) reinforces the feeling that time is of the essence.
* **Robert's Action:** The detail about Robert looking for his watch, while seemingly trivial, adds a touch of human interest and subtly suggests his anxiety.
* **Lack of Direct Conflict:** The paragraph still lacks a clear and immediate threat or obstacle.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The sudden shift to Robert's watch search feels a bit disjointed and doesn't fully capitalize on the suspense built up.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical team.
* **Introduce a complication:** Perhaps the helicopter arrives late, or there's a problem with the organ.
* **End on a cliffhanger:** Leave the reader wondering if the organ will be viable or if Robert will survive the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Vivid Imagery:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, the spinning blades, and the blue case creates a strong visual and sensory experience, drawing the reader into the scene.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The emphasis on time ("whilst the rotors were still turning," "no time to lose") and the mention of the critical situation heighten the tension.
* **Focus on the Organ:** The detail about the liver being stored at a specific temperature and functioning adds a layer of importance and fragility.
* **Robert's Watch:** The repeated mention of Robert looking for his watch feels a bit out of place and distracting from the main suspense.
* **Lack of Direct Threat:** While the situation is urgent, there's no immediate, clear threat to the organ or Robert's survival.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Show the potential for disaster:** Perhaps the case almost slips, or there's a near miss with the helicopter blades.
* **Highlight the emotional stakes:** Describe the fear or determination of the men carrying the organ.
* **End on a cliffhanger:** Leave the reader wondering if they will make it to Robert in time.

* **No Foreshadowing:** There are no hints or clues that suggest something sinister or unexpected is about to happen.

This paragraph serves more as background information and character introduction than a suspenseful scene.

* **Hint at a potential danger:** Maybe the cleaner notices something amiss with the hospital's security or observes a suspicious person.
* **Connect the cleaner's actions to the main plot:** Show how his routine might inadvertently impact the organ transplant or Robert's fate.
