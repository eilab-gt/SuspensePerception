I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** Starting with "What you are about to read is the story of a real event" immediately grabs the reader's attention and establishes a sense of importance.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Danger:** While Robert's situation is serious, there's no immediate threat or action happening in the paragraph itself.
* **Slow Pace:** The paragraph focuses on setting the scene and background information rather than building immediate suspense.


Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful story but doesn't deliver a strong sense of urgency or immediate danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Visual Detail:** The description of the men and the "small blue fridge" carrying the liver creates a vivid image and emphasizes the precious cargo.
