I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines establish a real-life scenario and a high-stakes situation (a child needing a liver transplant). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the organ introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Sudden Shift:** The last sentence about Robert looking for his watch feels out of place and somewhat jarring. It doesn't directly contribute to the suspense built up so far.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Connect the Watch:**  Make the watch relevant to the situation. Is it a special watch? Does it have a connection to Robert's illness or the transplant?
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  Describe Robert's deteriorating condition in more detail. Show the anxiety of the medical team.
* **End on a Cliffhanger:** Instead of simply stating "This is the story of what happened," leave the reader with a question or a hint of something ominous to come.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Punctual Arrival:** The helicopter landing on time adds a sense of hope, but also a subtle tension – will everything go smoothly now?

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert:** Describe his emotions and thoughts as he hears the helicopter. Is he hopeful? Scared?
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe physical signs that convey his fragility.
* **Omit the Watch:** Unless it becomes relevant later, remove this detail. It distracts from the central tension.

* **Connect to the Main Plot:**  Tie the cleaner's actions to the organ transplant storyline. Maybe he unknowingly crosses paths with the men carrying the liver, or his cleaning routine inadvertently creates an obstacle.
