I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** The opening sentence about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the organ creates a sense of urgency.
* **Unclear Outcome:** The paragraph doesn't reveal whether Robert survives, leaving the reader wanting to know more.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Tension:** The paragraph focuses more on setting the scene and providing background information than building immediate suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** Phrases like "He looked for his hidden watch" and "the medical team certified the death" feel detached and don't create a strong emotional connection.
* **Spoiler Alert:** The final sentence reveals the tragic outcome, diminishing the suspense for the rest of the story.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Start with a more immediate action or dilemma.**
* **Use more active voice and vivid language to create a stronger sense of presence.**
* **Hold back the information about Robert's death until later in the story.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Juxtaposition:** The contrast between the life-saving organ arriving and the seemingly unrelated detail of the hidden watch creates a slight sense of unease and curiosity.
* **Mystery:** The reader is left wondering why the character is looking for his watch and what its significance might be.

**However:**

* **Lack of Context:** We don't know who "he" is or why he's looking for the watch. This lack of context makes it difficult to connect with the scene emotionally.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The paragraph ends abruptly, leaving the reader hanging without a sense of resolution or direction.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Establish a clearer connection between the organ arrival and the character's actions.**
* **Hint at the importance of the watch and the potential consequences of not finding it.**
* **End on a cliffhanger that leaves the reader wanting more.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Detail:** The detail about the watch adds a layer of mystery and raises questions about its significance.
* **Clear Stakes:** The reader understands that the patient's life is at stake, adding emotional weight to the situation.

**However:**

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus more on the characters' reactions and emotions.**
* **Show, rather than tell, the urgency of the situation.**
* **Hint at potential obstacles or complications.**




####################################################################################################
I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of the dull stairwell create a sense of ordinariness rather than suspense.
* **Repetitive Detail:** The repeated mention of the cleaner looking for his watch feels out of place and doesn't contribute to the tension.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There's no sense of danger, threat, or impending doom. The paragraph simply describes a typical workday.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a mysterious element or a hint of danger.**
* **Focus on the cleaner's internal thoughts and feelings, hinting at a hidden worry or secret.**
* **Connect the cleaner's actions to the events happening with the organ transplant in a more meaningful way.**



The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it" is particularly jarring and detracts from any potential suspense. It feels like an unnecessary detail that doesn't serve the narrative.

* **Use more descriptive language to create a more immersive and claustrophobic atmosphere in the stairwell.**
* **Hint at potential dangers or obstacles they might encounter on their way to the 6th floor.**



The repetition of the watch detail is becoming a significant detriment to the suspense. It feels like a red herring that doesn't contribute to the narrative and pulls the reader out of the moment.
