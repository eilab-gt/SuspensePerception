 7.5

The paragraph provides a clear and tense build-up to a critical moment, creating a sense of anticipation and suspense. However, the sudden shift to a different character (He) and the mysterious reference to a hidden watch without further context slightly reduces the overall suspense level. If the focus remained on Robert Bent and the transplant, the suspensefulness could potentially be higher.
