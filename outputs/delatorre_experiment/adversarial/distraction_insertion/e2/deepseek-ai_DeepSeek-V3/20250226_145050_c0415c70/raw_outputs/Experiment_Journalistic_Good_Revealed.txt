I would rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation (a critical liver transplant for a young boy) and includes a time-sensitive element (the uncertainty of whether Robert will survive the wait). The mention of damage to the liver in transit adds a layer of tension.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the immediate resolution provided in the same paragraph (the liver is functioning correctly by 21:26). Additionally, the writing style is more factual and less emotionally engaging, which reduces the sense of urgency and tension.

Overall, while the situation itself is inherently suspenseful, the execution and structure of the paragraph limit its ability to fully engage the reader in the suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph introduces a time-sensitive scenario (the helicopter carrying the organ landing punctually) and mentions Robert Bent's critical condition, which could create some tension.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is minimal because the paragraph lacks detailed buildup or emotional engagement. The mention of the hidden watch feels unrelated and disrupts the flow, detracting from the potential tension. Additionally, the situation is resolved too quickly with the helicopter landing "punctually," which reduces the sense of urgency or uncertainty.

Overall, while there is a hint of suspense, the paragraph does not effectively build or sustain it.

- **Strengths**: The mention of the small blue fridge containing the liver introduces a critical element of the story, which could theoretically create some tension.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The paragraph lacks any real buildup or emotional engagement. The description is straightforward and factual, with no sense of urgency or uncertainty.

I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph introduces a sudden and dramatic event (the man slipping and the case plunging down the stairs), which creates a sense of urgency and potential danger. The stakes are high because the case contains a critical organ for a life-saving transplant.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the unrelated detail about the hidden watch, which disrupts the flow and distracts from the tension. Additionally, the paragraph does not delve into the emotional or immediate consequences of the event, which could heighten the suspense further.
