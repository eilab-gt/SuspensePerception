I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation with a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait adds tension.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diluted by the abrupt and unrelated mention of the boy looking for his hidden watch, which feels out of place and disrupts the narrative flow. Additionally, the paragraph lacks specific details or escalating tension that would heighten the suspense further.

Overall, while there is a foundation for suspense, it is not fully realized in this paragraph.
