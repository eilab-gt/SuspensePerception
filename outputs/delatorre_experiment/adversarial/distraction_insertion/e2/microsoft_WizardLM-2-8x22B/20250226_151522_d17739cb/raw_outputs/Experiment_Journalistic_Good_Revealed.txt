The paragraph does build a sense of suspense by detailing the critical situation of an eight-year-old boy awaiting a liver transplant and the uncertainty of whether he would survive the wait. The mention of a hidden watch that the protagonist cannot find adds a layer of personal urgency to the situation. The specific time of the medical team's verification that the transplant was successful provides a climactic moment. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the reader is informed early on that the transplant was ultimately successful, which reduces tension as the outcome is already known. The suspensefulness is moderate because while there is a clear element of danger and urgency, the narrative structure gives away the positive resolution too early in the paragraph.

This paragraph contains elements that could contribute to suspense, such as the precise timing of the helicopter's arrival and the mention of a critical condition, which suggests a high-stakes situation. The detail of the protagonist looking for a hidden watch and not being able to find it adds a sense of personal tension and possibly a race against time. However, the suspense is limited because the paragraph lacks context about the broader situation, the significance of the watch, and the potential consequences of the protagonist not finding it. The mention of the organ's arrival and the patient being in a stable condition also suggests that things are going according to plan, which can reduce the sense of uncertainty and peril that is typically associated with high suspense.

This paragraph introduces a moment of tension with the arrival of the helicopter and the precious cargo it carries—a liver for transplant stored in a small blue fridge. The specific detail of the fridge's shape and the importance of its contents create a sense of urgency. The repeated action of the protagonist searching for a hidden watch and failing to find it adds a layer of personal anxiety, suggesting that time is of the essence and possibly hinting at a larger narrative of time-sensitive pressure. However, the suspense is somewhat tempered by the fact that the liver is described as "fully functioning," which implies that the organ is viable and the immediate risk to the transplant procedure may be low. The paragraph lacks explicit information about potential complications or the stakes involved, which could have heightened the suspense. Therefore, while there is an underlying tension, the suspensefulness is moderate.

This paragraph introduces a potentially hazardous situation that could lead to suspense. The detail about the cleaner leaving the floor wet without placing a warning sign suggests the possibility of an accident, especially in a high-stakes environment like a hospital where urgency is critical. The protagonist's search for a hidden watch that he cannot find adds a sense of personal urgency and disruption, which could be a crucial factor in an unfolding critical event. The reader is left to anticipate what might happen next due to the oversight and the missing watch, which creates a moderate level of suspense. The suspensefulness is not at the highest level because the paragraph does not yet reveal the consequences of these actions, but it does set the stage for potential incidents that could escalate the tension.

This paragraph builds suspense effectively by combining several elements of potential danger. The decision to use the service stairwell, which may have a wet floor due to the earlier omission of the "wet floor" sign, creates an immediate risk of an accident that could jeopardize the safe transport of the liver. The fact that the two men are unaware of this hazard adds to the tension. Additionally, the recurring motif of the protagonist's inability to find his hidden watch introduces a sense of time pressure and disorientation, which could have critical implications in a situation where every second counts. The reader is left in suspense, anticipating a possible mishap as the men unwittingly approach a potentially dangerous situation. The suspensefulness is high because the paragraph sets up a scenario with clear stakes and an impending sense of threat, though the outcome remains uncertain.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The immediate consequence of the earlier-mentioned hazard—a man slipping on the wet stairs while carrying a case with a vital organ—creates a dramatic and tense moment. The description of the case "plunging" down the stairs introduces a sense of chaos and urgency, as the safety of the liver and the success of the transplant are now in jeopardy. The repeated action of the protagonist searching for his hidden watch and not finding it adds to the suspense by suggesting that time is running out or that the protagonist is unable to respond effectively to the crisis. The reader is left on edge, with the outcome of the fall and the fate of the liver unknown, which heightens the suspense to a very high level. The paragraph effectively creates a cliffhanger, leaving the reader eager to find out what happens next.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense. The immediate action taken by the colleague to warn the doctors suggests the gravity of the situation and the potential for a critical outcome. The fact that the case containing the liver is left unhandled until the doctors arrive creates a tense waiting period, during which the reader is left to wonder about the condition of the organ and whether it has been damaged. The protagonist's ongoing search for his hidden watch, which he still cannot find, continues to add personal stakes and a sense of time sensitivity to the unfolding events. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader in suspense by focusing on the immediate aftermath of the accident without revealing the consequences, thus maintaining the tension and anticipation regarding the fate of the liver transplant.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. The prompt arrival of the doctors in response to the emergency is a positive development, but it does not resolve the tension built up by the previous events. The reader is still left wondering about the condition of the liver and the outcome of the situation. The repeated line about the protagonist's search for the hidden watch continues to suggest a sense of urgency and disruption, contributing to the suspense. However, the paragraph is somewhat anticlimactic because it does not provide new information about the critical situation at hand, nor does it escalate the tension further. The suspensefulness is in the middle range because while there is still uncertainty about the resolution, the paragraph lacks the intensity or detail that would significantly heighten the suspense.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The revelation that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured introduces a significant and immediate complication to the transplant procedure. The reader is left to grapple with the potential consequences of this development, which could be dire for the patient awaiting the transplant. The tension is further amplified by the ongoing subplot of the protagonist's inability to find his hidden watch, which continues to imply a personal struggle against time or a critical need for situational awareness. The paragraph effectively creates a sense of crisis, as the characters—and the reader—must confront the possibility that the life-saving organ may have been compromised. The suspensefulness is high because the paragraph presents a critical setback without immediately revealing the implications or the characters' ability to manage the situation, thus maintaining a high level of tension and concern for the outcome.

This paragraph holds a moderate to high level of suspense. The action of taking the case to the hepatic laboratory for a biopsy indicates that the doctors are actively working to assess the condition of the liver, which is a critical step in determining whether the transplant can proceed. This creates tension as the reader is aware of the potential for the organ to have been damaged during the fall. The repeated line about the protagonist searching for and not finding his hidden watch adds to the suspense by suggesting that time is of the essence and that the protagonist may be struggling to maintain control over the situation. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader engaged by focusing on the diagnostic process, which is a pivotal moment in the narrative, without revealing the results of the biopsy. The suspensefulness is moderate to high because the paragraph sets up a scenario with significant stakes and leaves the reader in anticipation of the medical verdict, which will have a profound impact on the story's outcome.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. The revelation that the liver has withstood the impact and can be used for the transplant provides a sense of relief and resolution to the immediate crisis regarding the organ's viability. This positive outcome reduces the tension that was built up by the previous events. However, the repeated action of the protagonist searching for his hidden watch and failing to find it continues to suggest an underlying sense of urgency or personal distress that has not been resolved. The paragraph brings closure to one aspect of the suspense but maintains some level of tension through the ongoing subplot of the watch. The suspensefulness is in the middle range because, while there is still a lingering personal issue for the protagonist, the critical threat to the liver transplant has been alleviated, and the most immediate source of suspense has been largely resolved.

This paragraph has a relatively low level of suspense. The confirmation that Robert Bent's newly transplanted liver is functioning correctly and was not affected by the earlier damage is a positive resolution to the central tension of the story—the success of the liver transplant. This announcement significantly reduces the suspense because it assures the reader that the critical aspect of the narrative has been successfully concluded. The repeated line about the protagonist's search for the hidden watch, which he still cannot find, does add a layer of personal tension, but it is overshadowed by the good news of the transplant's success. The suspensefulness is on the lower end of the scale because the primary source of suspense—the outcome of the transplant—has been resolved, and the remaining personal issue with the watch does not carry enough weight on its own to maintain a high level of suspense.
