I'd rate this paragraph a **6** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** Starting with "What you are about to read is the story of a real event" immediately grabs the reader's attention and sets a serious tone.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a life-or-death situation, a critical patient, and a time-sensitive transplant creates inherent suspense.
* **Ticking Clock:** The phrase "awaiting the arrival of the organ" implies a race against time, adding to the tension.
* **Uncertain Outcome:** The sentence "However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" leaves the reader wondering about Robert's fate.

**However:**

* **Spoiler Alert:** The last sentence reveals the tragic outcome, somewhat diminishing the suspense. A more effective approach might be to delay revealing Robert's death until later in the story.


Overall, the paragraph effectively sets up a suspenseful scenario but loses some impact by revealing the ending too soon.
