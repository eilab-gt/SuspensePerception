I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the medical team and Robert's family waiting for the arrival of a liver transplant. The mention of Robert's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph is still quite straightforward and doesn't have any major plot twists or surprises, which prevents it from being more suspenseful. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which also reduces the suspenseful effect.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution, as the organ has finally arrived, which reduces the tension and suspense built up in the previous paragraph. The use of the phrase "punctually" adds a sense of precision and timing, which could create a sense of anticipation, but overall, the paragraph is more focused on providing information about the event rather than building suspense. The tone is still informative and matter-of-fact, which doesn't create a sense of urgency or danger, making it less suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by emphasizing the importance of speed and the critical condition of the patient. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades", creates a sense of chaos and intensity. The fact that the two men are trying to communicate with each other over the noise of the helicopter blades adds to the sense of urgency and raises questions about what they are trying to convey. The nod and the movement towards the exit creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen next. The overall tone is more intense and suspenseful than the previous paragraphs, with a sense of danger and high stakes.

The use of phrases like "it wasn't a particularly interesting job" and "it was an agreeable job" reinforces the idea that this is a routine, uneventful task. The description of the service stairwell as "dull" and "without windows" creates a sense of monotony, and the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to put up "wet floor" warning signs suggests that there is no real urgency or danger.

The noise of the case rolling down the stairs, described as "a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag", is a particularly effective way to convey the sense of chaos and danger.

The use of vivid descriptions, such as "a sort of small padded fridge" and "a long split down one side", creates a sense of unease and raises questions about what might have happened to the liver.

The fact that the medical team is working under pressure, with a child's life hanging in the balance, raises the stakes even higher. The description of the surgeon's nervousness and the risk of damaging the organ irreparably creates a sense of high-stakes tension. The use of phrases such as "one millimetre out" and "he would damage the organ irreparably" creates a sense of precision and raises questions about the consequences of failure.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is a straightforward and factual summary of the outcome of the medical procedure, and does not create a sense of tension or suspense. The use of a specific time, "21:26", adds a sense of realism and precision, but does not contribute to the suspensefulness of the paragraph. The outcome is predictable and positive, and the reader is left with a sense of relief rather than suspense or anticipation. The paragraph is more of a conclusion or a wrap-up, rather than a suspenseful or cliffhanger ending.
