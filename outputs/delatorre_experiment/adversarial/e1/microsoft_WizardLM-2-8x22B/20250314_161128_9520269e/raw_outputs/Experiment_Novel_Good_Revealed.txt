This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a specific, time-sensitive event—the landing of a helicopter carrying the much-needed organ for Robert Bent's transplant. The precision of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival by helicopter, which suggests urgency and high stakes, contribute to a sense of tension. The reader is likely to be invested in the outcome, wondering if everything will go according to plan and whether the organ will reach Robert in time and in good condition. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the phrase "punctually" and the description of Robert's condition as "critical but stable," which may imply that things are proceeding as well as can be expected under the circumstances.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense. The vivid description of the men emerging from the helicopter with the critical organ in tow creates a cinematic and tense atmosphere. The specific details, such as the blue case maintaining the liver at a precise temperature and the urgency conveyed by the men's actions and the need to communicate non-verbally due to the noise, all contribute to a sense of immediacy and high stakes. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the reminder that there is no time to lose further escalates the tension. The reader is likely to be fully engaged, wondering if the team will successfully navigate the challenges and deliver the liver in time to save Robert's life.

This paragraph introduces an element of potential danger with the cleaner failing to place "wet floor" signs in the service stairwell, which could lead to an accident, especially in a high-stakes environment like a hospital where every second counts. The mundane details of the cleaner's routine and the contrast between the service stairwell and the more engaging corridors create a backdrop that feels disconnected from the main suspenseful event, which may serve to build atmosphere rather than immediate tension.

The suspense here is more subtle and indirect, as it sets up a scenario that could intersect with the urgent situation of Robert's liver transplant. The reader might anticipate a possible complication arising from the wet floors, which could impact the delivery of the liver or the well-being of the characters involved in the transplant process. The paragraph is suspenseful in the sense that it hints at a potential obstacle, but it does not directly escalate the immediate tension surrounding Robert's condition, hence the lower score on the suspensefulness scale.
