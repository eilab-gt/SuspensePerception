The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical and time-sensitive medical situation involving a young boy in dire need of a liver transplant. The mention of the donor organ being found and the imminent nature of the transplant, coupled with the uncertainty of whether Robert will survive the wait, creates a sense of urgency and tension. The specific details, such as the date and the boy's name, add to the realism and gravity of the situation, enhancing the suspense. However, as this is only the setup for the story, the full extent of suspense may be contingent upon how the narrative unfolds beyond this introduction.

This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a pivotal moment in the story—the arrival of the helicopter with the life-saving organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of precision and high stakes. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the situation is still precarious, maintaining tension. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the organ has arrived, which is a positive development in the story. The reader is likely to feel relief that the organ is on-site but still concerned about the outcome of the transplant and Robert's survival, hence the suspense is sustained but not at its peak.

This paragraph continues to build on the narrative by introducing the arrival of the men with the organ. The description of the "small blue fridge, in the shape of a case," adds a tangible element to the story, emphasizing the importance and delicate nature of the cargo they carry. The specific mention of the liver being "fully functioning" is a positive sign, but the suspense remains as the reader is aware that the success of the transplant is not guaranteed. The focus on the careful transport of the organ underscores the high stakes and the meticulous process involved in organ transplantation. While the suspense is present, it is moderate because the paragraph describes a routine part of the transplant process rather than an unexpected twist or complication.

This paragraph introduces a new element of potential risk with the cleaner failing to display a "wet floor" sign after mopping the service stairwell. The timing, "minutes earlier," suggests that the oversight could lead to a critical incident, especially considering the urgency of the situation with the organ delivery. The reader's awareness of the potential hazard introduces a sense of foreboding, as it could impact the safe and timely transport of the liver or the well-being of the medical team. The suspense is generated by the anticipation of a possible accident or delay, but since the incident has not yet occurred, the suspense is moderate rather than high. The reader is left to speculate on the consequences of this oversight, which maintains a level of tension in the narrative.

This paragraph raises the suspense level by directly connecting the two men transporting the liver with the potential hazard previously introduced—the recently mopped and unmarked wet floor in the service stairwell. The decision to use the service stairwell for descent creates a sense of impending danger, as the reader anticipates the risk of an accident due to the wet conditions. The focus on their choice to walk down the stairs, rather than taking an alternative route or being alerted to the danger, heightens the tension. The reader is aware of the potential for a slip or fall that could jeopardize the liver's safety, which is crucial for Robert's survival. This situational irony, where the reader possesses knowledge that the characters lack, is a classic suspense-building technique.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense as it describes the immediate consequence of the oversight in the previous paragraphs. The moment of the slip is sudden and critical, with the case containing the liver "plunging down the stairs," which poses a direct threat to the success of the transplant and Robert's life. The vivid description of the accident and the use of active voice create a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is likely to feel a sharp increase in tension due to the uncertainty of the organ's condition after the fall and the potential impact on the impending surgery. This event is a dramatic turning point in the narrative, and the suspense is high as the reader is left to wonder about the outcome of the fall and its implications for the characters involved.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by detailing the immediate aftermath of the accident. The colleague's urgent action to warn the doctors introduces a new sense of urgency and conveys the gravity of the situation. The decision to leave the case unhandled until the doctors arrive creates a tense waiting period, as the reader is left to speculate on the condition of the liver inside the case and whether it has been damaged. The suspense is sustained by the uncertainty surrounding the viability of the organ and the potential consequences for Robert. The focus on the characters' actions in response to the crisis keeps the reader engaged and concerned about the outcome, which is a hallmark of suspenseful storytelling.

This paragraph provides a moment of relief and resolution, which slightly reduces the suspense built up in the previous paragraphs. The prompt arrival of the doctors suggests that the situation is being addressed by the appropriate personnel, which can alleviate some of the tension. However, the brevity and lack of detail about the condition of the liver or the next steps in the process leave room for uncertainty. The reader is likely to be curious about the doctors' assessment and the implications for the transplant, but the suspense is moderate because the paragraph implies a controlled response to the crisis rather than an escalation of danger or complications. The focus now shifts to what the doctors will find and decide, which sets the stage for the next phase of the narrative.

This paragraph re-escalates the suspense to a high level by revealing a significant complication in the situation. The discovery that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured introduces a direct threat to the viability of the organ and, by extension, to Robert's life. The reader is likely to feel a surge of tension upon learning of this setback, as it raises questions about the organ's usability and the potential need to find another donor, which could be life-threatening given Robert's critical condition. The suspense is heightened by the dramatic irony that, despite the doctors' prompt response, an unforeseen issue has arisen, creating a new cliffhanger in the narrative. The reader is left in suspense, eagerly anticipating how the medical team will address this critical challenge.

This paragraph sustains a moderate to high level of suspense by transitioning the narrative into a crucial diagnostic phase. The action of taking the case to the hepatic laboratory for a biopsy indicates that the medical team is actively working to assess the condition of the liver. The focus on the surgeon's responsibility and the specific medical procedure creates a sense of urgency and importance. The reader is aware that the results of the biopsy will determine the organ's suitability for transplant, which directly affects Robert's chances of survival. While the suspense is not at its peak because the paragraph describes a controlled and methodical response to the crisis, the uncertainty of the organ's viability keeps the tension high. The reader is left anticipating the outcome of the biopsy, which is a pivotal moment in the story.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level by revealing the outcome of the biopsy, which has dire implications for the transplant. The analysis confirming that the liver has not withstood the impact and cannot be used for the transplant introduces a major setback in the narrative. The reader is likely to feel a heightened sense of tension and concern for Robert's fate, as this news drastically alters the course of his treatment and chances of survival. The suspense is intensified by the finality of the situation; with no backup organ mentioned, the reader is left to wonder what will happen next and whether there is any hope left for Robert. This moment of crisis is a classic suspense-building element, as it presents a seemingly insurmountable obstacle for the characters involved.

This paragraph brings a resolution to the narrative, confirming the tragic outcome for Robert Bent. The suspense is somewhat reduced because the conclusion of Robert's story is revealed, and the tension that was building around the potential for a successful transplant is resolved. However, the paragraph still carries a sense of suspense because it raises questions about the broader implications of the event, such as the impact on the medical team, the investigation into the incident, and the potential for future preventative measures. The specificity of the time of death (21:26) adds a somber note of finality, which can evoke a strong emotional response from the reader. While the immediate suspense surrounding Robert's fate is concluded, the narrative leaves room for reflection on the circumstances that led to this outcome, maintaining a moderate level of suspense in the context of the story's broader consequences.
