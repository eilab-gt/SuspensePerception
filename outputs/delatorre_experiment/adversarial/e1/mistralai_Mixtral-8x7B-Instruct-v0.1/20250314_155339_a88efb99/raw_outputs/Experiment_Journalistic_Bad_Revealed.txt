 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the description of the helicopter landing and the mention of the boy's critical condition, it lacks the same level of detail and urgency as the previous paragraph.

  I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph does not directly relate to the main storyline about the liver transplant and the boy's critical condition, so it may not be immediately clear to the reader how it fits into the narrative.
