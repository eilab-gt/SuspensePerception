 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does add to the tension by introducing a helicopter carrying the critical organ, it lacks the context and background information needed to fully engage the reader. The reader is not given any information about the significance of the organ or why it is so important for Robert Bent.

Overall, the paragraph provides a small amount of suspense, but it could be improved with more context and background information.

  I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The use of the word "fridge" may be a bit jarring and unexpected, but it does add to the sense of urgency and importance of the organ. However, the paragraph still lacks some context and background information to fully engage the reader. It would be helpful to know more about the significance of the organ and why it is so critical for Robert Bent.

It's worth noting that the level of suspense can be subjective and may vary depending on the reader's perspective and familiarity with the story. However, based on the information provided in the paragraph, I believe a rating of 6 out of 9 is appropriate.
