I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening sentence sets up a real-life event with potential for drama.  
* **Medical Tension:**  The mention of a liver transplant, a critical situation, and a race against time creates some initial suspense.
* **Jumbled Text:**  The numerous nonsensical words (like "sNkjt," "eLHjF," "wkn0F")  disrupt the flow and make it difficult to fully engage with the story. This actually detracts from the suspense.
* **Lack of Build-Up:** The paragraph jumps quickly from anticipation to the tragic outcome without building much tension or emotional investment in Robert's fate. 

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Replace the gibberish words with meaningful ones.**
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his feelings, his hopes, and his fears.
* **Build tension gradually:**  Hint at complications, delays, or setbacks leading up to the tragic ending.
* **End on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a question or a sense of unresolved tension.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** There's no sense of urgency or danger. The paragraph simply states facts without evoking any feelings in the reader.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Use descriptive language:**  Paint a picture of the scene, the helicopter, and the person involved.
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  Use words that convey a sense of time pressure or impending danger.
* **Hint at a conflict:**  Suggest that something is wrong or that there is a threat.
