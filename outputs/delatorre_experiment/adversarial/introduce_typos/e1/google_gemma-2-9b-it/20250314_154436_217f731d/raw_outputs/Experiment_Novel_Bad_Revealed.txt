I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening sentence sets up a real-life event with potential for drama and tension.
* **Medical Context:**  The mention of a liver transplant and a critical situation immediately creates a sense of urgency and concern.
* **Jumbled Text:**  The numerous nonsensical words (like "sNkjt," "eLHjF," "wkn0F")  disrupt the flow and make it difficult to fully engage with the story. This actually detracts from the suspense, as it feels more like a technical error than a deliberate stylistic choice.
* **Lack of Build-Up:** The paragraph jumps quickly from preparation to the tragic outcome without building any real tension or anticipation. 

**To increase the suspensefulness, the author could:**

* **Replace the gibberish words:**  This will make the text readable and allow the reader to focus on the story.
* **Develop the characters:**  Give us a glimpse into Robert's personality or the medical team's emotions to create an emotional connection.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds, the smells, to immerse the reader in the scene.
* **Create a sense of ticking clock:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation and the dwindling time available for the transplant.
