The paragraph provided is difficult to read due to the inclusion of nonsensical strings of characters that disrupt the narrative. However, if we assume that those strings are placeholders for a coherent text, the paragraph describes a real-life medical emergency with a tragic outcome, which could potentially be suspenseful. The elements of suspense include the high stakes of a liver transplant, the critical condition of the patient, and the uncertainty of whether the organ would arrive in time and in a suitable condition. The final sentence, which implies that the story will reveal what actually happened, could also add to the suspense. However, the disruption caused by the nonsensical strings of characters significantly detracts from the paragraph's ability to build suspense. If we were to rate the paragraph based on its potential content, it might score a 6 or 7 on the suspense scale, but due to the readability issues, I would rate it as a 3.
