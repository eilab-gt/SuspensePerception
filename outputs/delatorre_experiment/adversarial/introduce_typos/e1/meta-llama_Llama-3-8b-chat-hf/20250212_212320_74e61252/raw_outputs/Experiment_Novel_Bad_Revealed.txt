I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is written in a dry, factual style, with no attempt to build tension or create suspense. The use of technical medical terms and dates and times also makes the text feel more like a report or a news article than a suspenseful story. The only hint of drama is the mention of Robert's critical condition and the fact that the liver transplant was not successful, but even this is presented in a matter-of-fact way without any emotional or narrative build-up. Overall, the paragraph is more informative than suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and uncertainty by using vague and unclear language, which makes the reader wonder what is happening and what will happen next. The use of technical terms like "helicopter" and "roof" creates a sense of realism, and the mention of the person being in a "but" situation implies that something is wrong. The use of abbreviations and acronyms also adds to the sense of mystery and confusion. However, the paragraph is still somewhat unclear and lacks a clear narrative or emotional hook, which prevents it from being more suspenseful.
