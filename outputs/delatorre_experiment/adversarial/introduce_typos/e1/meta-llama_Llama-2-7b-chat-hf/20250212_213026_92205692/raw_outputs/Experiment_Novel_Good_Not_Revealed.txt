  I would rate this paragraph as a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The paragraph starts with a dramatic and mysterious scene: two men descending from a helicopter while their hair is blown by the spinning blades, with one of them clutching a blue case containing a compatible liver. This creates a sense of intrigue and raises questions in the reader's mind.

3. The paragraph creates a sense of tension by using phrases like "realizing that he hadnâ€™t managed to make himself heard" and "touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wDkWf and gT3j at the doorway off the roof". These phrases convey a sense of urgency and panic, as the men are trying to communicate in a noisy and dangerous environment.
4. The use of short, punchy sentences (e.g. "The man carrying the case gave a visible nod...", "sfLpI ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit") creates a sense of rapid-fire action and adds to the overall sense of tension and urgency.
5. The paragraph ends with a cliffhanger: "During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a dg8hjfWl situation and they had no time to lose." This leaves the reader wondering what the situation is and what will happen next, creating a sense of suspense.
