 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides some intriguing details, such as the arrival of a helicopter carrying a transplant organ and the fact that it landed on the roof of a hospital in a "somewhat controlled but not entirely stable" manner.

This would help to create a stronger connection with the reader and make the stakes of the situation more clear and tangible. Additionally, the author could consider using more descriptive language and vivid imagery to bring the scene to life and create a greater sense of urgency and tension.
