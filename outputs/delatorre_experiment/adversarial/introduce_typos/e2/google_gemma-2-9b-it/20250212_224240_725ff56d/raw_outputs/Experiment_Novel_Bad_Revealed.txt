I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening sentence sets up a real-life event with potential for drama.  
* **Medical Tension:**  The mention of a liver transplant, a critical situation, and a race against time creates some initial suspense.
* **Jumbled Text:**  The numerous nonsensical words (like "sNkjt," "eLHjF," "wkn0F")  disrupt the flow and make it difficult to fully engage with the story. This actually detracts from the suspense.
* **Lack of Build-Up:** The paragraph jumps quickly from anticipation to the tragic outcome without building tension or exploring the emotional stakes. 

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Replace the gibberish words with meaningful ones.**
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his fear, hope, or the sensations he's experiencing.
* **Highlight the medical team's struggle:** Show their determination, their growing worry, and the difficult decisions they face.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** Use vivid language and pacing to make the reader feel the pressure of time.
