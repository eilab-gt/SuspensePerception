I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The real-life setting and the high stakes of a liver transplant create initial interest.
* **Time pressure:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the organ introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of clarity:** The jumbled words and phrases (likely typos) actually detract from the suspense. They make the writing confusing and disrupt the flow, preventing the reader from fully immersing in the situation.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the typos:** Clear, concise language is crucial for building tension.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition is critical, describe his symptoms or the medical team's worried expressions.
* **Build anticipation:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles during the transplant process.
* **End on a cliffhanger:** Instead of revealing the successful outcome, leave the reader wondering if the liver will function properly.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mystery:** The paragraph introduces a mysterious element â€“ a "neiiSLOg2d DaGguUGn" arriving on the hospital roof. The jumbled words create a sense of the unknown and pique curiosity.

* **Visual details:** The description of the men descending, the spinning blades, and the case being carried adds a cinematic quality and draws the reader into the scene.

* **Introduce a potential obstacle:** Perhaps there's a delay at the hospital entrance, a security check, or a sudden change in the patient's condition.
* **Focus on internal thoughts:** Give the reader access to the thoughts and feelings of one of the men carrying the liver. Are they worried? Determined? 
* **End on a cliffhanger:** Instead of them reaching the exit, end the paragraph just as they encounter an unexpected problem.

* **Foreshadow a potential problem:**  Subtly suggest that something bad might happen later in the day, connecting it to the janitor's seemingly mundane tasks.
* **Focus on the janitor's perspective:** Give him thoughts, feelings, or observations that hint at a hidden tension or unease.
* **End with a question or cliffhanger:** Leave the reader wondering what will happen next, even if it's something small and seemingly insignificant.
