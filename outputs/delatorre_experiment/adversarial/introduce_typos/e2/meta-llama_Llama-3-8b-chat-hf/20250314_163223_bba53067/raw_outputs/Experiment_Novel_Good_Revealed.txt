The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the critical situation of the patient, Robert, and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait for the liver transplant.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and uncertainty by describing the situation as "critical" and the patient's condition as "serious". The use of the word "but" also implies that something unexpected or surprising is about to happen. The fact that the patient is on the roof of the hospital adds to the sense of urgency and danger. However, the paragraph is still somewhat vague and doesn't provide enough information to create a strong sense of suspense. The reader is left wondering what is happening and what will happen next, but the paragraph doesn't provide enough clues to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the situation as "critical" and emphasizing the importance of speed. The use of vivid imagery, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "hair blown" by the rotor wash, helps to create a sense of chaos and danger. The fact that the men are trying to communicate with each other over the noise of the helicopter blades adds to the sense of urgency and difficulty. The use of specific details, such as the temperature of the case and the watch on the wrist, helps to create a sense of realism and adds to the suspense. The paragraph also raises questions, such as what is in the case, what is the patient's condition, and what is happening at the doorway, which keeps the reader engaged and curious. The only thing that keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively straightforward and factual description, without any major plot twists or surprises.

The use of specific details, such as the location of the helipad exit, the service stairwell, and the corridors, helps to create a sense of realism and adds to the suspense. The conversation between the two men also raises questions, such as what is the patient's condition, why is it not worth taking the lift, and what will happen when they reach the 6th floor.

The use of words like "not worth" and "it'll take longer" also implies that something is at stake and that time is of the essence.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is more focused on the aftermath of the previous events rather than creating a sense of tension or suspense. The description of the men kneeling down beside the case and discussing what to do next is more of a calm and rational conversation than a tense or dramatic moment. The warning to "not" pick up the case and the decision to call the doctors instead adds a sense of caution and prudence, but it's not particularly suspenseful. The paragraph does create a sense of anticipation as the reader waits to see what will happen next, but it's more of a slow-burning tension rather than a sudden and intense moment of suspense. The only thing that adds a hint of suspense is the mention of the man's colleague staying behind to watch the case, implying that something might happen while he's away, but it's not enough to elevate the paragraph to a higher level of suspensefulness.
