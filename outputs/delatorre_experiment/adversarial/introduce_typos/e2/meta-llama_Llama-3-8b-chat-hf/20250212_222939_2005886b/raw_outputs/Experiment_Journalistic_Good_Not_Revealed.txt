I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is immediately aware that something significant is about to happen.
* The use of specific details, such as the date and time, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more urgent.
* The description of Robert's critical condition and the uncertainty surrounding his survival creates a sense of tension and raises questions in the reader's mind.
* The use of phrases like "what happened" and "the story of what happened" creates a sense of mystery and implies that something unexpected or dramatic will unfold.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created a stronger sense of urgency or danger. For example, it could describe Robert's condition in more vivid terms or hint at the consequences of failure.
* Introduced more conflict or obstacles. For example, it could mention potential complications or risks associated with the transplant.
* Built up the tension more gradually. For example, it could describe the events leading up to the transplant or the emotions of the medical team and Robert's family.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting the stage for a suspenseful story, but could benefit from a few more elements to make it even more engaging.

* The paragraph is very short and lacks any context or background information, which makes it difficult to understand what is happening or why it is suspenseful.
