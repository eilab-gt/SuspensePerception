 I would rate the suspensefulness of this paragraph as a 7 out of 9. The paragraph does a good job of building tension and anticipation around the liver transplant surgery, highlighting the urgency of the situation and the potential risks involved. The use of phrases such as "they were not sure if he would survive the wait" and "finally, at 21:26" add to the suspense and keep the reader engaged. However, the paragraph could have been even more suspenseful if it provided more details about the challenges and obstacles that the medical team faced during the surgery, or if it revealed the outcome of the surgery at the very end, leaving the reader in suspense until the last moment.
