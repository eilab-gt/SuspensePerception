 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This would help to create a stronger connection with the reader and make the stakes of the situation more clear and tangible. Additionally, the author could consider using more descriptive language and vivid imagery to bring the scene to life and create a greater sense of urgency and tension.
