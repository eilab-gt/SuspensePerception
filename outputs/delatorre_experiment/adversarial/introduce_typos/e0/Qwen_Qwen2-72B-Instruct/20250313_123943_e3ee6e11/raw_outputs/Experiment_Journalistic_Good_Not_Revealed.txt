The paragraph has some elements of suspense, particularly in the uncertainty surrounding whether the eight-year-old boy, Robert Bent, will survive the wait for his liver transplant. However, the use of scrambled text and abbreviations makes the paragraph difficult to read and understand, which detracts from the suspense. Overall, I would rate the paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness. If the text were clearer and more coherent, the suspense would likely be higher. Here is a revised version of the paragraph that is easier to read and understand:
"What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco on December 24, 2008. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight-year-old boy named Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before, a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. This is the story of what happened." 
This revised paragraph would likely be rated higher for suspensefulness, perhaps a 7 or 8 out of 9.
