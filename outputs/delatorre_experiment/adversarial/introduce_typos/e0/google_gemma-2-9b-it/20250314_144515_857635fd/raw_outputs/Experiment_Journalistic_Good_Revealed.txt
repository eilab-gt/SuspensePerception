I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a real event and a liver transplant immediately grabs attention and sets up potential for suspense.
* **High Stakes:** The description of Robert's critical condition and the urgency of the situation create a sense of tension.
* **Disrupted Flow:** The random, nonsensical words scattered throughout the paragraph severely disrupt the flow and readability. This actually detracts from the suspense, as it becomes more distracting than engaging.
* **Lack of Build-Up:**  The paragraph jumps quickly from the wait for the organ to the successful transplant without building any real suspense or anticipation. 

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Remove the gibberish:**  Replace the nonsensical words with meaningful ones to create a clear and engaging narrative.
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his feelings, thoughts, and experiences leading up to the transplant.
* **Build tension:**  Use descriptive language and pacing to create a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about the outcome.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Subtly suggest that the transplant might not be a guaranteed success, raising the stakes.
