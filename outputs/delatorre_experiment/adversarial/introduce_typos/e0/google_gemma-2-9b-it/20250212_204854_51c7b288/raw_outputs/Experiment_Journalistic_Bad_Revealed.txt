I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a liver transplant immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The paragraph establishes the urgency of the situation with Robert's critical condition and the need for a timely transplant.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The sudden death of Robert despite the organ being found creates a strong sense of disappointment and raises questions about what went wrong.

**However, it lacks sustained suspense:**

* **Lack of Build-Up:** The paragraph jumps quickly from the initial setup to the tragic ending without much build-up or tension.
* **Unclear Threats:** We don't know what specific dangers Robert faces or what obstacles the medical team might encounter.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** While the situation is serious, the paragraph doesn't effectively evoke strong emotions in the reader, which is crucial for building suspense.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on the emotional journey of Robert and his family.**
* **Describe the challenges and risks of the transplant procedure in more detail.**
* **Introduce a sense of mystery or uncertainty about the organ's condition or the cause of Robert's death.**
