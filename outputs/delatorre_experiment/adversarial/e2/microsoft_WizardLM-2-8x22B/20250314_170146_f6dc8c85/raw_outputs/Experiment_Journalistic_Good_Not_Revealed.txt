7

The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical and time-sensitive medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the suitability of the donor and the critical condition of the boy creates a sense of urgency and high stakes. The specific details, such as the date and the name of the child, add to the realism and gravity of the situation. The open-ended conclusion, "This is the story of what happened," invites the reader to wonder about the outcome, thus maintaining suspense. However, without more immediate tension or a clear conflict to be resolved, the suspense is somewhat tempered, which is why a score of 7 seems appropriate—it's suspenseful but not at the highest end of the scale.

This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a specific event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—that is crucial to the boy's survival. The mention of the precise time of the landing and the condition of the boy creates a sense of immediacy and importance. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the description of Robert's condition as "critical but stable," which suggests a momentary pause in the urgency of his situation. The punctuality of the helicopter's arrival might also imply a moment of relief, which can reduce the suspense slightly. Therefore, while there is a clear build-up of tension and a significant event has occurred, the suspense is not at its peak, warranting a rating of 6 on the scale.

This paragraph introduces a moment of action with the arrival of the men carrying the liver in a specialized container. The description of the "small blue fridge, in the shape of a case," adds a tangible element to the scene, which can create suspense as the reader anticipates the next steps in the transplant process. However, the suspense is somewhat diluted by the assurance that the liver is "fully functioning," which suggests a positive development in the story. The focus on the procedural aspect of the transplant, rather than on potential complications or emotional tension, keeps the suspense level moderate. Therefore, on the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 5 for suspensefulness.

4

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could have implications for the unfolding story, specifically the safety of those carrying the liver and the smooth execution of the transplant process. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and not displaying a "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it sets up a scenario where someone might slip and fall, potentially jeopardizing the mission. However, the suspense is somewhat muted because the event described is only a potential risk rather than an immediate threat or conflict. The reader is left to speculate on the consequences of this oversight, which may or may not materialize. Therefore, while there is an element of suspense in the setup, it is not as intense or immediate as it could be, warranting a rating of 4 on the suspensefulness scale.

This paragraph sets up a situation where the characters are unknowingly heading towards a potential danger—the recently mopped and unsigned stairwell. The decision to use the service stairwell introduces an element of risk, as the reader is aware of the hazard from the previous paragraph. However, the suspense is relatively mild because there is no immediate peril or action taking place; the men are simply making a choice about their route, and the consequences of that choice are yet to be revealed. The suspense is more about the anticipation of what could happen rather than a direct threat or conflict occurring at this moment. Therefore, on the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 3 for suspensefulness, as it hints at potential danger without escalating the tension significantly.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level by introducing an immediate and critical complication to the situation. The slip and subsequent fall of the case containing the liver down the stairs creates a sense of urgency and high stakes, as the success of the transplant—and the life of young Robert Bent—hangs in the balance. The description of the case "plunging" down the stairs adds a visceral and dramatic element to the scene, which heightens the tension. The reader is left in suspense regarding the condition of the liver and whether the transplant can proceed as planned, making this a highly suspenseful moment. On the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around an 8 for suspensefulness, as it presents a direct and severe threat to the central conflict of the story.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by detailing the immediate response to the crisis and emphasizing the importance of the case's contents. The action of one man going to alert the doctors while the other remains with the case, ensuring it is not mishandled, underscores the gravity of the situation. The directive that the case must not be touched until the doctors arrive adds to the tension, as it suggests that any further disturbance could be detrimental. The reader is left with several critical questions: Is the liver still viable? Can the transplant proceed? How will this affect Robert's chances of survival? The suspense is sustained by the uncertainty of the outcome and the potential consequences of the fall. On the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 7 for suspensefulness, as it keeps the reader engaged and concerned about the resolution of the event.

This paragraph provides a resolution to the immediate crisis by indicating that the doctors have arrived promptly, which suggests that professional help is now present to address the situation. The suspense is reduced because the reader knows that the next steps in assessing and potentially salvaging the situation are now in the hands of capable individuals. However, the paragraph does not reveal the condition of the liver or the fate of the transplant, so there is still some level of suspense regarding the outcome. The prompt arrival of the doctors is a positive development, but it does not in itself create a high level of suspense. Therefore, on the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 4 for suspensefulness, reflecting a moderate level of tension as the reader awaits further information on the critical condition of the liver and Robert's prospects.

The discovery that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured introduces a direct threat to the success of the transplant and the life of the young boy awaiting the organ. The reader is left with a cliffhanger regarding the viability of the liver and whether this setback can be overcome. The suspense is heightened by the dramatic tension between the urgency of the situation and the potential for a catastrophic outcome. The paragraph does not provide immediate answers, which keeps the reader in a state of uncertainty and concern for the characters involved. On the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around an 8 for suspensefulness, as it presents a severe and unexpected obstacle that jeopardizes the central conflict of the story.

This paragraph introduces a critical step in the process that could determine the success of the transplant, creating a moderate to high level of suspense. The action of taking the case to the hepatic laboratory for a biopsy indicates that the doctors are actively working to assess the condition of the liver and make an informed decision about its viability. The involvement of a responsible surgeon and the technical procedure of the biopsy add to the tension, as the reader understands that the outcome of this assessment is crucial. However, the paragraph does not present an immediate threat or a real-time unfolding of events, which means the suspense is more about the anticipation of the results than a direct confrontation with danger or a twist in the plot. On the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 6 for suspensefulness, as it keeps the reader engaged and anxious about the potential success or failure of the transplant.

This paragraph provides a resolution to the immediate tension by confirming that the liver has withstood the impact and can be used for the transplant. While this is a positive development in the narrative, the suspense is significantly reduced because the critical question of the liver's viability has been answered in a favorable way. The reader's concern about whether the transplant can proceed is alleviated, which diminishes the sense of uncertainty that fuels suspense. However, there may still be some level of suspense regarding the transplant procedure itself and the boy's recovery, which is yet to be described. On the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 5 for suspensefulness, reflecting a moment of relief and a decrease in tension after the climax of the crisis has passed.
