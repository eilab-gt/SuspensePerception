The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene with a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the donor organ's arrival being uncertain and the boy's life hanging in the balance creates a sense of urgency and tension. The specific details, such as the time of the final verification of the liver's function, add to the suspense by highlighting the precision and high stakes of the situation. The reader is left curious about the events that transpired during the wait and the outcome of the transplant, which contributes to a high level of suspense. However, since the paragraph concludes with the information that the liver was functioning correctly, some of the suspense is resolved, which is why it might not score a full 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a specific event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—that is crucial to the boy's survival. The mention of the precise time of landing and the description of the boy's condition as "critical but stable" creates a sense of urgency and anticipation. The reader is likely to be engaged, wondering whether the organ will arrive in time and in suitable condition for the transplant to proceed. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually," suggesting that things are going according to plan, which may reduce the tension slightly. Therefore, while the paragraph does build suspense, it does not leave the reader with an unresolved cliffhanger, placing it in the middle range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph introduces a moment of action with the arrival of the men carrying the small blue fridge containing the liver. The specific detail of the fridge's shape and its critical contents contributes to the suspense by emphasizing the importance of the cargo. The reader is likely to be curious about the condition of the liver and whether it will successfully reach its destination and be transplanted into Robert Bent. However, the suspense is somewhat tempered by the description of the liver as "fully functioning," which suggests that, at least up to this point, the organ is viable. The paragraph does not present an immediate threat or complication, which means it builds suspense but does not reach the highest levels of tension where the outcome is more uncertain.

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could have implications for the ongoing critical situation. The detail about the cleaner mopping the floor and not displaying the "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it sets up a scenario where someone could slip and fall, potentially jeopardizing the delivery of the liver. The mention of "minutes earlier" adds urgency, suggesting that the event is closely tied to the current timeline. However, the suspense is not at its peak because there is no immediate consequence shown, and the reader is left to infer the potential danger. The paragraph sets up a situation that could lead to suspense, but without a direct connection to the main characters or a clear and present threat, it remains in the moderate range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level by directly connecting the two men transporting the critical liver to the previously mentioned hazard—the freshly mopped and potentially slippery service stairwell. The decision of the men to use the stairwell sets the stage for a potential accident that could threaten the success of the transplant. The reader is likely to feel a sense of apprehension, knowing that the men are unaware of the danger posed by the wet floor. The suspense is heightened by the imminent risk and the reader's anticipation of a possible mishap. The paragraph effectively creates tension by combining an everyday occurrence (mopping a floor) with a high-stakes situation (transporting a life-saving organ), leaving the reader concerned about the outcome and engaged in the narrative.

This paragraph escalates the suspense to a very high level by depicting the immediate consequence of the hazardous situation set up in the previous paragraph. The man carrying the case slipping and the case with the liver plunging down the stairs creates a critical moment where the success of the transplant is in jeopardy. The reader is likely to feel a sharp increase in tension, as the event directly impacts the life-or-death situation of Robert Bent. The vivid description of the accident and the uncertainty of the organ's condition after the fall leave the reader on edge, wondering about the implications for the boy's survival. This moment of action and its uncertain outcome contribute to a high level of suspense, making it highly engaging and tense for the reader.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by showing the immediate reaction to the crisis and emphasizing the importance of the case's contents. The colleague's urgent action to warn the doctors suggests the gravity of the situation, while the other man's vigilance over the case without moving or inspecting it further underscores the delicate nature of the organ inside. The reader is left in suspense, not knowing the condition of the liver after the fall and whether it is still viable for transplant. The focus on the characters' responses to the accident and the careful treatment of the case heightens the tension, as the reader anticipates the doctors' assessment of the organ's viability. The paragraph effectively continues the suspenseful narrative, keeping the reader engaged and concerned about the outcome.

This paragraph adds a layer of suspense by highlighting the prompt response of the doctors to the emergency, which indicates the high stakes and urgency of the situation. The reader is likely to feel a sense of relief that the medical team is now present to address the potential crisis, but this is tempered by the continued uncertainty regarding the condition of the liver after its fall. The brevity and simplicity of the statement "The doctors arrived promptly" serve to build anticipation for what comes next, as the reader is keen to learn the outcome of the doctors' assessment. While the paragraph contributes to the overall tension of the narrative, it does not in itself contain a dramatic event or cliffhanger, placing it in the mid-range of the suspense scale.

The reader is likely to feel intense concern and anxiety over this unexpected turn of events, as it presents a serious obstacle that the medical team must now overcome.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by transitioning to a critical next step in assessing the condition of the liver. The mention of the hepatic laboratory and the surgeon performing a biopsy emphasizes the medical urgency and the precision required to determine the organ's viability. The reader is likely to be highly engaged, waiting anxiously for the results of the biopsy, which will decide the fate of the transplant and, consequently, the life of Robert Bent. The paragraph effectively continues the tension of the narrative, as the outcome remains uncertain and the stakes are life-and-death. The focus on the medical team's actions to address the crisis contributes to the suspense, as the reader anticipates the results that will reveal whether the transplant can proceed.

This paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution to the immediate suspense by confirming that the liver has withstood the impact and is suitable for transplant. While the reader may feel a release of tension due to this positive development, the paragraph still retains a degree of suspense because the transplant itself has not yet occurred, and there could be other unforeseen complications. The use of the word "possible" also leaves a slight opening for potential issues, which keeps the reader somewhat on edge. The suspense is reduced from the previous high-stakes moments, but the narrative still holds interest as the reader looks forward to the successful completion of the transplant process. This paragraph serves as a transition point in the story, where the immediate crisis has been averted, but the final outcome is yet to be secured.

This paragraph concludes the immediate narrative by confirming the successful outcome of the transplant, which significantly reduces the suspense. The reader learns that Robert Bent's liver is functioning correctly post-transplant, and any potential issues from the damage sustained in transit have been resolved. While there is satisfaction in the resolution of the story, the suspense is largely dissipated because the primary source of tension—the uncertainty of the transplant's success—has been positively addressed. The paragraph serves as a closure to the dramatic events, reassuring the reader that the main character's life is no longer in immediate danger. Therefore, on the suspense scale, it ranks lower, as the narrative has reached a point of resolution.
