This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a pivotal moment in the story—the arrival of the helicopter with the life-saving organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of urgency and precision required in the situation. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that there is still a significant risk involved, and the outcome is not guaranteed. This moment is a turning point that could go either way, which helps to maintain suspense. However, the suspense level is slightly lower than the previous paragraph because it focuses on a single event rather than building upon the existing tension and uncertainty.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense. It vividly describes the intense and precise process of transferring the life-saving organ from the helicopter to the hospital, emphasizing the urgency and care required. The detailed imagery of the men descending from the helicopter, the blue case containing the liver at a precise temperature, and the communication difficulties due to the noise all contribute to a palpable sense of tension. The specific actions, such as the man checking his watch and pointing to indicate the urgency, along with the reminder that the patient is in a critical situation, underscore the high stakes and the race against time. The focus on the careful handling of the organ and the clear directive that there is no time to lose leaves the reader on edge, wondering if the transplant team will be able to successfully complete their task before it's too late.

This paragraph introduces a potential element of suspense with the cleaner's routine of mopping the service stairwell and not placing "wet floor" signs at the top of each section. The detail about the cleaner's habits and the environment of the stairwell sets the stage for a possible accident or complication that could interfere with the urgent delivery of the organ. However, the suspense is relatively mild because there is no direct connection to the immediate life-threatening situation of Robert Bent, and the actions described are part of a routine that has presumably been carried out without incident many times before. The paragraph does create a sense of foreboding, as the reader might anticipate that the wet floors could lead to a problem, but without a more direct link to the central tension of the story, the suspense level is moderate.

This paragraph raises the suspense level by introducing a potential obstacle in the critical path of the organ delivery. The decision to use the service stairwell instead of the lift due to time constraints adds urgency to the situation. The specific details about the layout of the hospital and the route the men must take to reach the patient on the 6th floor create a vivid mental image for the reader and underscore the importance of every second. The fact that the service stairwell was recently mopped and may still be wet introduces an element of risk, as it could lead to a slip or delay, which would be particularly dangerous given the time-sensitive nature of their mission. The reader is likely to feel a sense of anxiety about whether the men will navigate the stairs safely and reach the patient in time, thus maintaining a high level of suspense.
