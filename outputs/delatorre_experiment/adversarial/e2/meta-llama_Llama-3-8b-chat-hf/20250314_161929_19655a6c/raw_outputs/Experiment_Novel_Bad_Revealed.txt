I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by setting the scene for a potentially life-or-death situation, introducing a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the medical team's certification of Robert's death, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more intense.

However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it had more dramatic language or a clearer sense of the stakes. For example, the phrase "his situation was critical" is somewhat vague, and the paragraph could benefit from more vivid descriptions of Robert's condition or the emotions of the medical team. Additionally, the paragraph's tone is somewhat matter-of-fact, which may reduce the sense of tension and suspense. Overall, the paragraph is effective in building suspense, but could be even more effective with more dramatic language and a clearer sense of the stakes.
