 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The narrative sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant, the critical condition of the young boy, and the uncertainty about the donor organ's condition. The suspense is further heightened by the specific time details and the build-up to the moment when the medical team verifies the liver's function. However, the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. While the landing of the helicopter adds a sense of urgency and anticipation, the paragraph does not provide much information about the overall situation or the stakes involved, which limits its suspenseful impact.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the suspensefulness scale. While the mention of the cleaner mopping the floor and not putting up a "wet floor" sign could potentially create a sense of tension or danger, it does not directly relate to the main storyline of the liver transplant and does not build suspense in a meaningful way. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to make a more direct connection to the main storyline, such as: "Minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign, unaware that the organ that could save the life of eight-year-old Robert Bent was about to be transported through the very same area." This would help to create a more immediate and impactful connection between the cleaner's actions and the main storyline, and increase the suspense.
