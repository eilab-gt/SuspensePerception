 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty about the young boy's survival. The use of the phrase "critical situation" and the mention of the "entire medical team" adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful by providing more details about the boy's condition, the urgency of the situation, or the potential complications that could arise during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of anticipation with the arrival of the helicopter, but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could describe the helicopter's approach, the tension in the hospital as it lands, or the importance of the organ's timely arrival.  Additionally, the paragraph could provide more context about the organ's donor and the urgency of the situation to create a stronger sense of suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension with the description of the men rushing to deliver the liver and the mention of the patient's critical condition. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the helicopter's blades and the feeling of the wind on the men's hair, adds to the suspense. Additionally, the paragraph creates a sense of anticipation with the mention of the liver being "compatible" and the men's awareness of the need to act quickly. Overall, the paragraph effectively builds suspense and creates a sense of urgency.  However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition, the potential consequences of a delayed transplant, or the challenges the men face in transporting the liver to the operating room.  ​

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell, but it does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story. In fact, the paragraph seems to be a distraction from the main narrative and does not add any tension or anticipation. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to provide more context about the cleaner's role in the hospital or how the cleaner's routine is disrupted by the events of the story.  Additionally, the paragraph could be rewritten to create a sense of foreshadowing or tension by describing the cleaner's observations or interactions with the hospital staff or patients that hint at the critical situation unfolding in the story.  ​

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful by providing more details about the patient's condition, the potential consequences of a delayed transplant, or the challenges the men face in navigating the hospital.  To increase the suspense, the paragraph could also describe the men's physical exertion as they rush down the stairs or the sound of footsteps echoing in the empty hospital corridors.  ​  ​

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could also describe the men's physical reactions, such as their hearts racing or their hands trembling, as they watch the case roll down the stairs.  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​
