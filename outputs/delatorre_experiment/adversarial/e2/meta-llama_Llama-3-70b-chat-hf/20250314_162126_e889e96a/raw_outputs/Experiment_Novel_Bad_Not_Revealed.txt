I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts with a hook that grabs the reader's attention: "What you are about to read is the story of a real event..." This creates a sense of intrigue and makes the reader curious.
* The setup of the story is clear and concise, establishing the setting, characters, and situation.
* The introduction of the critical situation and the uncertainty of Robert's survival creates tension and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert survive?" or "What will happen to him?"
* However, the paragraph is still quite straightforward and lacks a sense of urgency or immediate danger. The situation is critical, but it's not like Robert is in imminent danger of dying in the next few minutes.
* The paragraph also ends with a somewhat calming phrase, "This is the story of what happened," which takes some of the edge off the suspense.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating some tension, but it could be more suspenseful with more dramatic language, a greater sense of urgency, or a cliffhanger ending.
