 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some additional information about the situation, such as the arrival of the helicopter carrying the liver, it does not do much to build on the tension and suspense established in the previous paragraph.

Additionally, the paragraph does not provide any new information about Henry's condition or the progress of the transplant, which could have helped to maintain the suspense.
