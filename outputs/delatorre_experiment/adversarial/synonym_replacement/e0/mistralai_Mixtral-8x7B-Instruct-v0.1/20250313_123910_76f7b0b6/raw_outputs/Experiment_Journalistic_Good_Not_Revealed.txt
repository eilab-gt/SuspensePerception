 I would rate the paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively sets the scene and creates a sense of anticipation for the upcoming liver transplant surgery. The use of phrases such as "quick for his imminent liver graft" and "they were not trusted if Henry m. robert would live on the wait as his berth comprise decisive" add to the suspense and uncertainty of the situation.

 I would rate the paragraph a 3 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides very little context or information about the situation, and the sentence is written in a very straightforward and factual tone. There is no sense of danger, uncertainty, or tension established in the paragraph.

To make the paragraph more suspenseful, the author could provide more context about the situation, describe the characters' emotions and thoughts, and use more descriptive language to create a sense of atmosphere. Additionally, avoiding medical jargon and using more common terms would help the reader to understand and engage with the story.
