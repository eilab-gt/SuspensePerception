The paragraph sets up a scenario with inherent tension due to the medical urgency of a liver transplant for a young boy. The mention of the recent discovery of a suitable donor and the uncertainty of whether Henry Martyn Robert Bent would survive long enough for the transplant introduces a sense of suspense. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph is framed as a recounting of past events, which implies that the reader will be informed of the outcome, thus reducing the immediacy of the tension. The suspensefulness could be heightened with more vivid details, a focus on the emotions of those involved, and less certainty about the outcome.

This paragraph introduces an action that is critical to the life of the character, Henry Martyn Robert, which naturally carries some level of suspense. The specificity of the time and the arrival of the helicopter with the organ create a sense of urgency. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph is brief and lacks detail about the potential complications or the condition of Henry Martyn Robert. It is a snapshot of an event that could lead to a tense situation but does not in itself convey the emotional weight or the potential obstacles that could heighten the suspense. To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could include more about the risks involved, the reactions of the medical team, or the state of Henry Martyn Robert's health at that moment.

This paragraph provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine work in the hospital, which includes mopping the stairwell and interacting with staff and patients in the corridors. While the narrative is descriptive and sets the scene, it lacks elements that typically create suspense, such as imminent danger, uncertainty, or a sense of urgency. The cleaner's actions are described as routine and even enjoyable, which does not suggest that anything out of the ordinary is about to happen. The mention of the "wet floor" signs not being used could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but without a direct connection to an impending critical event or a sense of impending doom, the suspensefulness of this paragraph remains relatively low. It serves more as a character study and setting description than a source of suspense.
