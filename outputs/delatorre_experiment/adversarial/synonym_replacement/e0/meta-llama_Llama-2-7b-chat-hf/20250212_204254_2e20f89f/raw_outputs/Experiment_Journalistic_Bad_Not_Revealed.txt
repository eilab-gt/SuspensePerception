  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The paragraph starts with a hook: "What you are about to read is the tale of a material effect that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital..." This immediately grabs the reader's attention and makes them want to know more.
2. The use of time and place adds to the suspense: "on twenty four Feb 2008" and "in San Francisco, California" create a sense of immediacy and location, making the reader feel like they are there in the hospital.
3. The mention of a "wonderful donor" and the expectation of the organ's arrival adds to the tension: The reader is left wondering if the child will receive the transplant in time and if he will survive the waiting period.
4. The use of the child's name and age adds a personal touch: "eight yr old boy Henry martyn robert Bent" makes the reader more invested in the child's fate.

However, there are a few things that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite long and could benefit from some breaks to create more tension: The lack of breaks between sentences and the long paragraph structure makes it difficult to build tension and create a sense of urgency.
2. The language is somewhat straightforward and lacks a sense of mystery or foreboding: The use of simple language and straightforward descriptions doesn't create a sense of unease or uncertainty, which is crucial for building suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could benefit from some tweaks to create more tension and uncertainty for the reader.
