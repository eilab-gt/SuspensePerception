I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant.

The paragraph feels more like a factual report than a gripping narrative. Additionally, the grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("What you be about to record," "the tale of a material effect") detract from the overall impact.

Overall, while the situation is inherently suspenseful, the execution could be improved to heighten the emotional engagement and tension.
