I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation (a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant) and creates tension by mentioning the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait. The time-sensitive nature of the event and the critical condition of the boy add to the suspense.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the awkward phrasing and grammatical errors, which can distract the reader. Additionally, the paragraph doesn't delve deeply into the emotional or physical stakes, nor does it build much anticipation about what might happen next. The phrase "This is the write up of what happen" feels abrupt and doesn't heighten the tension.

Overall, while the situation itself is inherently suspenseful, the execution could be improved to make it more gripping.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph mentions a helicopter landing with the organ, which is a critical moment in the story. The fact that Robert is in a "decisive simply unchanging consideration" (assuming this means critical but stable condition) adds a layer of tension.

- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is significantly undermined by the unclear and awkward phrasing (e.g., "decisive simply unchanging consideration"). The lack of detail about the urgency, the stakes, or the emotions involved makes it hard for the reader to feel invested or anxious. Additionally, the paragraph is very short and doesn't build anticipation or explore the potential consequences of the situation.

Overall, while the scenario has the potential to be suspenseful, the execution falls short in creating a gripping or tense atmosphere.

I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph introduces a visual element (the small blue refrigerator/case containing the liver) and the arrival of two people from the helicopter, which adds a sense of urgency and importance to the scene. The focus on the liver, the critical organ for the transplant, hints at the high stakes of the situation.

- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is limited by the lack of emotional or descriptive depth. The paragraph doesn't convey the tension or anxiety surrounding the moment, nor does it explore the potential consequences of the liver's arrival. The phrasing is also somewhat awkward (e.g., "unmatchable of whom be comport a belittled bluing electric refrigerator"), which can distract the reader and reduce the impact of the scene.
