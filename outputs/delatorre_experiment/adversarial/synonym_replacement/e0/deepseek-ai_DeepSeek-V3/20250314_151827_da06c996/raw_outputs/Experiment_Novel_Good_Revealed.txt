I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation (a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant) and mentions the uncertainty of his survival, which creates some tension.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is diminished because the outcome is revealed too quickly (the liver is functioning correctly by the end of the paragraph). Additionally, the writing style is somewhat clinical and lacks vivid details or emotional depth, which could have heightened the suspense. The grammatical errors and awkward phrasing also detract from the overall impact.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could focus more on the waiting period, the emotional state of the characters, and the potential risks or complications, rather than revealing the successful outcome so soon.
