I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph provides a detailed and vivid description of the cleaner’s routine, which sets the scene and establishes a sense of normalcy. This could potentially serve as a contrast to a later suspenseful event, but on its own, it doesn’t create tension.

The tone is calm and descriptive, which is the opposite of suspenseful.
