I would rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It sets up a situation with potential for suspense:** A child needing a life-saving transplant, a race against time, and the uncertainty of whether he'll survive.
* **However, the writing is clunky and grammatically incorrect:** This makes it hard to get fully invested in the story and the suspense.
* **The reveal at the end is anticlimactic:**  We learn the transplant failed, but the reason ("damage in transit") is given without much build-up or emotional impact.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Polish the writing:** Correct grammar and sentence structure will make the story more engaging.
* **Build tension gradually:**  Describe Robert's condition, the team's anxiety, and the ticking clock more vividly.
* **Delay the reveal:**  Hint at the problem with the organ without explicitly stating it, leaving the reader to wonder what went wrong.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing elements:** The mention of a helicopter carrying a vital organ creates immediate interest. The phrase "vital but static status" adds a layer of uncertainty about Robert's condition.
* **Limited context:** We don't know the full situation, which adds to the suspense. What's the urgency? Why is the organ arriving by helicopter?
* **Abrupt ending:** The paragraph ends suddenly, leaving the reader wanting to know what happens next.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the tension in the room, the team's reactions.
* **Hint at potential problems:**  Is there a delay? Is the organ damaged? Are there complications with the transplant?
* **Use stronger verbs:** Instead of "land duly," consider more evocative verbs like "plummeted," "descended," or "touched down."

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Strong visual imagery:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, hair tousled by the blades, creates a vivid and tense scene.
* **Sense of urgency:** The mention of the liver being "fully functioning" and the patient being in a "critical spot" raises the stakes.
* **Focus on time:** The emphasis on the watch and the need to "not waste time" adds to the feeling of pressure.
* **Unclear communication:** The inaudible words and the reliance on gestures create a sense of mystery and potential for miscommunication.

**To enhance suspense:**

* **Heighten the stakes:** What are the consequences if they fail? What's at risk for Robert?
* **Introduce an obstacle:** Perhaps there's a delay, a security check, or a sudden problem with the liver.
* **Show the characters' emotions:** How are they feeling under pressure? Are they confident, anxious, or determined?

* **Lack of conflict or tension:** There's no sense of danger, urgency, or impending threat.
* **Passive voice and detached narration:** The writing style is distant and objective, which prevents the reader from connecting with the janitor or feeling invested in his actions.

* **Obstacles and decisions:** The choice to bypass the east wing shortcut adds a layer of tension, as it suggests a risk or a potential delay.
* **Limited information:** We don't know why the east wing is a bad option, which piques curiosity.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Heighten the stakes:** Emphasize the patient's critical condition and the consequences of a delay.
* **Create a sense of danger:**  Hint at something threatening in the east wing, or suggest that the men are being followed.
* **Use more vivid language:** Describe the men's movements, their expressions, and the environment in a way that evokes tension and anxiety.
