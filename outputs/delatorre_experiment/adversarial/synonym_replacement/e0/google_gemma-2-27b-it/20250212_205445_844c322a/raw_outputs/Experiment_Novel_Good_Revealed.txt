I would rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It reveals the outcome too early:** The paragraph states that the transplant was successful right at the end. This removes a lot of the tension that could be built around whether Henry would survive.
* **The language is factual and clinical:** While it mentions a life-or-death situation, the tone is detached and lacks emotional weight.  
* **There's no immediate threat or conflict:** We know a donor was found, so the main obstacle (finding a liver) is already overcome.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Delay revealing the outcome:**  Keep the reader guessing about Henry's fate until later in the story.
* **Focus on Henry's emotional state:** Describe his fear, hope, or pain to create empathy and raise the stakes.
* **Introduce a new conflict or complication:** Perhaps there's a delay in the organ arrival, or a complication during the surgery.
