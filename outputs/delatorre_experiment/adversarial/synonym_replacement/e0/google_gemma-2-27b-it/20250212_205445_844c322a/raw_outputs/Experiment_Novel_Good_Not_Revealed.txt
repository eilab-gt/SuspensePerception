I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation with a real-life medical case, a critical patient, and a time-sensitive procedure.
* **Lack of immediate tension:** The language is a bit dry and factual, which reduces the immediate sense of urgency. 
* **Unclear stakes:** While we know Robert's condition is critical, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen in time.
* **Awkward phrasing:**  Some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("veridical case," "eighter from decatur year former son") detract from the overall impact.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Include his thoughts and feelings about the impending surgery.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Describe the potential consequences of failure more vividly.
* **Use more evocative language:** Replace dry, factual language with more descriptive and sensory details.
* **Shorten sentences and create a faster pace:** This will increase the sense of urgency.

* **Short, impactful sentences:** The brevity of the sentences adds to the tension and creates a sense of immediacy.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **High stakes:** The urgency of the situation is clear â€“ a life depends on the successful delivery of the liver.
* **Action-packed:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter and rushing towards the hospital creates a sense of movement and purpose.
* **Vague details:** The lack of clarity about what the man is shouting and the nature of the "vital post" adds to the mystery and suspense.

**However:**

* **Lack of emotional connection:** We don't get a sense of the characters' emotions or the weight of the situation.

**To increase suspense:**

Here's why:

* **Mundane setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine tasks creates a sense of ordinariness and predictability.

* **Focus on the cleaner's internal thoughts and feelings:** Is he bored? Anxious? Does he sense something is wrong?

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a clear resolution to the suspense built up throughout the story. The liver is functioning correctly, and the patient is safe.
* **Lack of tension:** The language is straightforward and lacks the tension and uncertainty that characterized the previous paragraphs.
* **Abrupt ending:** The paragraph feels somewhat abrupt, lacking a sense of closure or reflection on the events that transpired.

**What could be improved:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of simply stating that the liver is functioning correctly, describe the doctors' reactions, the patient's condition, or the atmosphere in the operating room.
* **Emotional impact:** Explore the emotions of the medical team and the patient's family after the successful transplant.
* **Lingering questions:** Leave the reader with something to ponder, such as the long-term implications of the transplant or the impact of the experience on those involved.



While the paragraph provides a satisfying conclusion to the story, it lacks the suspenseful elements that made the previous paragraphs so engaging.
