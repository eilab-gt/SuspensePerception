I would rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It reveals the outcome too early:** The paragraph states that the transplant was successful right at the end. This removes a lot of the tension that could be built around whether Henry would survive.
* **The language is factual and clinical:** While the situation is serious, the writing style is dry and lacks emotional engagement.  
* **There's no immediate threat or conflict:** We know Henry is sick, but there's no sense of urgency or danger in the present moment.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Start with the transplant in progress:**  Begin with the surgery happening, creating immediate tension.
* **Focus on Henry's condition:** Describe his struggles and the fear of his family.
* **Introduce doubt about the donor organ:** Hint at potential complications or delays.
* **Use more evocative language:**  Employ sensory details and emotional language to draw the reader in.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing image:** The image of a helicopter landing on a hospital roof with a vital organ is inherently dramatic and raises questions.
* **Sense of urgency:** The time ("08:57") and the use of "shore duly" suggest a race against time.
* **Limited information:** We don't know the full context, which adds to the mystery.

**What could be improved:**

* **Build tension:** The paragraph is quite short and could benefit from more detail to heighten the suspense. Describe the atmosphere in the hospital, the reactions of the medical team, or Henry's condition.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that Henry is in a "decisive" condition, describe his symptoms or the doctors' concerns.

Overall, this paragraph has a good foundation for suspense but could be more effective with some expansion and sensory details.

Overall, this paragraph is quite suspenseful and effectively conveys the urgency and importance of the situation.

Here's why:

* **Mundane setting and activity:** The focus on a routine cleaning job in a hospital stairwell lacks inherent tension or excitement.
* **Lack of conflict or threat:** There's no sense of danger, mystery, or impending disaster.
* **Passive voice and detached tone:** The writing style is objective and unemotional, failing to engage the reader on an emotional level.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a strange or unsettling element:** Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, hears a noise, or experiences a strange feeling.
* **Hint at a hidden danger:**  Suggest that something is amiss in the hospital, creating a sense of unease.
* **Focus on the cleaner's perspective:** Explore his thoughts and feelings, revealing any anxieties or suspicions he might have.
