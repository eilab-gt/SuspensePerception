I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation with a real-life medical case, a critical patient, and a time-sensitive procedure.
* **Lack of immediate tension:** The language is a bit dry and factual, which reduces the immediate sense of urgency. 
* **Unclear stakes:** While we know Robert's condition is critical, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen in time.
* **Awkward phrasing:**  Some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("veridical case," "eighter from decatur year former son") detract from the overall impact.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Include his thoughts and feelings about the impending surgery.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Describe the potential consequences of failure more vividly.
* **Use more evocative language:** Replace dry, factual language with more descriptive and sensory details.
* **Shorten sentences and create a faster pace:** This will increase the sense of urgency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing action:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ creates a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Short, impactful sentences:** The brevity of the sentences adds to the tension and creates a sense of immediacy.
* **Vague details:** The lack of detail about Robert's condition and the atmosphere in the hospital leaves room for the reader's imagination to fill in the blanks, increasing suspense.

**To increase suspense further:**

* **Sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the whirring of the blades, the tension in the air.
* **Robert's reaction:** Show how Robert reacts to the arrival of the organ, even if it's just a subtle change in his expression.
* **Internal monologue:** Give the reader a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of the medical team as they await the arrival of the organ.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **High stakes:** The urgency of the situation is clear â€“ the patient is in critical condition and time is of the essence.
* **Action-packed:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter and rushing towards the hospital creates a sense of movement and purpose.
* **Vague details:** The lack of clarity about what the man is shouting and the nature of the "vital post" adds to the mystery and suspense.

**However:**

* **Awkward phrasing:** The language is clunky and grammatically incorrect ("oral sex down," "helium hadn't managed to reach himself heard"). This detracts from the overall impact.
* **Lack of emotional connection:** We don't get a sense of the characters' emotions or the weight of the situation.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Refine the language:** Use clearer, more concise language to create a more immersive experience.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the patient is in a "vital post," describe the patient's condition and the urgency of the situation through sensory details and action.
* **Focus on the characters:** Give the reader a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of the men carrying the liver. Are they anxious? Determined? Hopeful?

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine tasks creates a sense of ordinariness and predictability.
* **Lack of conflict or tension:** There are no immediate threats or challenges to create suspense.
* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("the service stairwell had no window," "the faculty used the lifts") distances the reader from the action and reduces the sense of immediacy.

**This paragraph serves more as exposition, setting the scene and establishing the cleaner's routine. It lacks the elements necessary to create suspense.**


To make this paragraph more suspenseful, you would need to introduce a conflict or threat. For example:

* **The cleaner could discover something unusual in the stairwell:** a strange object, a hidden message, or a sign of a struggle.
* **The cleaner could sense that something is wrong:** a feeling of being watched, a strange noise, or an unsettling atmosphere.
* **The cleaner could be interrupted by an unexpected event:** a power outage, a fire alarm, or the arrival of someone suspicious.

* **Visual details:** The description of the surgeon drawing out the specimen and the colleague examining it under the microscope adds a layer of realism and tension.

* **Lack of detail:** The language is straightforward and lacks the vivid imagery and sensory details that could heighten the emotional impact of the moment.
* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("was verified," "had been sustained") distances the reader from the action and reduces the sense of immediacy.

* **Build up to the climax:** Instead of revealing the outcome directly, create a sense of anticipation by describing the final moments of the surgery and the doctors' careful monitoring of the patient's condition.
