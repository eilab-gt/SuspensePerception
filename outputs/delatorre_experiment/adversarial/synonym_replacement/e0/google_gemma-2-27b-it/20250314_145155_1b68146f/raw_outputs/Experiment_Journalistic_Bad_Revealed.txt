I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph starts with a strong hook, claiming to be based on a true event and setting a specific time and location. This immediately piques the reader's curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The situation with Robert Bent needing a liver transplant creates tension. The reader understands the urgency and the potential for tragedy.
* **Unclear Outcome:** The paragraph hints at a negative outcome ("they follow not sure if Henry martyn robert would survive") but doesn't explicitly state what happens. This leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Pacing:** The paragraph feels a bit rushed. Slowing down the pacing and building up the tension more gradually would make it more suspenseful.
* **Spoiler Alert:** The last sentence reveals the tragic outcome, removing much of the suspense. It would be more effective to keep the reader guessing until later in the story. 


By addressing the grammatical issues, refining the pacing, and withholding the ending, the author could significantly increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph.
