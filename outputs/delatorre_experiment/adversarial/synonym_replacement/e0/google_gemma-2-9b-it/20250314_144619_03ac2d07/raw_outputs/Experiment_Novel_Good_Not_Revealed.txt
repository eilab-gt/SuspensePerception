I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a "veridical case" and a medical emergency immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly life-or-death, with Robert needing a liver transplant urgently.
* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding Robert's survival, stating that "they be not certain if Henry martyn robert would exist the wait."

**However, it lacks some key elements that would elevate the suspense:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While Robert's condition is critical, the paragraph doesn't present any immediate, tangible danger. We don't know what specific complications he's facing.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was found," "be not certain") makes the writing feel less immediate and engaging.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the situation rather than showing us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* Introduce a ticking clock element (e.g., the organ is only viable for a limited time).
* Hint at a potential complication or obstacle.
* Use active voice and sensory details to create a more immersive experience.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of a helicopter with an organ at a critical moment definitely piques curiosity.
* **Unusual Language:** The use of phrases like "whirlybird bear the harmonium shoot down" creates a slightly unsettling and mysterious tone.

**However, it falls short in several areas:**

* **Lack of Clarity:** The language is overly vague and confusing. What is a "harmonium"? What does it mean for Robert to be in a "decisive just unchanging status"?
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel any sense of urgency or fear for Robert's well-being. The paragraph is more descriptive than emotionally engaging.
* **No Clear Threat:** While the helicopter's arrival suggests something important is happening, there's no immediate sense of danger or threat.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Clarify the Language:** Use more precise and understandable words.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical state or the reactions of those around him.
* **Build Tension:** Introduce a ticking clock element or hint at a potential complication with the organ transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the organ and the urgency of the situation are clearly established.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the helicopter's noise, the men's appearance, and the cold temperature of the organ create a vivid and somewhat tense atmosphere.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of the watch and the need to hurry adds a sense of urgency.

**However, it still has room for improvement:**

* **Unclear Communication:** The phrase "he hollo something unhearable" is confusing and doesn't contribute much to the suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("be clutching," "was storing") makes the writing feel less immediate and engaging.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't feel a strong emotional connection to the characters or their mission.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the patient's condition, describe their physical state or the reactions of the medical team.
* **Focus on Internal Conflict:** Explore the thoughts and feelings of the men carrying the organ. Are they nervous? Determined?
* **Introduce a Potential Obstacle:**  Hint at a possible delay or complication that could jeopardize the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the mundane details of a cleaning routine. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or intrigue.
* **Lack of Conflict:** The cleaner's day is described as "comfortable" and "typical." There are no obstacles or challenges to overcome.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("be finished," "be much more enjoyable") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce an Anomaly:**  Something unexpected could happen during the cleaning routine, like finding a hidden object or encountering a strange person.
* **Create a Sense of Unease:**  The setting could be described in a way that evokes a feeling of unease or dread.
* **Hint at a Larger Story:**  The paragraph could suggest that the cleaning routine is somehow connected to a larger mystery or conspiracy.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setting:** The description of the helipad exit, service stairwell, and hospital corridors creates a sense of place and atmosphere.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The need to get the organ to the patient quickly is emphasized.
* **Decision Point:** The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a layer of tension and raises the stakes.

**However, it still lacks some elements to make it truly suspenseful:**

* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't feel a strong connection to the characters or their mission.
* **Missing Threat:** While there's a sense of urgency, there's no clear and present danger.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was under cover," "was caught") makes the writing feel less immediate.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the urgency, describe the characters' physical reactions (e.g., their racing hearts, sweaty palms).
* **Introduce a Potential Obstacle:**  Perhaps the stairs are blocked, or there's a malfunction with the lift.
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  What are the consequences if the organ doesn't reach the patient in time?

I'd rate this paragraph a **7 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Sudden Danger:** The unexpected slip and fall immediately create a sense of danger and uncertainty.

Overall, this paragraph is quite suspenseful and effectively builds tension.

* **Sensory Details:** The "clink," "fraction," and "thin stream of refrigerated air" create a vivid and unsettling image.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Tension:** The paragraph states a positive outcome without building any suspense. We already know the liver was damaged, but the resolution is presented as a simple fact.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was verified," "had not been affected") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.
* **Missing Emotional Impact:** We don't feel the relief or joy that the medical team likely experiences.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the liver is functioning correctly, describe the patient's vital signs improving, or the medical team's reactions.
* **Highlight the Uncertainty:** Even though the outcome is positive, there could still be lingering doubts or concerns.
* **Add a Twist:** Perhaps there's a complication that arises even after the initial success, creating a new layer of suspense.
