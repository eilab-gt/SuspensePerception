I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a needed organ transplant immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of "decisive" condition and the wait for the organ creates a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very general. We don't know enough about Henry's condition, the risks involved, or the emotional state of those involved to feel truly invested in the outcome.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the suspense ("they were not trusted if Robert would survive the wait") instead of showing it through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.
* **Awkward Language:** The numerous grammatical errors and unusual word choices ("astir," "office," "aesculapian") distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.


To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Henry's pain, the anxious faces of the medical staff.
* **Develop characters:** Give us glimpses into Henry's personality, his fears, and his hopes.
* **Build tension through dialogue:**  Use conversations to reveal the stakes and the uncertainty of the situation.
* **Use foreshadowing:**  Hint at potential complications or setbacks.
* **Refine the language:**  Ensure clear and concise writing that flows smoothly.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of the organ by helicopter immediately raises the stakes and suggests urgency.
* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know enough about Henry's condition to truly feel the gravity of the situation.  "Vital simply unchanging precondition" is vague and doesn't evoke much emotion.
* **Awkward Language:**  The phrasing is stilted and unnatural ("whirlybird carry the pipe organ land duly"). This distracts from the potential suspense.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of how Henry or the medical staff are feeling about the arrival of the organ. Are they hopeful? Anxious? 

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Henry's condition, describe his physical symptoms, his labored breathing, the worried faces of the nurses.
* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the smell of antiseptic in the air, the frantic activity in the hospital.
* **Build Anticipation:**  Hint at potential complications or delays in the transplant process.
* **Refine the Language:** Use more vivid and precise language to create a more immersive experience.

To improve the suspense, the author needs to:

* **Clarify the Language:** Use clear and concise language that is easy to understand.
