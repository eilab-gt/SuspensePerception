I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening lines establish a real-life event with high stakes (a life-saving transplant). This immediately piques curiosity.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph highlights the urgency of the situation ("decisive situation," "impendent liver transplant," "not sure if Robert would survive the wait"). 
* **Lack of Narrative Drive:**  The paragraph primarily focuses on providing factual information rather than driving a narrative forward. We know the transplant was successful, which removes a lot of the suspense.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The writing relies heavily on telling us about the situation ("they were not sure," "his situation was decisive") instead of showing us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his fear, hope, or pain.
* **Highlight the medical team's struggle:** Show their anxiety, the challenges they face, and the risks involved.
* **Introduce an unexpected obstacle:**  Perhaps a complication arises during the surgery or a last-minute problem threatens the transplant.
* **End on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader wondering about the long-term outcome or a potential threat.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The specific time ("08:57") and the arrival of the organ by helicopter create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Vivid Imagery:**  Phrases like "whirlybird carry the pipe organ shore duly" create a strong visual and auditory impression, drawing the reader in.
* **Heightened Stakes:**  Describing Robert's condition as "decisive simply static consideration" emphasizes the gravity of the situation and the potential for both hope and tragedy.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph leaves some questions unanswered. What kind of "pipe organ" is it? What does "shore duly" mean? This ambiguity can pique curiosity but also make it harder to fully engage with the suspense.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Clarify the Organ:**  Specify that it's a liver, heart, etc., to make the stakes more concrete.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical appearance or actions to convey his fragility.
* **Introduce a Threat:**  Hint at a potential problem with the organ, the transport, or the surgery itself.
* **End with a Question:**  Leave the reader wondering if the transplant will be successful or if something will go wrong.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Atmosphere:** The description of the helicopter's rotors, the wind, and the urgency of the situation creates a tense and dramatic atmosphere.
* **Focus on Action:** The paragraph is driven by action, with the men descending, carrying the organ, and moving towards the hospital. This keeps the reader engaged and on edge.
* **Intriguing Details:**  The mention of the liver's temperature and the man's inaudible message add a layer of mystery and raise questions about the situation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The repeated emphasis on time ("no time to misplace") and the patient's "vital situation" heightens the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.

**To further enhance the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the patient's condition is "vital," describe their physical state or the medical team's frantic efforts.
* **Introduce a Conflict:** Perhaps there's a problem with the helicopter, a delay, or a sudden change in the patient's condition.
* **End with a Cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader wondering if they will make it in time or if something will go wrong.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful tasks of a hospital cleaner. There's little to suggest anything unusual or dangerous is about to happen.
* **Lack of Conflict:** The cleaner faces no obstacles or challenges. The job is described as "agreeable" and "not particularly interesting."
* **Predictable Plot:** The paragraph follows a clear and predictable pattern: clean the stairwell, take the lift down, collect supplies, continue working. 
* **Absence of Tension:** There are no hints of danger, mystery, or emotional turmoil. The writing style is flat and lacks any elements that would create suspense.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Hint at a Crime:**  The cleaner discovers something out of the ordinary, like a dropped item or a bloodstain.
* **Create a Sense of Unease:**  Describe the hospital in a more unsettling way, with flickering lights, strange noises, or a feeling of being watched.

* **Sense of Urgency:** The emphasis on time ("it'll have taken longer," "walk push down two floors") and the need to get to the patient quickly adds tension.
* **Decision-Making:** The two men's discussion about taking the elevator versus the stairs introduces a conflict and a potential delay.
* **Lack of Clarity:**  The paragraph doesn't explicitly state why the patient is on the 6th floor or what the urgency is. This ambiguity can pique curiosity but also make it harder to fully engage with the suspense.
