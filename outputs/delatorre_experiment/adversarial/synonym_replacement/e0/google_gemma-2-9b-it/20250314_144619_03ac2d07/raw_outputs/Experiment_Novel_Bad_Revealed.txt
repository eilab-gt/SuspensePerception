I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

####################################################################################################
I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Build-Up:** The paragraph simply states the outcome of the events without any build-up or tension. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** It tells us Robert died and the transplant couldn't happen, but doesn't show us the emotional impact or the struggle leading up to this point.
* **Redundancy:** The phrase "without have be capable to have a bun in the oven taboo the liver transplanting" is unnecessarily wordy and confusing.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Show the struggle:**  Instead of stating Robert died, describe the moments leading up to his death. Show the medical team's efforts, the fading hope, and the emotional toll on everyone involved.
* **Focus on the emotional impact:**  Explore the feelings of grief, disappointment, and helplessness experienced by the medical team and Robert's loved ones.
* **Create a sense of loss:**  Highlight the tragedy of the situation and the missed opportunity for a life-saving transplant.



By focusing on the emotional and human aspects of the story, this paragraph could be transformed from a simple statement of fact into a truly suspenseful and moving piece of writing.
