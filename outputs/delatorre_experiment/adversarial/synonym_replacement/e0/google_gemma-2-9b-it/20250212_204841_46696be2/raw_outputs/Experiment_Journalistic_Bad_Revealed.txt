* **Lack of Pacing and Tension Building:** The paragraph tells us what happens rather than showing it.  We're given information about the situation but don't feel the urgency or the emotional weight of the moment. 
* **Awkward Language:** The unconventional grammar and spelling choices detract from the suspense and make it harder to connect with the story.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's condition, the anxious atmosphere.
* **Use active voice and shorter sentences:**  Create a sense of immediacy and urgency.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition is "decisive," describe his labored breathing, his pale skin, the worried faces of the medical team.
* **End on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader wanting more by focusing on a specific moment of tension or uncertainty.
