I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a "veridical case" and a medical emergency immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly life-or-death, with Robert needing a liver transplant urgently.
* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph emphasizes the uncertainty of Robert's survival ("they be not certain if Henry martyn robert would exist the wait").

**However, it lacks some key elements that would elevate the suspense:**

* **Lack of Tension Building:** The paragraph states the facts without creating a sense of urgency or dread. 
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was found," "be not certain") makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of Robert's personality or feelings, making it harder to invest in his fate.


To increase the suspense, the writer could:

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition is critical, describe his symptoms or the doctors' worried expressions.
* **Use active voice:**  "A suited donor had been found" could become "Doctors had finally found a suitable donor."
* **Create a ticking clock:**  Mention a specific time limit or deadline for the transplant.
* **Introduce a conflict or obstacle:** Perhaps there's a complication with the donor organ or a sudden change in Robert's condition.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The mention of a helicopter and a "decisive just unchanging status" hints at something significant happening.
* **Unusual Language:** The use of words like "whirlybird" and "harmonium shoot down" creates a slightly unsettling and mysterious tone.

**However, it falls short in several areas:**

* **Lack of Clarity:** The sentence structure is awkward and confusing. What is the "harmonium shoot down"? What does "decisive just unchanging status" mean?
* **Missing Context:** We don't know who Henry M. Robert is or why the helicopter's arrival is important.
* **No Emotional Hook:** The paragraph is purely descriptive and lacks any emotional resonance or sense of urgency.

**To improve the suspense, the writer could:**

* **Clarify the language:** Replace vague phrases with concrete details.
* **Provide context:**  Give us more information about Robert and the situation.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's status, describe his appearance or actions that convey his condition.
* **Create a sense of anticipation:**  Hint at the potential consequences of the helicopter's arrival.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the helicopter and the mention of a compatible liver clearly raise the stakes. We know time is of the essence.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the wind, the whirring blades, and the men's appearance creates a vivid and slightly chaotic atmosphere.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase "they had no time to lose" emphasizes the pressure on the situation.

**However, it could be improved:**

* **Clarity and Flow:** The sentence structure is still a bit clunky and the language is occasionally awkward. 
* **Emotional Connection:** We still don't have a strong emotional connection to the characters or their mission.
* **Missing Conflict:** While there's a sense of urgency, there's no clear obstacle or threat.

**To boost the suspense further:**

* **Focus on the characters' emotions:** Show their anxiety, determination, or fear.
* **Introduce a potential complication:** Perhaps there's a problem with the liver, a delay, or a sudden change in Robert's condition.
* **Build tension through pacing:**  Use shorter sentences and more active verbs to create a faster pace.



Overall, the paragraph has potential but needs some refinement to reach its full suspenseful potential.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the mundane details of a cleaning routine. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or intrigue.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("the cleaner had finished mowing," "the service stairwell had no window") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There are no obstacles or challenges for the cleaner to overcome.

**To make this paragraph suspenseful, the writer could:**

* **Introduce a strange or unsettling element:** Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, or hears a strange noise.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Describe the stairwell in a more ominous way, emphasizing its darkness, emptiness, or isolation.
* **Hint at a hidden danger:**  Suggest that something is amiss, even if it's not immediately clear what it is.
* **Focus on the cleaner's internal thoughts and feelings:**  Explore their anxieties, suspicions, or growing sense of dread.



As it stands, the paragraph is simply a description of a routine task and lacks any elements that would create suspense.

* **Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of the men's emotions or motivations.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the patient is on the sixth floor, describe the journey down the stairs and the growing sense of urgency.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a complication:** Perhaps there's a problem with the liver, a security threat, or a sudden change in the patient's condition.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the sounds, smells, and sights of the hospital corridors to create a more immersive experience.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a clear resolution to the tension built up in the previous paragraphs.
* **Lack of Detail:** The statement is very brief and lacks the vivid descriptions and emotional impact that would make it truly suspenseful.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("was verified," "had not been affected") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the liver is functioning well, describe the patient's vital signs improving, his color returning, or his breathing becoming easier.
* **Focus on the emotional reactions:** Show the relief and joy of the medical team, the hope in the patient's family, or the lingering anxiety of the surgeon.
* **Add a lingering question:** Even though the liver is functioning, introduce a small element of uncertainty to keep the reader engaged. Perhaps there's a risk of rejection, or a complication that could arise later.



As it stands, the paragraph feels more like a summary than a suspenseful moment.
