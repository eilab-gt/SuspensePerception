I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a child needing a life-saving transplant and the ticking clock creates immediate interest.
* **Building Tension:**  Phrases like "his condition was critical" and "they were not sure if Robert would hold out the wait" effectively build tension.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The abrupt ending with Robert's death and the mention of "what happened" leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish. 
* **Lack of Emotional Depth:** While the situation is serious, the paragraph lacks emotional connection to Robert or the medical team.  

With some editing and a focus on emotional engagement, this paragraph could be much more suspenseful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Tension:** The paragraph simply states a fact – Robert Bent died – without building any suspense or anticipation.
* **Passive Voice:** The heavy use of passive voice ("the medical squad certify the death," "the liver transplanting referable to the harm") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.

**How to Improve Suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's death, describe the scene – the hushed atmosphere, the doctors' expressions, the family's grief.
* **Focus on Character:** Explore the emotions of the medical team or Robert's family. What are they feeling? How are they coping?
* **Raise the Stakes:**  Hint at the consequences of the failed transplant. What will happen to Robert's family? What will the doctors do next?



This paragraph has the potential to be more suspenseful, but it needs to be rewritten with a stronger focus on character, emotion, and action.
