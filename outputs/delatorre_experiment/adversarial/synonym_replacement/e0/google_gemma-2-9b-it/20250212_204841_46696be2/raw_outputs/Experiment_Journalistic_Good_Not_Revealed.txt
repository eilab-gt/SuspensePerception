I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a liver transplant creates immediate interest.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The last sentence, "This is the write up of what happen,"  leaves the reader wanting to know the outcome.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very general. We don't know enough about Robert Bent's condition, the urgency of the situation, or the specific challenges they face. 
* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his feelings, fears, and hopes.
* **Build tension:**  Include details about the ticking clock, the risks involved, and the emotional toll on the medical team.
* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps there's a complication with the donor organ, or a sudden change in Robert's condition.
* **Use stronger verbs and more vivid language:**  Replace generic words like "was" and "were" with more active and descriptive verbs.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Unclear Meaning:** The language is highly unusual and difficult to understand.  "Eggbeater," "harmonium," and "embody in a decisive simply unchanging consideration" are not phrases that create a clear image or sense of urgency.

* **No Tension:** There's no sense of danger, anticipation, or conflict. The sentence structure is flat and doesn't build towards a climax.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The paragraph revolves around a life-or-death situation – a liver transplant. The reader is immediately invested in the outcome.
* **Delayed Gratification:** The paragraph builds suspense by delaying the reveal of whether the transplant was successful. We wait until the very end to find out if the liver is functioning properly.
* **Specific Time:** The mention of a specific time ("21:26") adds a sense of urgency and immediacy to the situation.
* **Vague Language:**  Phrases like "serve right" and "involve by the impairment" are a bit vague and could be made more impactful with clearer descriptions.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating that the liver is functioning, describe the signs of a successful transplant.  
* **Add Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds of the medical equipment, the expressions on the medical team's faces, the patient's breathing.
* **Create a Sense of Anticipation:**  Build up to the moment of truth by describing the team's careful examination of the liver.
