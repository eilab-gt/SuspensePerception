I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a needed organ transplant immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of "decisive" condition and the wait for the organ creates a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very general. We don't know enough about Henry's condition, the risks involved, or the emotional state of those involved to feel truly invested in the outcome.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the suspense ("they were not trusted if Robert would survive the wait") instead of showing it through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.
* **Awkward Language:** The numerous grammatical errors and unusual word choices ("astir," "office," "aesculapian") distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.


To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Henry's pain, the anxious faces of the medical staff.
* **Develop characters:** Give us glimpses into Henry's personality, his fears, and his hopes.
* **Build tension through dialogue:**  Use conversations to reveal the stakes and the uncertainty of the situation.
* **Use foreshadowing:**  Hint at potential complications or setbacks.
* **Refine the language:**  Ensure clear and concise writing that flows smoothly.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Element:** The arrival of the organ via helicopter immediately creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Lack of Detail:**  We don't know enough about Henry's condition to truly feel the weight of the situation.  "Vital simply unchanging precondition" is vague and doesn't convey the severity.
* **Awkward Language:**  The grammatical errors ("08: lvii," "carry the pipe organ land duly") and unusual phrasing ("vital simply unchanging precondition") distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Henry's condition, describe his physical state, his breathing, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Build Tension:**  Describe the helicopter's approach, the anticipation in the air, the frantic preparations inside the infirmary.
* **Focus on Sensory Details:**  Use vivid language to describe the sounds (whirring of the helicopter, beeping machines), smells (antiseptic, fear), and sights (flashing lights, hurried movements).
* **Refine the Language:**  Correct the grammatical errors and use more precise and evocative language.

* **Specific Time:** The mention of "xxi: xxvi" adds a sense of urgency and builds anticipation for the moment of truth.
