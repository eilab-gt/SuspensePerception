I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a liver transplant creates immediate interest.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The last sentence, "This is the write up of what happen,"  leaves the reader wanting to know the outcome.
* **Lack of Tension Building:** The paragraph lacks details that would heighten the suspense. We don't get a sense of Robert's condition, the urgency of the situation, or any potential obstacles. 
* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the narrative and make it harder to get fully invested.

**To improve the suspensefulness, consider:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition is "decisive," describe his symptoms or the doctor's worried expressions.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sterile hospital environment, the beeping of machines, or the anxious atmosphere.
* **Introduce conflict:**  Hint at potential complications with the transplant, a shortage of organs, or a disagreement among the medical team.
* **Tighten the language:**  Correct the grammatical errors and use more vivid and precise words.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Unclear Meaning:** The language is highly unusual and difficult to understand.  "Eggbeater," "harmonium," and "decisive simply unchanging consideration" are not clear descriptions and create confusion rather than intrigue.
* **Lack of Context:** We have no idea who Henry Robert Knack is, why he's in a hospital, or what the significance of the "eggbeater" and "harmonium" are. Without context, there's nothing to build suspense around.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the eggbeater carry the harmonium") makes the writing feel distant and unemotional.

**To improve the suspensefulness, consider:**

* **Clarifying the Language:** Use concrete and familiar words to describe the objects and events.
* **Providing Context:** Introduce the characters and their situation in a way that makes the reader care about what happens to them.
* **Using Active Voice:** Active voice creates a sense of immediacy and urgency.
* **Adding Sensory Details:** Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital to create a more immersive experience.

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The paragraph revolves around a life-or-death situation – a liver transplant. The success or failure of the transplant is clearly important.
