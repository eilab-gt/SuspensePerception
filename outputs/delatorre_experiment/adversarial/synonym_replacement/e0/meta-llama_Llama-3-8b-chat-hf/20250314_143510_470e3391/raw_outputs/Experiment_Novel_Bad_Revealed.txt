I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which creates a sense of tension and anticipation.
* The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The description of the medical team's efforts to save Robert's life creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about whether they will be able to succeed.
* The introduction of the uncertainty about whether Robert will survive the wait for the transplant adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created a stronger sense of emotional connection with the characters, particularly Robert and his medical team.
* Built up the tension and suspense more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome (Robert's death) so quickly.
* Included more vivid and descriptive language to paint a more vivid picture in the reader's mind.
* Created a sense of mystery or intrigue, such as by hinting at the circumstances surrounding the damage to the organ or the events leading up to Robert's death.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively sets the stage for a suspenseful story, but it could be even more effective with some additional attention to building tension and suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is very short and lacks context, making it difficult to understand what's happening or why it's suspenseful.
* The use of technical terms like "chopper" and "ceiling of the infirmary" creates a sense of detachment and doesn't engage the reader emotionally.
* The description of Robert's status as "vital merely static" is unclear and doesn't convey a sense of urgency or danger.
* There is no build-up of tension or suspense, and the paragraph simply presents a series of facts without creating any sense of anticipation or curiosity.

To make this paragraph more suspenseful, the writer could:

* Provide more context about what's happening and why it's important.
* Use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind.
* Create a sense of tension or urgency by hinting at the consequences of Robert's condition.
* Build up the suspense by introducing obstacles or challenges that the medical team must overcome.
