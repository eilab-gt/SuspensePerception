I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is necessary but not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of Henry Martyn Robert Bent and the medical team is a good start, but it's not until the mention of the liver transplantation and the critical condition of the patient that the tension starts to build.
* The revelation that a donor organ has been found and is expected to arrive adds to the sense of urgency, but the phrase "they live non sure if Henry m. robert would last the waiting" is a bit vague and doesn't quite convey the same level of tension as it could.
* The final sentence, "This be the story of what happened," feels like a bit of a non-sequitur and doesn't really add to the suspense.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating a sense of tension, but it could benefit from a bit more attention to pacing and plot development to really make it suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The use of the phrase "at 08: lvii" creates a sense of specificity and precision, which can be effective in building tension.
* The image of the "eggbeater" carrying the "electric organ" is unusual and attention-grabbing, and the fact that it's bringing it down to the infirmary suggests that something important is about to happen.

However, the paragraph is a bit short and lacks a clear sense of what's at stake or what's going to happen next. The language is also a bit unusual and may be off-putting to some readers.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The sudden introduction of a chopper and the falling of two pieces from it creates a sense of sudden and unexpected action, which is a hallmark of suspenseful writing.
* The fact that one of the pieces is a "humble blue sky electric refrigerator" is an unexpected and intriguing twist, and the fact that it's storing a "full functioning liver" raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.
* The use of the phrase "in the material body of a casing" adds a sense of mystery and raises questions about what's happening and what's going to happen next.
* The fact that the liver is "full functioning" implies that it's a vital organ, and the fact that it's being transported in a refrigerator suggests that it's being kept alive or preserved in some way, which adds to the sense of tension and suspense.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is a bit short and lacks a clear sense of what's at stake or what's going to happen next. However, the sudden and unexpected introduction of the chopper and the refrigerator, combined with the mysterious and urgent tone, make for a very suspenseful paragraph.
