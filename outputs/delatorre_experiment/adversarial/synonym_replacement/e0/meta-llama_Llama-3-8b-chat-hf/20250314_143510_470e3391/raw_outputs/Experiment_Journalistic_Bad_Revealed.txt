I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a serious and somber tone, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The use of specific details, such as the date, time, and location, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The introduction of the protagonist, Robert Bent, and the medical team creates a sense of tension and urgency, as the reader is aware that a life-or-death situation is unfolding.
* The uncertainty surrounding Robert's survival and the potential failure of the liver transplant creates suspense and raises questions in the reader's mind.
* The sudden and unexpected twist at the end, where the harmonium (presumably the organ used for the transplant) sustains damage in transportation, is a surprise that adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and suspense more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome at the beginning.
* Provided more context and backstory about Robert's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and create a sense of atmosphere.
* Avoided using phrases like "This follow the storey of what find" which disrupts the flow of the narrative and feels like a non-sequitur.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys a sense of suspense, but could be even more effective with some further refinement.
