I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing a critical medical situation and the urgency of the situation, but it doesn't quite deliver on the suspenseful payoff. The language is straightforward and lacks vivid descriptions or unexpected twists that would keep the reader on the edge of their seat. The paragraph is more informative and factual, providing background information on the event, rather than building suspense or creating a sense of uncertainty.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation by describing a critical moment in the story, and the use of words like "decisive" and "unchanging" implies that the outcome is uncertain. The sentence structure is also somewhat unusual, with the use of "08: lvii" instead of a more conventional time format, which adds to the sense of unease. However, the paragraph is still somewhat vague and doesn't provide enough context or detail to fully engage the reader. The use of made-up words like "eggbeater" and "harmonium" also detracts from the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.

The paragraph creates a sense of unease and tension by describing a unexpected and unusual arrival, and the use of words like "belittled" and "bluing" adds to the sense of mystery. The image of a small blue refrigerator being carried in by one of the people from the chopper is also quite vivid and unusual, which grabs the reader's attention. The fact that the refrigerator is described as being in the form of a display case, and that it contains a full functioning liver, implies that something strange and potentially sinister is going on. The paragraph raises more questions than it answers, which keeps the reader engaged and curious. However, the language is still somewhat awkward and unclear in places, which prevents the paragraph from being truly "very suspensful".
