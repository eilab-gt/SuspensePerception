I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the urgency of the situation and the uncertainty of the outcome. The use of phrases such as "impending liver transplant", "wait the arrival of the electronic organ", and "decisive situation" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind about what will happen next.

However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of suspense because it does not create a sense of danger or threat. The situation is described as "decisive", but it is not clear what the consequences of failure would be. Additionally, the outcome of the transplant is described as successful, which reduces the sense of tension and suspense.

Overall, the paragraph is more informative and descriptive than suspenseful, and it does not have a strong narrative drive or a sense of danger or uncertainty that would keep the reader engaged and curious about what will happen next.

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation by describing the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, which is a crucial moment in the story. The use of the phrase "decisive simply static consideration" suggests that Henry's situation is critical and that the arrival of the organ is a make-or-break moment.

The reader is not given much to go on, and the paragraph relies heavily on the reader's prior knowledge of the situation. Additionally, the paragraph is quite short and lacks a strong narrative drive, which reduces its overall suspensefulness.
