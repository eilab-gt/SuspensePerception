I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is necessary but not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of Henry Martyn Robert Bent and the medical team is a good start, but it's not until the mention of the liver transplantation and the critical condition of the patient that the tension begins to build.
* The revelation that a donor organ has been found and is expected to arrive adds to the sense of urgency, but the phrase "they live non sure if Henry m. robert would last the waiting" is a bit vague and doesn't quite convey the same level of tension as it could.
* The final sentence, "This be the story of what happened," feels like a bit of a non-sequitur and doesn't really add to the suspense.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating a sense of tension, but it could benefit from a bit more attention to pacing and plot development to really make it suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The sudden introduction of a chopper and the falling of two pieces from it creates a sense of sudden and unexpected action, which is a hallmark of suspenseful writing.
