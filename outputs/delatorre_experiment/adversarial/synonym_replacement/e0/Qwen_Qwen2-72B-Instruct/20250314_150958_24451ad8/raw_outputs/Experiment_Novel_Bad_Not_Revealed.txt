The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a child awaiting a liver transplant and the uncertainty of whether he will survive until the organ arrives. The use of specific details, such as the date and location, adds to the realism and tension of the situation. However, the paragraph does not build up the suspense in a particularly dramatic way, and the outcome is not yet revealed, leaving the reader in a state of anticipation rather than intense suspense. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph increases the suspense by introducing a time element and the critical condition of the patient, Henry Martyn Robert, while the helicopter carrying the organ has just landed. The use of specific time ("08:57") adds a sense of urgency, and the description of Henry's condition as "vital but static" implies that his situation is precarious and could change at any moment. The fact that the organ has arrived but has not yet been transplanted also adds to the tension. I would rate this paragraph a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense by providing a vivid, detailed scene of the organ's arrival and the urgency of the situation.

The use of body language to communicate urgency and the focus on the ticking clock (the watch on the wrist) further intensify the suspense. I would rate this paragraph an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
