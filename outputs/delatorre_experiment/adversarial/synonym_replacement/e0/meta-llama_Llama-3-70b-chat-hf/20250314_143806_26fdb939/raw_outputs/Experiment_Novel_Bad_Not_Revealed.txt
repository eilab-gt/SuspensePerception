I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a dramatic and intense situation, with a young boy's life hanging in the balance as he waits for a liver transplant. The use of specific details, such as the date and time, adds a sense of realism and urgency. The phrase "his life cost vital" creates a sense of tension and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Henry survive?" and "What will happen next?"

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by the fact that it's presented as a "tale of a real consequence" and the reader is told upfront that they are about to read a news report of what happened. This framing device takes away some of the uncertainty and surprise that is typically associated with suspenseful storytelling. Additionally, the paragraph's tone is more informative and matter-of-fact than suspenseful or thrilling, which also reduces the overall sense of tension.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is very effective in creating suspense because it:

* Uses a specific and dramatic event (the helicopter landing) to create a sense of urgency and tension
* Creates a sense of proximity to the action, with the use of a specific time (08:57) and a vivid description of the helicopter landing on the hospital roof
* Raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the organ arrive in time?" and "Will Henry Robert survive?"
* Uses words like "vital" and "static" to create a sense of gravity and uncertainty around Henry Robert's condition

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still somewhat straightforward and lacks a sense of surprise or unexpected twist. The reader is expecting the helicopter to arrive with the organ, and it does, so there's no major surprise or revelation. However, the paragraph still does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of urgency, making it very suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is not suspenseful for several reasons:

* The scene is mundane and ordinary, with a cleaner going about their daily routine
* The language is descriptive, but it's used to create a sense of normalcy and routine, rather than tension or suspense
* The paragraph focuses on the cleaner's thoughts and feelings, which are positive and relaxed (he finds the job "agreeable" and whistles as he works)
* There is no sense of urgency, danger, or conflict in the paragraph
* The paragraph is slow-paced and lacks any sense of surprise or unexpected events

The only potential source of suspense in the paragraph is the fact that the cleaner doesn't put out "wet floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident. However, this is not emphasized or played up in the paragraph, and the overall tone is still very relaxed and routine. Overall, the paragraph is more focused on creating a sense of everyday normalcy than on building suspense.
