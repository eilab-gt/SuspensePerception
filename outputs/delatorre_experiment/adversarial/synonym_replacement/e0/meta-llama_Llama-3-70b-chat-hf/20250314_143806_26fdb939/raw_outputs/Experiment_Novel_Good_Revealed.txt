I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation by introducing a life-or-death scenario (a liver transplant) and creating tension by mentioning that the patient's situation is "decisive" and that he may not survive the wait. The use of specific details like the date, time, and location adds to the sense of realism and raises the stakes.

However, the paragraph also gives away the outcome of the story by stating that the transplant was successful and the liver is functioning correctly. This reduces the suspense and makes the reader feel that the story is more of a straightforward account of events rather than a thrilling narrative.

To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could end with a cliffhanger, such as "But just as they were about to begin the surgery, disaster struck..." or "As they waited for the donor organ to arrive, Robert's condition began to deteriorate..." This would leave the reader wondering what would happen next and make them more invested in the story.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is very effective in creating suspense because it:

* Creates a sense of urgency with the specific time "08:57"
* Introduces a dramatic and intense image with the "whirlybird" (helicopter) carrying the organ
* Emphasizes the critical nature of the situation with the phrase "decisive simply static consideration", implying that Robert's life is hanging in the balance
* Ends with a sense of anticipation, as the reader is left wondering if the organ will arrive in time and if the transplant will be successful

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that it's a relatively short paragraph, and the suspense is somewhat contained within a single sentence. A longer paragraph with more build-up and tension could potentially be even more suspenseful. Nonetheless, this paragraph does an excellent job of creating a sense of urgency and tension, making the reader want to keep reading to find out what happens next.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is masterfully crafted to create a sense of tension and suspense. Here's why:

* The description of the helicopter and the men descending from it is vivid and immersive, putting the reader in the midst of the action.
* The introduction of the liver, stored in a "puritanical casing" at a precise temperature, raises the stakes and emphasizes the importance of the mission.
* The use of sensory details like the "whirlwind of the spinning blade" and the men's hair being blown back creates a sense of urgency and chaos.
* The fact that one of the men says something inaudible adds to the sense of mystery and tension.
* The gestures and body language of the men, such as the nod and the pointing, create a sense of silent communication and add to the sense of urgency.
* The mention of the patient's "vital situation" and the need to avoid wasting time raises the stakes and creates a sense of ticking clock.
* The paragraph ends with a sense of movement and action, as the men hurry towards the exit, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.

Overall, this paragraph is a masterclass in building suspense through descriptive language, sensory details, and clever plotting. It's a page-turner that leaves the reader breathless and eager to find out what happens next.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is quite the opposite of suspenseful. Here's why:

* The description of the janitor's mundane task of mopping the stairs is detailed and slow-paced, which creates a sense of monotony and routine.
* The use of phrases like "it wasn't a particularly interesting job" and "it was an agreeable line" reinforces the idea that nothing exciting or suspenseful is happening.
* The description of the stairwell as "dull" and the lack of windows adds to the sense of blandness and lack of tension.
* The janitor's whistling and friendly interactions with doctors and patients create a sense of normalcy and calmness.
* The fact that the stairwell is never dirty and the janitor finishes his task quickly and efficiently adds to the sense of routine and lack of drama.
* The paragraph ends with the janitor continuing his "distinctive working day", which implies that nothing out of the ordinary is going to happen.

Overall, this paragraph is a great example of how to create a sense of normalcy and routine, but it's not suspenseful at all. It's a slow-burning, descriptive passage that sets the scene for a story, but it doesn't create any tension or anticipation.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous one, and here's why:

* The description of the helipad exit and the service stairwell creates a sense of urgency and importance, as the reader knows that the liver transplant is time-sensitive.
* The mention of the "cardinal archives" and "main storage room" creates a sense of institutional importance, which adds to the sense of gravity.
* The introduction of the east wing lift creates a sense of possibility and tension, as the reader wonders if the characters will take the lift or not.
* The conversation between the two men creates a sense of urgency and tension, as they discuss the best way to get to the patient quickly.
* The phrase "it's not worth taking the lift" implies that time is of the essence, and that every second counts.
* The decision to take the stairs instead of the lift creates a sense of physical tension and urgency, as the reader imagines the characters hurrying down the stairs.

However, the paragraph is not a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness because:

* The conversation between the two men is relatively calm and matter-of-fact, which reduces the sense of tension and urgency.
* The description of the corridor and the service stairwell is still somewhat detailed and slow-paced, which slows down the pace of the paragraph.
* The paragraph doesn't end with a cliffhanger or a dramatic twist, which reduces the sense of suspense and anticipation.

Overall, this paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous one, but it could be even more effective with a faster pace, more dramatic language, and a more intense sense of urgency.
