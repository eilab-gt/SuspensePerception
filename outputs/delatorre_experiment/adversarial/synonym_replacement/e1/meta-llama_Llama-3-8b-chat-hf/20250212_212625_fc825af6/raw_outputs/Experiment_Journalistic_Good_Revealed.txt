I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is immediately aware that something serious is happening and that the outcome is uncertain.
* The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The description of Henry's condition and the urgency of the situation creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Henry survive?" and "Will the transplant be successful?"
* The use of phrases like "all were quick for his impendent liver transplant" and "they were not trusted if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of tension and foreboding.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more of a sense of mystery or surprise. As it is, the reader is told from the beginning that Henry is receiving a liver transplant, which reduces the sense of surprise and tension.
* Built up the stakes more gradually. The paragraph jumps right into the situation without much buildup, which makes it feel a bit abrupt.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to create a sense of atmosphere and tension. The writing is clear and concise, but it's not particularly evocative or engaging.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the sense of urgency and tension surrounding Henry's transplant. However, it could be even more effective with a few tweaks to create a greater sense of suspense and surprise.
