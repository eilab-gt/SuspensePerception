I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is necessary but not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of Henry Martyn Robert Bent and the medical team is a good start, but it's not until the mention of the liver transplantation and the critical condition of the patient that the tension begins to build.
* The revelation that a donor organ has been found and is expected to arrive adds to the sense of urgency, but the phrase "they live non sure if Henry m. robert would last the waiting" is a bit vague and doesn't quite convey the same level of tension as it could.
* The final sentence, "This be the story of what happened," feels like a bit of a non-sequitur and doesn't really add to the suspense.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating a sense of tension, but it could benefit from more specific and detailed descriptions of the events to come, as well as a more dramatic or unexpected twist to really hook the reader.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The use of a specific and unusual time, "08: lvii", creates a sense of precision and adds to the tension.
* The phrase "the eggbeater carry the electric organ bring down duly on the cap of the infirmary" is quite vivid and creates a sense of anticipation. The use of the word "eggbeater" is unexpected and adds to the sense of unease.
* The fact that Henry Martyn Robert Bent is in a "decisive merely unchanging shape" implies that something critical is about to happen, and the use of the word "decisive" adds to the sense of urgency.

However, the paragraph is not as suspenseful as it could be because:

* The language is quite poetic and abstract, which can make it harder to follow and less engaging.
* The sentence structure is a bit awkward, which can disrupt the flow of the narrative.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The sudden introduction of a chopper and the falling of two pieces creates a sense of shock and surprise, which is a key element of suspense.
* The description of one of the pieces as a "humble blue sky electric refrigerator" is unexpected and adds to the sense of unease. The use of the word "humble" is particularly effective in making the reader feel like something ordinary is about to become extraordinary.
* The fact that the refrigerator is described as being in the "material body of a casing" implies that it contains something important, and the use of the word "casing" adds to the sense of mystery.
* The final phrase, "which store the in full functioning liver", is the most suspenseful part of the paragraph. The use of the word "store" implies that the liver is being transported, and the fact that it is "in full functioning" implies that it is a vital organ. The reader is left wondering what will happen to the liver and why it is being transported in such a way.

The only reason I wouldn't give this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that it is a bit short and doesn't provide much context or background information. The reader is left with many questions, such as what is happening to the liver, why is it being transported in a refrigerator, and what will happen to the people involved. However, the paragraph is effective in creating a sense of suspense and intrigue, and the reader is left wanting to know more.
