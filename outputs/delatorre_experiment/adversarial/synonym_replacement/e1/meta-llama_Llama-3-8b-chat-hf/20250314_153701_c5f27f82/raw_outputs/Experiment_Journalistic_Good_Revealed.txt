I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is immediately aware that something serious is happening and that the outcome is uncertain.
* The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The description of Henry's condition and the urgency of the situation creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Henry survive?" and "Will the transplant be successful?"
* The use of phrases like "all quiet for his impendent liver transplant" and "not trusted if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of tension and foreboding.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more of a sense of mystery or surprise. As it is, the reader is told from the beginning that Henry is undergoing a liver transplant, which reduces the sense of surprise or uncertainty.
* Built up the tension more gradually. The paragraph jumps right into the situation without much buildup or foreshadowing, which makes it feel a bit abrupt.
* Used more vivid or evocative language to describe the scene and the characters' emotions. The writing is clear and concise, but it's not particularly descriptive or engaging.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the sense of urgency and tension surrounding Henry's transplant. However, it could be even more effective with a bit more attention to building suspense and creating a sense of mystery or surprise.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is very short and lacks context, which makes it difficult to understand what's happening or why it's suspenseful.
* The use of technical terms like "whirlybird" and "pipe organ" is unclear and doesn't add to the sense of tension or suspense.
* The phrase "vital simply unchanging precondition" is vague and doesn't convey any sense of urgency or danger.
* The paragraph lacks any sense of character or emotional investment, which makes it hard to care about what's happening to Henry.

* Provide more context about what's happening and why it's important.
* Use more descriptive language to create a sense of atmosphere or tension.
* Introduce a sense of danger or uncertainty to raise the stakes.
* Create a sense of character or emotional investment by describing Henry's thoughts or feelings.

As it stands, the paragraph is very short and lacks any real sense of suspense or tension.

I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is still quite short and lacks context, which makes it difficult to understand what's happening or why it's suspenseful.
* The use of technical terms like "whirlybird" and "pocket size blue devil electric refrigerator" is still unclear and doesn't add to the sense of tension or suspense.
* The phrase "soma of a font" is unclear and doesn't convey any sense of urgency or danger.
* The mention of a "full functioning liver" is somewhat ominous, but it's not clear why it's significant or what's at stake.

However, this paragraph is slightly more suspenseful than the previous one because:

* It introduces a new element (the pocket size blue devil electric refrigerator) that raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "What is this device?" and "Why is it important?"
* The use of the word "devil" in the name of the refrigerator adds a hint of menace or danger, which could be developed further.
