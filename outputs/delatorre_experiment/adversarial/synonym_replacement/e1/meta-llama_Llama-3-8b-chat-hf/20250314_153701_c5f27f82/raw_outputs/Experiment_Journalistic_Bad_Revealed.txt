I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a serious and somber tone, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The use of specific details, such as the date, time, and location, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The introduction of the protagonist, Robert Bent, and the medical team creates a sense of tension and urgency, as the reader is aware that a life-or-death situation is unfolding.
* The revelation that the liver transplant is imminent and that Robert's condition is critical raises the stakes and creates suspense.
* The unexpected twist at the end, where the harmonium (presumably the organ used for the transplant) is damaged in transportation and the transplant is unable to proceed, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and suspense more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome at the beginning.
* Provided more context and backstory about Robert's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and create a sense of atmosphere.
* Added more emotional resonance to the story, such as the reactions of the medical team and Robert's family to the tragic outcome.

Overall, while the paragraph is engaging and suspenseful, it could be even more effective with some additional attention to building tension and creating a more immersive experience for the reader.
