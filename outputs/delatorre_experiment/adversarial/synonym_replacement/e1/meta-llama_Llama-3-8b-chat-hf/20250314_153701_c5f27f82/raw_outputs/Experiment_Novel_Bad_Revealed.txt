I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which creates a sense of tension and anticipation.
* The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The description of the medical team's efforts to save Robert's life creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about whether they will be able to succeed.
* The introduction of the uncertainty about whether Robert will survive the wait for the transplant adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created a stronger sense of emotional connection with the characters, particularly Robert and his medical team.
* Built up the tension and suspense more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome (Robert's death) so quickly.
* Included more vivid and descriptive language to paint a more vivid picture in the reader's mind.
* Created a sense of mystery or surprise, rather than simply presenting a straightforward narrative.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the story, but it could be even more effective at building suspense and engaging the reader.
