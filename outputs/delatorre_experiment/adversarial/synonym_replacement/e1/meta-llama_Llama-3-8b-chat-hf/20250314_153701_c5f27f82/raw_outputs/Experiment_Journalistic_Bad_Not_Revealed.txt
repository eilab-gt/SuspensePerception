I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is necessary but not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of Henry Martyn Robert Bent and the medical team is a good start, but it's not until the mention of the liver transplantation and the critical condition of the patient that the tension starts to build.
* The revelation that a donor has been found and the team is waiting for the organ to arrive creates a sense of anticipation and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder if Henry will make it in time.
* However, the paragraph ends somewhat abruptly and doesn't really provide a sense of resolution or a cliffhanger, which would make the reader want to keep reading to find out what happens next.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating some tension, but it could be more effective at building suspense and keeping the reader engaged.
