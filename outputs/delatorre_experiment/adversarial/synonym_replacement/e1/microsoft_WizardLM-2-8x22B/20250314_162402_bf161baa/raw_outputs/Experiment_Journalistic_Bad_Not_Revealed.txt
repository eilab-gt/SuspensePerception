This paragraph introduces a moment of action that is critical to the story, which inherently carries some level of suspense. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the description of the helicopter landing on the hospital roof with the organ for transplant creates a sense of urgency. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the clinical and detached tone of the description, as well as the lack of detail about the boy's immediate condition or the potential complications that might arise. The reader is aware that an important event is taking place, but without more context or emotional depth, the suspensefulness is moderate.

This paragraph introduces an unexpected twist with two individuals falling from the helicopter, one of whom is carrying a cooler with the liver inside. The specific and unusual detail of the cooler being described as a "humble blue sky electric refrigerator" adds a layer of intrigue and raises questions about the nature of the incident. The mention of the fully functioning liver suggests the stakes are high, as it is crucial for the boy's survival. This event is sudden and shocking, which elevates the suspense as readers are left to wonder about the fate of the individuals involved, the condition of the liver, and the impact on Henry Martyn Robert Bent's transplant. The suspense is significant due to the potential consequences of this accident.

This paragraph hints at a potential oversight that could have consequences, as the dry cleaner has finished mopping the floor of the available stairwell but neglected to display a "caution wet floor" sign. The mention of the absence of this warning sign introduces an element of risk, as someone could unknowingly enter the stairwell and slip, leading to an accident. The specific mention of the "cockeyed storey" foretoken suggests that this detail is significant and could be part of a larger chain of events. However, the suspense is relatively mild because there is no immediate threat or action unfolding; the reader is left to speculate on the possible implications of this minor negligence.

This paragraph raises the suspense level by presenting a critical and risky situation. The two individuals carrying the life-saving liver are making a decision to use an alternative route—the service stairwell—presumably to expedite their descent from the rooftop. The choice to deviate from the standard protocol suggests urgency and introduces potential danger, as service stairwells are typically not designed for such delicate transport. The reader is left in suspense about whether this decision will lead to a successful and swift delivery of the liver or if it will result in complications. The stakes are high, as any mishap could jeopardize the transplant and Henry Martyn Robert Bent's life. The detail that they are "enraptured" with the liver also adds a sense of gravity and care to the situation, enhancing the suspenseful atmosphere.

This paragraph describes a critical moment where the importance of the task at hand is underscored by the immediate consequence of a misstep. The "eccentric set" (presumably one of the two individuals carrying the liver) dropping the "metrical unit" (which could be a device or part of the equipment related to the liver transport) and the casing containing the liver sliding down the stairwell creates a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be concerned about the condition of the liver post-fall, the potential impact on Henry Martyn Robert Bent's transplant, and the safety of the individuals involved. The use of the word "steep" to describe the descent of the casing suggests a loss of control and a rapid, possibly damaging, event. This incident is a significant plot point that could alter the course of the story, contributing to a strong sense of suspense.

This paragraph introduces a moment of tension where a fellow worker fails to warn a doctor who is distracted by the fountain, which is unguarded. The suspense arises from the potential danger of the unattended fountain and the anticipation of what might happen if someone, particularly a child, were to fall into it. The doctor's inattention due to regaining his balance adds to the sense of imminent peril. The reader is left to imagine the possible consequences of this oversight, which creates a moderate level of suspense. The specific detail about the fountain not being covered from any direction increases the perceived risk and the reader's concern for the safety of those around the fountain, including the doctor himself.

This paragraph, while brief, suggests an immediate response to a situation, which can inherently carry some level of suspense. The reader might infer that the doctor's quick arrival is in response to an urgent need or emergency, which could be related to the previous events described. However, the paragraph itself lacks detailed context and description, which are essential for building suspense. It is more of a transitional statement that sets the stage for an upcoming event rather than a suspenseful moment in itself. The reader is left to anticipate what will happen next once the doctor arrives, but without additional information, the suspense generated by this sentence alone is relatively low.

This paragraph introduces a significant and unexpected development that elevates the suspense. The discovery that the "home bagful" (presumably containing the liver) has burst open upon opening the eccentric (which could refer to a container or the individual's peculiar behavior) creates a sense of urgency and concern. The burst bag suggests potential damage to the liver or a compromise in its viability, which directly impacts the life-saving transplant that Henry Martyn Robert Bent desperately needs. The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the liver, the implications for the surgery, and how the medical team will respond to this critical setback. The specific and dramatic nature of the event contributes to a high level of suspense.

This paragraph presents a moment of medical decision-making that carries a degree of suspense. The transport of the case (presumably containing the liver) to the hepatic testing ground for evaluation suggests that there is uncertainty about the organ's condition, likely due to the previous incident where the home bagful was found to be burst. The operating surgeon's intention to perform a biopsy to assess the liver's status indicates that the medical team is dealing with a potentially complex situation. The reader is left to wonder about the results of the biopsy and whether the liver is still suitable for transplantation. The suspense is moderate because the paragraph sets up a scenario where critical information is about to be revealed, but the outcome remains uncertain. The clinical language and focus on procedure also create a sense of detachment that can slightly reduce the emotional impact and thus the level of suspense.

This paragraph delivers a significant and suspenseful twist in the narrative. The revelation that the liver, referred to as "the hammond organ," cannot be used for the graft due to its having experienced a shock, creates a high-stakes moment of tension. The term "shock" suggests that the liver has been compromised in a way that affects its viability for transplantation, which is a critical setback given Henry Martyn Robert Bent's urgent need for a new liver. The reader is left with a cliffhanger regarding the boy's fate, as the failure of the organ to be suitable for transplant raises immediate life-or-death stakes. The suspense is heightened by the finality of the statement that it is "out of the question" to use the liver, leaving the reader to anxiously await the next development in the story.

This paragraph delivers a powerful and emotionally charged conclusion to the narrative, confirming the worst-case scenario and the tragic outcome for Henry Martyn Robert Bent. The specificity of the time (twenty-one: twenty-six) adds a sense of finality to the events, as the medical team acknowledges Henry's death. The detail that the liver could not be used due to the damage it sustained in transit creates a profound sense of loss and raises questions about the circumstances that led to this outcome. The suspense builds throughout the story with each subsequent complication, and this final paragraph resolves the tension with a deeply impactful and sorrowful event. The reader is left to grapple with the gravity of the situation and the irreversible consequences of the liver's damage, making this paragraph very suspenseful.
