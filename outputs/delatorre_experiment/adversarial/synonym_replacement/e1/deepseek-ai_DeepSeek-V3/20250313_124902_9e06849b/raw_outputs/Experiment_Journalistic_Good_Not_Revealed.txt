I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a potentially tense situation with a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The mention of uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait adds some tension.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The writing is somewhat unclear and contains grammatical errors, which detracts from the suspense. Additionally, the paragraph lacks vivid details or emotional depth that could heighten the tension. The phrase "This is the write up of what happen" feels abrupt and doesn't build anticipation effectively.

Overall, while the situation itself is inherently suspenseful, the execution doesn't fully capitalize on its potential.

- **Weaknesses**: The writing is still unclear in places (e.g., "unmatchable of whom be comport a belittled bluing electric refrigerator"), which detracts from the suspense.
