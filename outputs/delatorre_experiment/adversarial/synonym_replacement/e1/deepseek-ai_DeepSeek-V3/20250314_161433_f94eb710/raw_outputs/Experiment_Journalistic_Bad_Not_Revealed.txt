I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait adds tension. The specific details (date, location, and the critical condition of the patient) ground the story in reality, which can heighten suspense.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the clinical tone and lack of immediate action or emotional depth. The paragraph feels more like an introduction to a story rather than a moment of heightened tension. Additionally, the grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("What you be about to record exist the tale") detract from the overall impact.

Overall, it has potential for suspense but could be more engaging with sharper writing and a focus on immediate, emotional stakes.
