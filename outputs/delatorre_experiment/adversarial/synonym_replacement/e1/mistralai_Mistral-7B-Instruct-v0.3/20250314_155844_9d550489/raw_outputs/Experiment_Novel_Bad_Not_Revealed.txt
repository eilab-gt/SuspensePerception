The setting and the impending liver transplant create a sense of urgency and tension, and the uncertainty about the donor and Henry's condition keeps the reader engaged. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the challenges or obstacles that Henry and the medical team face during the waiting period.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. The use of the word "whirlybird" and the setting of the helicopter landing at the hospital creates a sense of urgency, but the paragraph lacks details about the condition of Henry or the significance of the organ.

 I would rate this paragraph as an 8 on the suspensefulness scale. The use of vivid imagery and action, such as the helicopter's rotor and the men rushing to unload the organ, creates a sense of urgency and tension. The paragraph also creates suspense by withholding information about the patient's condition and the reason for the urgency.

As the helicopter's rotor blades whirred overhead, two men rushed out, their hair blown back by the wind. One of them clutched a precious cargo, a compatible liver kept at a temperature of four degrees centigrade, the last hope for a critically ill patient. The other man shouted something unintelligible, but his companion couldn't hear him over the noise of the blades. He tapped his fellow worker on the shoulder, pointing at his watch and then at the edge of the roof. The man nodded and, still crouching low, made his way towards the edge of the building, the case in his hands. They were told that the patient was in a critical condition and there was no time to waste. Every second counted as they raced against time to save a life.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes a routine cleaning job and does not create a sense of urgency or tension. To increase suspense, the paragraph could focus on the cleaner's discovery of something unusual or unexpected in the hospital, or introduce a plot twist related to the liver transplant that is happening simultaneously. 1. Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the inspection and repair stairwell. Like every morning, he started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital's eight floors. It wasn't a particularly interesting job. The help stairwell had no window and the only spot of color on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguisher, which was always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. Cleaning the corridor was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a world-weary patient happy to have a chat. Overall, it was an agreeable job. However, the service stairwell wasn't dirty: the staff used the lifts operating theater any of the three stairways distributed in the building's wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean and polish. As he whistled his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucketful, and a cloth hanging from his belt, he didn't bother to put up "wet floor" warning signs at the top of each section. That morning, like every daybreak, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, got in the cleaning cart, and continued his typical workday. Suddenly, as he rounded a corner, he stumbled upon a scene that would change everything.

The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now slick with rain, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing was another door that opened onto one of the hospital's secondary corridors. This corridor housed the main archives, the storage room, and the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. At the end of the corridor was the east wing elevator. The man carrying the case approached the door, just about to enter the corridor, when he noticed his colleague's hesitation. "The patient is on the sixth floor. It's not worth waiting for the elevator," he said, realizing his colleague's intention. "By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it'll take longer than walking down two flights of stairs." His colleague shrugged and turned away from the door, clutching the ropes of the service stairwell with his free hand. The tension was palpable as they raced against time to save a life.

His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. With his other foot already in the air, he couldn't catch himself. Without thinking, he reached out to grab onto the railing with his free hand, letting go of the case. The man tumbled down the stairs while his colleague managed to catch himself and regain his balance. The two men watched in horror as the case spun out of control, making a noise that sounded like a bag of loose marbles being shaken. The fate of the organ was uncertain as the medical team raced to retrieve it before it was damaged beyond repair. Every second counted as they worked against the clock to save a life.

In the end, the case landed on its side and stopped. Three seconds later, the two men knelt beside it, looking at each other. The man who had been in charge of the organ reached out his arm to pick it up, but his colleague warned him, "Don't! We don't know if it's been damaged. It's best to call the doctors." The other nodded, pulling his hand back. "I'll go, " the first said. "You stay here and watch it, in case anyone comes." Without wasting any time, he turned and sprinted down the stairs, taking care not to slip. He reached the second floor and moved through the door into the hospital. He rushed through the complex network of corridors until he reached the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. Every second counted as they worked against the clock to save a life.

Meanwhile, keeping a firm grip on the railing, his colleague remained motionless. He was trying to think of anything except the possible damage that the contents of the package might have suffered from the fall. His ankle hurt, and he was leaning heavily on his injured leg, while the other man was barely breathing. Despite the pain in his neck, the man had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstitious notion that the fate of that liver in some way depended on the pain he was able to endure in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Suddenly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. "Move aside, please," one of the doctors asked, kneeling down next to the case.

He heard a click when the doctor pressed the release button with his thumbs. It popped open, the outer flap opening to reveal a small refrigerated cooler. After a brief examination of the doctor's face, the man closed the pillowcase. The cooler door swung open with a thud, and there, on one side, was a fragile current of refrigerated air slowly escaping. The medical team breathed a sigh of relief as they saw that the organ was intact. Every second counted as they worked against the clock to save a life.

According to the initial diagnosis, the organ was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where it was removed for examination. The surface of the liver appeared to be in good condition. The enzyme activity was sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To determine this, it was necessary to perform a clear puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. With his nerves covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon some space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the needle located approximately halfway down the remaining lobe of the liver. The man felt decidedly nervous. He had performed numerous biopsies before, but never before had a child's life been hanging in the balance. If he missed one mm, he would damage the organ irreparably. The tension was palpable as the medical team worked against the clock to save a life.

Holding his breath, the man inserted the needle one centimeter. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully withdrew the syringe. One quarter of the syringe filled with a clear liquid, which he handed to his colleague. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague placed two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The operating surgeon lowered his mask and peered down the tube. As he examined the sample, he occasionally pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. After an agonizing half hour, the man moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleague, who was anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact. The tension was palpable as the medical team raced against time to find a replacement organ and save the patient's life.
