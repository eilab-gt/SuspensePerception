I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a "veridical case" and a medical emergency immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly life-or-death, with Robert needing a liver transplant urgently.
* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding Robert's survival, stating that "they be not certain if Henry martyn robert would exist the wait."

**However, it lacks some key elements that would elevate the suspense:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While Robert's condition is critical, the paragraph doesn't present any immediate, tangible danger. We don't know what specific complications he's facing.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was found," "be not certain") makes the writing feel less immediate and engaging.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the situation rather than showing us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspense, the author could:**

* Introduce a ticking clock element (e.g., the organ is only viable for a limited time).
* Describe Robert's physical and emotional state in more detail.
* Include dialogue that reveals the tension and fear among the medical team.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of a helicopter carrying an organ at a specific time creates a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Medical Context:** The mention of a "decisive just unchanging status" suggests a critical situation, raising questions about Robert's condition.

**However, it falls short in several areas:**

* **Unclear Stakes:** We don't know enough about Robert's condition or the significance of the organ transplant. 
* **Awkward Phrasing:** The sentence structure is clunky and difficult to follow. Phrases like "whirlybird bear the harmonium shoot down duly" are confusing and detract from the suspense.
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** The paragraph is devoid of any emotional connection to Robert or the medical team. We don't feel their anxiety or hope.

**To improve the suspense, the author could:**

* **Clarify the stakes:** Explain why the organ transplant is so crucial for Robert's survival.
* **Use more vivid language:** Replace vague phrases with concrete details that create a stronger sense of urgency and tension.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the reactions of those around him.
* **Focus on character:** Give us a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of Robert or a member of the medical team.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

**Strengths:**

* **High Stakes:** The urgency of the situation is clear – a life-saving liver is being transported, and time is of the essence.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the helicopter's rotors, the wind, and the blue case creates a vivid and somewhat tense atmosphere.
* **Action:** The men's movements and the ticking clock (the watch) add a sense of forward momentum and urgency.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Awkward Phrasing:** The language is stilted and unnatural in places ("oral sex down," "so at the doorway off the roof"). This detracts from the flow and suspense.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the tension or anxiety of the men involved.  
* **Unclear Stakes:** While we know the liver is important, we don't know enough about the patient's condition or the potential consequences of delay.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Refine the Language:** Use more natural and precise language to create a smoother reading experience.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the urgency, describe the men's actions and expressions to convey their sense of pressure.
* **Focus on Character:** Give us a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of one of the men. What are they thinking about as they transport the liver?

I'd rate this paragraph a **1 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting and Routine:** The entire paragraph focuses on a very ordinary and repetitive task – cleaning a service stairwell. There's nothing inherently exciting or threatening about this activity.
* **Lack of Conflict or Tension:** There are no obstacles, challenges, or surprises for the cleaner to overcome. Everything proceeds as expected.
* **Passive Voice and Telling:** The writing relies heavily on passive voice and telling rather than showing. We're told the job is boring and uneventful, but we don't experience it through any vivid descriptions or sensory details.

**To make this paragraph more suspenseful, the author could:**

* **Introduce an Unexpected Element:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual in the stairwell, like a hidden room, a strange message, or a suspicious object.
* **Create a Sense of Unease:**  Use sensory details to build a creepy or unsettling atmosphere.  Describe strange noises, flickering lights, or a feeling of being watched.
* **Hint at a Larger Threat:**  Subtly suggest that something dangerous is happening in the hospital, even if it's not directly related to the cleaner's task.
