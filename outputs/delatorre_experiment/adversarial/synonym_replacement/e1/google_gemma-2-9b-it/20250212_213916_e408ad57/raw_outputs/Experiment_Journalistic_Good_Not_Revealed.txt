I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a liver transplant creates immediate interest.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The sentence "This is the write up of what happen" leaves the reader wanting to know what happened to Robert.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very general. We don't know why Robert's situation is so critical, what the risks are, or any details about the medical team or the donor. 
* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's emotional state:**  Describe his fear, hope, or desperation.
* **Highlight the ticking clock:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation and the limited time Robert has.
* **Introduce a conflict or obstacle:** Perhaps there's a complication with the donor organ, or a sudden change in Robert's condition.
* **Use more vivid language and sensory details:**  Instead of saying "they were not trusted," describe the fear and uncertainty in the medical team's eyes.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Unclear Meaning:** The language is highly unusual and difficult to understand.  "Eggbeater," "harmonium," and "decisive simply unchanging consideration" are not typical medical terms and create confusion rather than intrigue.
