I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a pending organ transplant immediately grabs the reader's attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The paragraph clearly establishes the high stakes involved – Henry's life hangs in the balance.
* **Lack of Detail:**  The paragraph is very general. We don't know *why* Henry's condition is critical, what specific challenges they face, or any hints about what might go wrong. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Henry's situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the hospital atmosphere, Henry's appearance, the sounds of the medical equipment.
* **Focus on character emotions:** Show the fear, hope, and desperation of the medical team and Henry's family.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Introduce a small detail that suggests something might go wrong with the transplant.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Elements:** The mention of an "electric organ" and the specific time create a sense of mystery and urgency.

* **Awkward Phrasing:** The sentence structure is clunky and grammatically incorrect, which detracts from the overall effect.
