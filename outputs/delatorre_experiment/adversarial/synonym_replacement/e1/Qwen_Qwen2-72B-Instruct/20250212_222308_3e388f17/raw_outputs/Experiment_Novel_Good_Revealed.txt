The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, primarily due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the liver transplant for the eight-year-old boy, Robert Hang. The details about the event being real and the critical nature of the situation add to the tension. The fact that they were unsure if Robert would survive the wait for the organ also heightens the suspense. The resolution of the story, where it is confirmed that the liver is functioning correctly, provides a relief from the suspense but is not included in the suspense rating. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for its level of suspense.

The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. The use of precise timing ("08:57") and the critical condition of the patient ("decisive but static condition") creates a sense of urgency and tension. The fact that the helicopter carrying the organ has arrived adds to the suspense, as the success of the transplant still hangs in the balance. The unusual detail of the helicopter landing on the hospital roof also adds to the dramatic effect. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for its level of suspense. However, if the reader is particularly invested in the outcome of the transplant, the rating could be higher, around a 7. Overall, I would rate it a 6.5. Since we can't give half points, I'll round it down to a 6.
