The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a child awaiting a liver transplant and the uncertainty of whether he will survive until the organ arrives. The use of specific details, such as the date and location, adds to the realism and tension of the scenario. However, the paragraph does not build on this tension or provide any cliffhangers, which could have increased the suspense. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph has a high level of suspense, but it is more of a resolution with a tragic outcome rather than building tension. The announcement of Henry's death and the reason for the failed liver transplantation create a sense of finality and loss, which can be emotionally impactful. The use of the specific time ("21:26") adds to the immediacy of the situation. However, since the outcome is presented as a conclusion rather than a cliffhanger or a sudden twist, the suspense is more in the form of emotional impact rather than uncertainty. I would rate it an 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph delivers a significant and tragic resolution to the story, which can be considered very suspenseful in terms of emotional impact, but it does not build tension in the traditional sense of suspense.
