I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a potentially dramatic and life-or-death situation, which is inherently suspenseful. The use of phrases like "imminent liver graft" and "his condition was critical" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert survive?" and "Will the transplant be successful?"

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by its dry, matter-of-fact tone and the lack of emotional investment in the characters. The writing is clear and concise, but it doesn't create a sense of tension or foreboding. Additionally, the sentence "This is the write up of what happen" feels like a somewhat awkward transition, which disrupts the flow of the narrative and reduces the sense of suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph has some suspenseful elements, it could be more effective at building tension and creating a sense of urgency in the reader.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph is quite confusing and lacks clarity, which makes it difficult to understand what's happening. The use of words like "eggbeater" and "harmonium land" is unclear and doesn't create a sense of tension or suspense. The phrase "decisive simply unchanging consideration" is also unclear and doesn't convey a sense of urgency or danger.

The only potentially suspenseful element is the mention of Robert Knack being in a "decisive" condition, but it's not enough to create a sense of tension or anticipation. Overall, the paragraph's lack of clarity and confusing language makes it difficult to build suspense or create a sense of drama.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph is still quite confusing, with unclear language and unusual word choices ("world derive from the chopper", "belittled bluing electric refrigerator", "in the form of a display case"). However, the mention of a "full functioning liver" suggests that the story may be building towards a medical procedure or a critical moment, which creates some sense of anticipation.

The image of someone carrying a liver in a display case is also somewhat unusual and attention-grabbing, which adds to the sense of intrigue. However, the paragraph's overall clarity and coherence are still lacking, which prevents it from building more significant suspense or tension.

I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is very short and lacks any real detail or description. The sentence "The doctor make it quickly" is vague and doesn't provide much context or information. It's unclear what the doctor is doing or what the situation is, which makes it difficult to create suspense.

The only potential source of suspense is the implication that the doctor's arrival is urgent and timely, but this is not enough to create a strong sense of tension or anticipation. The paragraph feels more like a bland statement of fact than a suspenseful moment in a story.
