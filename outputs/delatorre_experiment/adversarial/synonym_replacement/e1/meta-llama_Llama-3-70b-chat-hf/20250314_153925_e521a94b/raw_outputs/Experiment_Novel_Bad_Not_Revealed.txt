I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a dramatic and intense situation, with a young boy's life hanging in the balance as he waits for a liver transplant. The use of specific details, such as the date and time, adds to the sense of urgency and realism. The phrase "his life cost vital" creates a sense of tension and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Henry survive?" and "What will happen next?"

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by the fact that it's presented as a "tale of a real consequence" and the reader is told upfront that they are about to read a news report of what happened. This framing device reduces the sense of uncertainty and unpredictability that is often essential to creating high suspense. Additionally, the paragraph's tone is more informative and matter-of-fact than suspenseful or thrilling, which also reduces the overall sense of tension.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is very effective in creating suspense because it:

* Uses a specific and dramatic event (the helicopter landing) to create a sense of urgency and tension
* Creates a sense of proximity to the action, with the use of a specific time (08:57) and a vivid description of the helicopter landing on the hospital roof
* Raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the organ arrive in time?" and "Will Henry Robert survive?"
* Uses words like "vital" and "static" to create a sense of gravity and uncertainty around Henry Robert's condition

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still somewhat straightforward and lacks a sense of surprise or unexpected twist. The reader is expecting the helicopter to arrive with the organ, and it does, so there's no major surprise or revelation. However, the paragraph still does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of urgency, making it very suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it:

* Creates a vivid and intense scene, with the helicopter's rotors still turning, the men's hair blown by the wind, and the sense of urgency and chaos
* Introduces a sense of drama and tension with the arrival of the liver, which is described as "blasphemous" and "fully functioning", creating a sense of high stakes
* Uses the character's actions and body language to create a sense of urgency and communication difficulties, such as the man shouting something inaudible and then using gestures to convey the message
* Creates a sense of countdown, with the man checking his watch and gesturing to the door, implying that time is running out
* Reiterates the gravity of the situation, with the reminder that the patient is in a "vital situation" and that there is no time to waste
* Uses descriptive language to create a sense of immersion, such as "top dog downward", "hair blown by the whirlwind", and "ducking down", which puts the reader in the midst of the action

The combination of these elements creates a paragraph that is extremely suspenseful, with a sense of urgency, drama, and high stakes. The reader is fully invested in the scene and is eager to find out what happens next.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is not suspenseful for several reasons:

* The scene is mundane and ordinary, with a cleaner going about their daily routine, which doesn't create a sense of tension or urgency.
* The description of the stairwell and the cleaner's job is detailed, but it's more focused on creating a sense of atmosphere and setting rather than building suspense.
* The tone of the paragraph is relaxed and matter-of-fact, with the cleaner whistling as he works, which doesn't create a sense of foreboding or danger.
* There is no sense of conflict, danger, or high stakes in this paragraph, which is essential for creating suspense.
* The paragraph is more focused on describing the cleaner's daily routine and the hospital's layout rather than creating a sense of tension or suspense.

Overall, this paragraph is more of a descriptive passage that sets the scene and establishes the cleaner's character, but it doesn't create any sense of suspense or tension.
