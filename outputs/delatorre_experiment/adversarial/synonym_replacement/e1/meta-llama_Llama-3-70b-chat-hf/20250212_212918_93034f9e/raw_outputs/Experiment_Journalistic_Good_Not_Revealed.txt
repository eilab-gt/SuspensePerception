I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a potentially dramatic and life-or-death situation, which is inherently suspenseful. The use of phrases like "imminent liver graft" and "his condition was critical" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert survive?" and "What will happen next?"

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by its dry, matter-of-fact tone and the lack of emotional connection with the protagonist, Robert. The writing is clear and concise, but it doesn't create a sense of tension or foreboding that would make the reader feel like they're on the edge of their seat.

Additionally, the final sentence "This is the write up of what happen" feels like a bit of an anti-climax, as it's a somewhat awkwardly phrased sentence that doesn't add much to the sense of suspense. Overall, while the paragraph has some suspenseful elements, it could be more effective at building tension and creating a sense of urgency.
