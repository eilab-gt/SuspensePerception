I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation with a real-life medical case, a critical patient, and a time-sensitive procedure.
* **Lack of immediate tension:** The language is a bit dry and factual, which reduces the immediate sense of urgency. 
* **Unclear stakes:** While we know Robert's condition is critical, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen in time.
* **Awkward phrasing:**  Some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("veridical case," "eighter from decatur year former son") detract from the overall impact.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Include his thoughts and feelings about the impending surgery.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Describe the potential consequences of failure more vividly.
* **Use more evocative language:** Replace dry, factual language with more descriptive and emotionally charged words.
* **Shorten sentences and create a faster pace:** This will increase the sense of urgency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing action:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ creates a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Short, impactful sentences:** The brevity of the sentences adds to the tension and creates a sense of immediacy.
* **Vague details:** The lack of detail about Robert's condition and the atmosphere in the hospital leaves room for the reader's imagination to fill in the blanks, increasing suspense.
* **Unclear outcome:** We don't know if the arrival of the organ will be in time or if the transplant will be successful.

**To increase suspense further:**

* **Sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the reactions of the medical team, and Robert's physical state.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **High stakes:** The urgency of the situation is clear – a life depends on the successful delivery of the liver.
* **Action-packed:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter and rushing towards the hospital creates a sense of movement and purpose.
* **Vague details:** The lack of clarity about what the man is shouting and the nature of the "vital post" adds to the mystery and suspense.
* **Awkward phrasing:** The use of archaic language ("be still turning," "hollo something unhearable") and grammatical errors detracts from the overall impact and can make it harder to fully immerse in the scene.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the patient is in a "vital post," describe the patient's condition and the medical team's frantic efforts to save him.
* **Build tension through dialogue:**  Include snippets of conversation between the men carrying the liver, revealing their concerns and anxieties.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine tasks creates a sense of ordinariness and predictability.
* **Lack of conflict or tension:** There are no immediate threats or challenges to create suspense.
* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("the service stairwell had no window," "the faculty used the lifts") distances the reader from the action and reduces the sense of immediacy.
* **Unrelated to the main plot:** The paragraph seems disconnected from the previous scenes about the liver transplant, making it feel irrelevant to the overall suspense.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Connect to the main plot:** Introduce an element that links the cleaner's actions to the fate of Robert or the liver transplant. Perhaps he overhears a conversation, notices something unusual, or accidentally disrupts a crucial event.
* **Introduce a threat:**  Create a sense of danger or uncertainty. Maybe the cleaner discovers something suspicious in the stairwell, or encounters a mysterious figure.
* **Use active voice and vivid language:**  Bring the scene to life with more descriptive language and active verbs.

This paragraph could be used to build suspense if it was rewritten to connect more directly to the main plot and introduce an element of danger or mystery.

* **Lingering questions:** Leave the reader with a thought-provoking question or a sense of wonder about the future.



While the paragraph provides a satisfying conclusion, it lacks the elements of suspense that would make it truly gripping.
