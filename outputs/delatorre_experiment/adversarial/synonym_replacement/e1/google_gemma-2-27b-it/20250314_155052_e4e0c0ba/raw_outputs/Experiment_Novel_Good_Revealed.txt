I would rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It reveals the outcome too early:** The paragraph states that the transplant was successful right at the end. This removes a lot of the tension that could be built around whether Henry would survive.
* **The language is factual and clinical:** While it mentions a life-or-death situation, the tone is detached and lacks emotional weight.  
* **There's no immediate threat or conflict:** We know a donor was found, so the main obstacle (finding a liver) is already overcome.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Delay revealing the outcome:**  Keep the reader guessing about Henry's fate until later in the story.
* **Focus on Henry's emotional state:** Describe his fear, hope, or pain to create empathy and raise the stakes.
* **Introduce a new conflict or complication:** Perhaps there's a delay in the organ arrival, or a complication during the surgery.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing imagery:** The image of a helicopter landing on a hospital roof with a vital organ is inherently dramatic and raises curiosity.
* **Sense of urgency:** The specific time ("08:57") and the use of words like "whirlybird" and "shore" create a sense of immediacy and action.
* **Limited information:** We don't know if the organ will arrive in time or if the transplant will be successful, leaving the reader with unanswered questions.

**To increase suspense further:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the tension in the room, or Henry's reaction to the arrival.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Maybe the organ is damaged, or there's a problem with the transplant team.
* **Focus on Henry's perspective:** Show his fear, hope, or desperation as he awaits the arrival of the organ.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Show the emotional toll:** Describe the men's anxiety, determination, or fear as they race against time.

Here's why:

* **Lack of immediacy:** The use of past tense and the straightforward language create a sense of distance and detachment.
* **Limited emotional impact:** While the outcome is positive, the paragraph lacks the emotional weight and impact that would make it truly suspenseful.

This paragraph effectively wraps up the story, but it doesn't leave the reader on the edge of their seat.
