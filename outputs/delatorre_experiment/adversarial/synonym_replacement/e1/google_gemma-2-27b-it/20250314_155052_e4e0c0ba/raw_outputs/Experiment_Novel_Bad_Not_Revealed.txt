I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph establishes a real-life, high-stakes situation with a ticking clock (Henry's deteriorating condition). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, there's no immediate, tangible threat presented. We know Henry is in danger, but we don't see it unfolding in the paragraph itself.
* **Promise of More:** The final sentence, "This is the report of what happened," creates anticipation and promises a more suspenseful narrative to come.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Henry's condition is vital, describe his symptoms or the doctors' worried expressions.
* **Introduce a complication:**  Add an unexpected obstacle or delay to the transplant process.
* **Heighten the emotional stakes:** Focus on Henry's fear or his family's desperation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Sense of Urgency:** The specific time ("08:57") and the use of "whirlybird" (helicopter) create a sense of urgency and action.
* **Vague Threat:** The phrase "vital only static shape" is intriguing and slightly unsettling. It implies Henry is barely clinging to life, raising the stakes.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know if the organ arrived in time or if there are any complications. This lack of information leaves the reader wanting more.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Sensory Details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the tension in the room, or the doctors' reactions.
* **Internal Monologue:** Include a brief thought from a character, revealing their anxiety or hope.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** End the paragraph on a note of uncertainty, leaving the reader wondering if the transplant will be successful.

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The urgency of the situation is palpable. The ticking clock (the patient's condition) and the helicopter's noise create a sense of pressure.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The paragraph focuses on a routine, everyday task (cleaning stairs) which doesn't inherently create suspense.
* **Lack of Threat:** There's no immediate danger or conflict presented. The cleaner's job is described as "agreeable" and uneventful.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the floor...had been mopped") and lack of strong verbs contribute to a sense of detachment and lack of urgency.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unsettling on the stairs, like a bloodstain or a hidden message.
* **Foreshadowing:** Hint at a potential danger lurking in the hospital, something the cleaner is unaware of.
* **Shift in Tone:**  Introduce a sense of unease or foreboding through the cleaner's thoughts or observations.



This paragraph sets a calm, ordinary scene, which could be used to create a contrast with a sudden, shocking event later on. However, on its own, it lacks suspense.
