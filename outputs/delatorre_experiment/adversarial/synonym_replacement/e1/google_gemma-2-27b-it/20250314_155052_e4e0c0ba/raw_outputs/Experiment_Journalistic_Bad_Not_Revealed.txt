I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Imagery:** The phrase "eggbeater carry the electric organ" is unusual and slightly unsettling, creating a sense of unease.
* **Ambiguity:** The meaning is not immediately clear. What is the "electric organ"? What does it mean to be "in a decisive merely unchanging shape"? This ambiguity piques the reader's curiosity.
* **Lack of Context:** The paragraph lacks the context established in the previous one, making it harder to fully grasp the situation and the potential danger.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Heighten the stakes:**  Suggest that something could go wrong with the delivery or the transplant.
* **Use stronger verbs:** Replace "carry" and "bring down" with more evocative verbs that convey a sense of urgency or tension.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The mention of two pieces falling from a chopper immediately raises the stakes. Something has gone wrong with the delivery.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Unclear Connection:** The paragraph feels disconnected from the previous ones. The focus shifts abruptly to a dry cleaner mopping a stairwell, with no clear link to the liver transplant situation.
* **Vague Threat:** The mention of a "cockeyed storey" foretoken is intriguing but lacks context. What does it mean? What threat does it pose?
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("have finish up mop") makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Establish a connection:**  Explain how the dry cleaner and the stairwell are related to the hospital or the transplant.
* **Develop the threat:**  Provide more information about the "cockeyed storey" foretoken and what it might signify.
* **Use active voice:**  Make the writing more direct and impactful by using active voice.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the dry cleaner left without displaying the foretoken, describe their actions and demeanor in a way that suggests something is amiss.

* **Heighten the stakes:** Suggest that someone might be pursuing them or that they are in a hurry.
* **Reveal character:** Give the reader some insight into the thoughts and motivations of the two individuals.
* **Connect to the previous events:**  Establish a clearer link between this action and the earlier events involving the chopper and the liver.
