I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation with a real-life medical case, a critical patient, and a time-sensitive procedure.
* **Lack of immediate tension:** The language is a bit dry and factual, which reduces the immediate sense of urgency. 
* **Unclear stakes:** While we know Robert's condition is critical, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen in time.
* **Awkward phrasing:**  Some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("veridical case," "eighter from decatur year former son") detract from the overall impact.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Include his thoughts and feelings about the impending surgery.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Describe the potential consequences of failure more vividly.
* **Use more evocative language:** Replace dry, factual language with more descriptive and sensory details.
* **Shorten sentences and create a faster pace:** This will increase the sense of urgency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing action:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ creates a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Short, impactful sentences:** The brevity of the sentences adds to the tension and creates a sense of immediacy.

**To increase suspense further:**

* **Sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the whirring of the blades, the tension in the air.
* **Robert's reaction:** Show how Robert reacts to the arrival of the organ, even if it's just a subtle change in his expression.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **High stakes:** The urgency of the situation is clear â€“ the patient is in critical condition and time is of the essence.
* **Action-packed:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter and rushing towards the hospital creates a sense of movement and purpose.
* **Vague details:** The lack of clarity about what the man is shouting and the nature of the "vital post" adds to the mystery and suspense.

**However:**

* **Awkward phrasing:** The language is clunky and grammatically incorrect ("oral sex down," "helium hadn't managed to reach himself heard"). This detracts from the overall impact.
* **Lack of emotional connection:** We don't get a sense of the characters' emotions or the weight of the situation.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Refine the language:** Use clearer, more concise language to create a more immersive experience.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the patient is in a vital post, describe the patient's condition and the urgency of the situation through sensory details and action.
* **Focus on the characters:** Give the reader a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of the men carrying the liver. Are they anxious? Determined? Hopeful?

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of the uninteresting stairwell create a sense of ordinariness, which works against suspense.
* **Lack of conflict or tension:** There's no immediate threat or danger, and the cleaner seems content with his work.
* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("the service stairwell had no window," "the faculty used the lifts") distances the reader from the action and reduces the sense of immediacy.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a threat:**  Hint at something unusual or unsettling happening in the stairwell, even if it's subtle.
* **Focus on the cleaner's perspective:** Show his thoughts and feelings as he works, perhaps hinting at a growing sense of unease.
* **Use active voice and sensory details:**  Bring the scene to life with vivid descriptions and create a more immersive experience for the reader.

* **Visual imagery:** The description of the transparent liquid, the Petri dish, and the microscope adds to the realism and engagement.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a clear resolution to the suspense built up throughout the story. The liver is functioning correctly, and the patient is safe.
* **Lack of tension:**  Since the outcome is positive, there's no lingering sense of danger or uncertainty.
* **Straightforward language:** The language is simple and direct, lacking the vivid imagery or emotional depth that could enhance suspense.

**To increase suspense even at this point:**

* **Delayed gratification:** You could briefly hint at a potential complication before revealing the positive outcome.
* **Emotional impact:** Focus on the relief and joy of the medical team and the patient's family.
* **Lingering questions:**  Perhaps introduce a new element of uncertainty, such as the long-term prognosis for the patient.



While this paragraph effectively concludes the story on a positive note, it lacks the suspenseful elements that characterized the earlier parts.
