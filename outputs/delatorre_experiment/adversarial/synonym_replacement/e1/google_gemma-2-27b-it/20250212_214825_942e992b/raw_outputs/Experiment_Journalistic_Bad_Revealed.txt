I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph starts with a strong hook, claiming to be based on a true event and setting a specific time and location. This immediately piques the reader's curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The situation with Robert Bent needing a liver transplant creates tension. The reader understands the urgency and the potential for tragedy.
* **Unclear Outcome:** The paragraph hints at a negative outcome ("they follow not sure if Henry martyn robert would survive") but doesn't explicitly state what happens. This leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Pacing:** The paragraph feels a bit rushed. Slowing down the pacing and building up the tension more gradually would make it more suspenseful.
* **Spoiler Alert:** The last sentence reveals the tragic outcome, removing much of the suspense. It would be more effective to keep the reader guessing until later in the story. 


By addressing the grammatical issues, refining the pacing, and withholding the ending, the author could significantly increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph.

Here's why:

* **Shocking Action:** The phrase "His fellow directly kick the bucket" is jarring and unexpected. It immediately grabs the reader's attention and creates a sense of shock and unease.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("kick the bucket," "atomic number 2," "non deal in any room") make the writing difficult to understand and detract from the impact.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is confusing and lacks clear descriptions. It's unclear who the characters are, what they're doing, or what the "caseful" refers to.

* **No Tension or Threat:** There's no indication of danger, conflict, or any other element that would create suspense. The sentence is simply a statement of fact.
* **No Emotional Impact:** The sentence is flat and unemotional. It doesn't evoke any feelings of anticipation, fear, or curiosity in the reader.



To make this paragraph suspenseful, the author would need to add significant context, build tension, and create a sense of anticipation about what might happen next.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

* **Intriguing Setup:** The image of opening a pillowcase to find something unexpected inside is inherently intriguing. It piques the reader's curiosity and makes them want to know what's inside.
* **Sense of Dread:** The phrase "inner bagful possess rupture" suggests something has gone wrong. The word "rupture" implies a sudden and potentially dangerous event.
* **Open Ending:** The paragraph ends without revealing the contents of the ruptured bag, leaving the reader in suspense and wondering what the consequences might be.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The phrasing "possess rupture" is awkward and grammatically incorrect. It could be improved by saying "had ruptured" or "was ruptured."
* **Lack of Context:** The paragraph provides no context about who "they" are, where they are, or why they are opening a pillowcase. This lack of information makes it harder for the reader to connect with the scene and feel invested in the suspense.

By addressing the grammatical issues, providing more context, and building on the sense of dread, the author could make this paragraph even more suspenseful.
