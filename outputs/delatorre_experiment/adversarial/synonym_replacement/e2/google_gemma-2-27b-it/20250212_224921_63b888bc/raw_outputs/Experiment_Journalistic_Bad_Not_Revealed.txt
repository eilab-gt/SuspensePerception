I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph establishes a high-stakes situation with a child needing a liver transplant and the uncertainty of his survival. This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the impending surgery and the fact that the donor organ is expected "today" creates a sense of urgency.
* **Uncertain Outcome:** The phrase "they were not sure if Henry Robert would last the waiting" leaves the reader wondering if the transplant will happen in time.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Vivid Detail:** The paragraph lacks sensory details and emotional depth that could further enhance the suspense.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Polish the grammar and syntax.**
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, the boy's condition, the emotions of the medical team.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Introduce a subtle element of doubt or danger to heighten the tension.
