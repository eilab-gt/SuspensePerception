I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph establishes a real-life, high-stakes situation with a ticking clock (Henry's deteriorating condition). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is quite general. We don't know much about Henry Robert, the nature of his illness, or the specific challenges of the transplant. This lack of detail prevents the suspense from reaching its full potential.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph relies heavily on telling the reader about the situation rather than showing it through vivid descriptions or dialogue. This creates distance and reduces the emotional impact.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds, the smells, the emotions on the faces of the medical team.
* **Focus on Henry Robert's perspective:** What is he feeling? What are his hopes and fears?
* **Introduce a potential obstacle:** Hint at a complication that could jeopardize the transplant.

* **Stark Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the life-saving organ with Henry Robert's "vital only static shape" creates a powerful contrast and raises the stakes.

* **Show, don't tell:** Describe the helicopter landing, the medical team's reactions, the atmosphere in the room.
* **Build anticipation:**  Focus on the moments leading up to the transplant, highlighting the delicate nature of the procedure.
* **Introduce a potential complication:** Hint at a problem that could arise during the transplant.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The paragraph focuses on a routine cleaning job, which lacks inherent suspense.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There are no immediate threats or obstacles. The cleaner's work is described as easy and uneventful.

* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Maybe the cleaner is running late or has a deadline to meet.
* **Focus on the Cleaner's Perspective:** Explore the cleaner's thoughts and feelings. Is he bored? Does he sense something is wrong?

####################################################################################################
I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Anti-climactic Ending:** After building suspense throughout the story, the final paragraph feels somewhat flat and anticlimactic. The news of Henry Robert's death is delivered matter-of-factly, without much emotional impact.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph lacks the vivid descriptions and emotional depth that characterized the previous sections. We don't get a sense of the grief or despair of the medical team or Henry Robert's family.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the death of Henry Robert Bent was certified") further distances the reader from the emotional weight of the situation.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating Henry Robert's death, describe the scene in the hospital room. Show the reactions of the doctors and nurses.
* **Focus on a Specific Character:** Explore the thoughts and feelings of one of the characters who was invested in Henry Robert's survival.
* **Add a Final Twist:** Consider adding a final, unexpected detail that leaves the reader with a lingering sense of unease or sadness.



While the paragraph effectively conveys the tragic outcome, it lacks the emotional punch and suspenseful delivery that the rest of the story built up.
