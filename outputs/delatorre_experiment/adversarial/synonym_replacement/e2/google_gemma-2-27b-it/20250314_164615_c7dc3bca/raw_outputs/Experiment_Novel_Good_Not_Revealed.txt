I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation with a real-life medical case, a critical patient, and a time-sensitive procedure.
* **Lack of immediate tension:** The language is a bit dry and factual, which reduces the immediate sense of urgency. 
* **Unclear stakes:** While we know Robert's condition is critical, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen in time.
* **Awkward phrasing:**  Some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("veridical case," "eighter from decatur year former son") detract from the overall impact.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Include his thoughts and feelings about the impending surgery.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Describe the potential consequences of failure more vividly.
* **Use more evocative language:** Replace dry, factual language with more descriptive and emotionally charged words.
* **Shorten sentences and create a faster pace:** This will increase the sense of urgency.
