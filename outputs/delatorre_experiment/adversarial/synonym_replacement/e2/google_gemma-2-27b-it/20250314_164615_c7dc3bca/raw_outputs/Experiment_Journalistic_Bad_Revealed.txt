I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph starts with a strong hook, claiming to be based on a true event and setting a specific time and place. This immediately piques the reader's curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The situation with Robert Bent needing a liver transplant creates tension. The reader understands the urgency and the potential for tragedy.
* **Unclear Outcome:** The paragraph hints at a negative outcome ("they follow not sure if Henry martyn robert would survive") but doesn't explicitly state what happens. This leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Pacing:** The paragraph feels a bit rushed. Slowing down the pacing and building up the tension more gradually would make it more suspenseful.
* **Spoiler Alert:** The last sentence reveals the tragic outcome, removing much of the suspense. It would be more effective to keep the reader guessing until later in the story. 


By addressing the grammatical issues, refining the pacing, and withholding the ending, the author could significantly increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Detail:** The mention of a helicopter carrying an organ creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Medical Jargon:** The use of terms like "organ" and "critical" adds a layer of seriousness and tension.
* **Vague Description:** The phrase "critical but stable condition" leaves the reader wondering about Robert's exact state and whether he will survive.

* **Lack of Context:** The paragraph lacks context about what happened before and what might happen next. This makes it difficult for the reader to fully engage with the suspense.
* **Short Length:** The brevity of the paragraph limits its ability to build tension effectively.


By addressing the grammatical issues, providing more context, and expanding on the scene, the author could significantly increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Imagery:** The image of two attendants descending from a helicopter, one carrying a briefcase-sized cooler containing a liver, is striking and unusual. It immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The action of descending from a helicopter implies speed and importance, adding to the suspense.
* **Mystery:** The paragraph doesn't explicitly state what's happening or why the liver is being transported in this way. This leaves the reader with questions and a desire to know more.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The awkward phrasing and grammatical errors ("valet de chambre," "single of whom be bear") detract from the overall impact.

* **Rewrite the sentence for clarity and grammatical correctness.**
* **Provide context about the situation and the characters involved.**
* **Introduce a sense of threat or danger.**
* **Use sensory details to create a more immersive experience for the reader.**
