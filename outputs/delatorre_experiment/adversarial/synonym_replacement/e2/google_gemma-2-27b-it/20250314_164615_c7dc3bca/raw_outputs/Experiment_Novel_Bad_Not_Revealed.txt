I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph establishes a real-life, high-stakes situation with a ticking clock (Henry's deteriorating condition). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, there's no immediate, tangible threat presented. We know Henry is in danger, but we don't see it unfolding in the paragraph itself.
* **Promise of More:** The final sentence, "This is the report of what happened," creates anticipation and promises a more suspenseful narrative to come.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Henry's condition is vital, describe his symptoms or the doctors' worried expressions.
* **Introduce a complication:**  Add an unexpected obstacle or delay to the transplant process.
* **Heighten the emotional stakes:** Focus on Henry's fear or his family's desperation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Sense of Urgency:** The specific time ("08:57") and the use of "whirlybird" (helicopter) create a sense of urgency and action.
* **Vague Threat:** The phrase "vital only static shape" is intriguing and slightly unsettling. It implies Henry is barely clinging to life, raising the stakes.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know if the organ arrived in time or if there are any complications. This lack of information leaves the reader wanting more.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Sensory Details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the tension in the room, or the doctors' reactions.
* **Internal Monologue:** Include a brief thought from a character, revealing their anxiety or hope.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** End the paragraph with a question or a hint of impending danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The urgency of the situation is palpable. The ticking clock (the patient's condition) and the helicopter's noise create a sense of pressure.
* **Visual Details:** The description of the men battling the wind, the "blasphemous case," and the frantic gestures heighten the tension.
* **Unclear Communication:** The inaudible shout and the reliance on gestures create a sense of uncertainty and potential for miscommunication.
* **Sense of Danger:** The phrase "no time to drop off" implies a high risk of failure.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Internal Monologue:** Include the thoughts of one of the men, revealing their fears or doubts.
* **Close Call:** Introduce a near-miss or a moment where the organ is almost lost.
* **Foreshadowing:** Hint at a potential complication or obstacle that could jeopardize the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The paragraph focuses on a routine, everyday task (cleaning stairs) which lacks inherent suspense.
* **Lack of Threat:** There's no sense of danger or impending doom. The cleaner's job is described as "agreeable" and there are no hints of anything unusual happening.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the floor...had been finished mopping") creates a detached and uneventful tone.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a Mystery:**  Hint at something strange or out of place in the stairwell.
* **Foreshadow Danger:**  Include subtle clues that something bad is about to happen.
* **Shift Perspective:**  Focus on the perspective of someone who is unaware of the danger lurking in the stairwell.



This paragraph sets a calm, ordinary scene which contrasts sharply with the high-stakes situation described in the previous paragraphs. This contrast could be used to build suspense later on, but on its own, it's not very suspenseful.

* **Delayed Gratification:** The paragraph builds anticipation by leading up to the announcement of Henry's death.
* **Sense of Finality:** The confirmation of Henry's death is a definitive and somber conclusion.
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** The paragraph is quite factual and lacks emotional depth, which diminishes the suspense.
