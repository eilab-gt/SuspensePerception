"On February 24, 2008, at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco, California, an eight-year-old boy named Henry Martyn Robert was about to undergo a life-saving liver transplant. The medical team had been preparing for this moment since 8 a.m., but they were not sure if Henry would survive the wait. Just the day before, a suitable donor had been found, and now they were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the organ. This is the story of what happened that day, and whether Henry would make it through the critical hours ahead." This revised paragraph uses more active language and provides more context about the situation, which can help to build tension and engage the reader.
