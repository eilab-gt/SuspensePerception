The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a child awaiting a liver transplant and the uncertainty of whether he will survive until the organ arrives. The use of specific details, such as the date and location, adds to the realism and tension of the situation. However, the paragraph does not build up the suspense in a particularly dramatic way, and the outcome is not yet revealed, leaving the reader in a state of anticipation rather than intense suspense. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph increases the suspense by introducing a time element and the critical condition of the patient, Henry Martyn Robert, while the helicopter carrying the organ has just landed. The use of specific time ("08:57") adds a sense of urgency, and the description of Henry's condition as "vital but static" implies that his situation is precarious and could change at any moment. The fact that the organ has arrived but has not yet been transplanted also adds to the tension. I would rate this paragraph a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense by providing a vivid, detailed scene of the organ's arrival and the urgency of the situation. The description of the men disembarking from the helicopter, the critical condition of the organ, and the communication difficulties due to the noise of the blades all contribute to a sense of immediacy and tension. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the lack of time adds to the stakes. The use of body language to communicate urgency and the focus on the ticking clock (the watch on the wrist) further heightens the suspense. I would rate this paragraph an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph has a low level of suspense as it describes a routine and mundane task of a cleaner mopping the floors in a hospital stairwell. The details provided are more about the setting and the cleaner's daily routine rather than building tension or anticipation. The lack of any impending conflict or uncertainty makes the scene feel more like a backdrop for the story rather than a source of suspense. I would rate this paragraph a 2 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph introduces a sense of urgency and decision-making, which can create a moderate level of suspense. The characters' actions and dialogue suggest that time is of the essence, and the decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a sense of immediacy and physical effort to the situation. The mention of the patient being on the sixth floor and the need to move quickly to get there also adds to the tension. However, the paragraph does not contain any dramatic twists or high stakes that would significantly increase the suspense. I would rate this paragraph a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph significantly increases the suspense by introducing a sudden and unexpected event: the man slipping and dropping the organ case. The description of the case rolling down the stairs while the man struggles to regain his balance creates a sense of chaos and danger. The use of vivid imagery, such as the sound of the case hitting each step, adds to the tension and the horror of the situation. The stakes are high, as the fate of the patient's transplant is now uncertain. I would rate this paragraph an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by continuing the crisis initiated in the previous paragraph. The uncertainty about the condition of the organ and the potential consequences of its fall create a sense of urgency. The decision-making process between the two men, with one staying to guard the case and the other rushing to alert the medical team, adds to the tension. The stakes are still high, as the success of the transplant could be jeopardized. The quick actions and the need to navigate the hospital's corridors to reach the transplant department also contribute to the sense of immediacy. I would rate this paragraph an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by focusing on the emotional and physical state of the man guarding the organ case. The description of his pain and his superstitious belief that his suffering is somehow linked to the condition of the organ adds a psychological element to the tension. The uncertainty about the organ's condition and the arrival of the medical team, who immediately take charge of the situation, also contribute to the suspense. The stakes are still high, as the outcome of the transplant hangs in the balance. I would rate this paragraph an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense by revealing the damage to the organ's protective case. The description of the outer case opening and the damage to the small portable refrigerator creates a sense of dread and uncertainty about the condition of the organ inside. The doctor's reaction, shaking his head, implies that the situation is dire, and the mention of the refrigerated air slowly escaping adds to the tension, as it suggests that the organ may no longer be properly preserved. I would rate this paragraph a 9 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

The tension builds as the surgeon performs the critical biopsy, with the description of holding his breath and the careful extraction of the sample adding to the sense of high stakes. The suspense is further heightened by the detailed observation of the surgeon's actions and reactions as he examines the sample under the microscope. The use of pauses, such as pursing his lips and lifting his head to blink, creates a sense of deliberation and uncertainty. The final revelation that the organ has definitively deteriorated due to the impact resolves the suspense with a dramatic and tragic outcome.

This paragraph is very suspenseful, rating a 9 on the 9-point scale. The finality of the announcement of Henry Martyn Robert Knack's death, coupled with the specific time given, creates a stark and dramatic conclusion to the tension that has been building throughout the previous paragraphs. The mention of the medical team's inability to perform the liver transplant due to the damage sustained during transportation resolves the central conflict with a tragic outcome, which is the ultimate high-stakes resolution in a suspenseful narrative.
