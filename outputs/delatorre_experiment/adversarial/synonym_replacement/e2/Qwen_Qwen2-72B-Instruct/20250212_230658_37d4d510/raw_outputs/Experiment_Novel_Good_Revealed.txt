The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, primarily due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the liver transplant for the eight-year-old boy, Robert Hang. The details about the event being real and the critical nature of the patient's condition add to the tension. The fact that they were unsure if he would survive the wait for the organ also heightens the suspense. The resolution of the story, where the medical team verifies that the transplanted liver is functioning correctly, provides a relief from the suspense but is not included in the suspense rating. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for its level of suspense.
