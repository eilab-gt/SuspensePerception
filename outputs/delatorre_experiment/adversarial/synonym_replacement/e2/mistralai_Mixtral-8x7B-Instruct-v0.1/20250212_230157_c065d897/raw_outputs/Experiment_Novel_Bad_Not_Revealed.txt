 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some additional information about the situation, such as the arrival of the helicopter carrying the liver, it does not do much to build on the tension and suspense established in the previous paragraph. The use of the word "duly" suggests that the arrival of the liver was expected and routine, which may reduce the sense of urgency and uncertainty. Additionally, the paragraph does not provide any new information about Henry's condition or the progress of the transplant, which could have helped to maintain the suspense. Overall, the paragraph is somewhat suspenseful, but it could benefit from further development to keep the reader engaged and invested in the story.

  I would rate the paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph provides more details about the arrival of the liver and the actions of the men carrying it, which helps to build on the tension and suspense established in the previous paragraphs. The use of descriptive language, such as "hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning vane," adds to the sense of urgency and drama. The paragraph also introduces a new element of suspense by mentioning that the patient is in a vital situation and that there is no time to drop off the liver at another location. This creates a sense of uncertainty about whether the transplant will be successful and whether Henry will survive. Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful and helps to keep the reader engaged in the story. 

However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the progress of the transplant. For example, the paragraph could mention that the medical team is running out of time to perform the transplant or that there are complications that could jeopardize the procedure. These types of details could help to heighten the suspense and make the reader more invested in the outcome of the story.

  I would rate the paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph does not contain any elements of suspense or tension, and it does not relate to the story of Henry Martin Bent's liver transplant. Instead, it focuses on the mundane tasks of a hospital cleaner and provides a detailed description of his daily routine. While the paragraph may provide some context for the setting of the story, it does not contribute to the suspense or engage the reader in any way. Overall, the paragraph is not suspenseful and does not add to the overall suspensefulness of the story. 

To make the paragraph more suspenseful, the author could connect it more directly to the story of the liver transplant. For example, the paragraph could mention that the cleaner's routine is interrupted by the arrival of the helicopter carrying the liver, or that he encounters the medical team rushing to perform the transplant as he is cleaning the stairwell. These types of details could help to create a sense of tension and uncertainty and make the reader more invested in the story. 

Additionally, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it included more descriptive language and used more vivid imagery to bring the setting to life. For example, the paragraph could describe the sounds and smells of the hospital, or the appearance of the medical staff as they rush to perform the transplant. These types of details could help to create a sense of atmosphere and make the reader feel more immersed in the story. 

Overall, the paragraph is not suspenseful, but it could be made more suspenseful with some minor revisions.
