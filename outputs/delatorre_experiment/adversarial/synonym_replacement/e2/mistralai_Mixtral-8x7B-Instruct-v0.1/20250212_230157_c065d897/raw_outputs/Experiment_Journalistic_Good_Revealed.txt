 I would rate the suspensefulness of the paragraph as an 8 out of 9. The paragraph does a good job of building tension and anticipation around the transplant surgery and the question of whether Robert will survive the wait for the new liver. The use of time-specific details, such as the exact date and time of the event, adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. Additionally, the paragraph provides just enough information to pique the reader's interest while still leaving some mystery around the outcome of the surgery. Overall, the paragraph effectively conveys a sense of suspense and keeps the reader engaged.

 I would rate the suspensefulness of the paragraph as a 5 out of 9. The paragraph provides some tension with the time-specific detail of the helicopter landing at 8:47 a.m. and the mention of Henry's critical but stable condition. However, the paragraph is relatively brief and does not provide much context or background information about the situation, which makes it less suspenseful than the previous paragraph. Additionally, the use of technical medical terms such as "whirlybird" and "pipe organ" (which I assume are meant to be "helicopter" and "liver," respectively) can be confusing and distracting for the reader. Overall, the paragraph has some elements of suspense, but it could benefit from more context and clearer language to fully engage the reader.
