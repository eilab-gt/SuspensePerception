I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is necessary but not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of Henry Martyn Robert Bent and the medical team creates a sense of tension, as the reader is aware that something critical is happening.
* The mention of the liver transplantation and the urgency of the situation raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.
* However, the paragraph does not have a strong hook or a sense of surprise, which would make it more suspenseful. The events are presented in a fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact way, without much build-up or tension.
* The paragraph ends with a somewhat abrupt transition to "This be the story of what happened", which feels a bit like a non-sequitur and doesn't really add to the suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some tension and raises questions in the reader's mind, it doesn't have a strong sense of suspense or surprise, which is what would make it more engaging and suspenseful.
