I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is immediately aware that something serious is happening and that the outcome is uncertain.
* The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The introduction of the medical team and the fact that they are waiting for a liver transplant creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind (e.g. will they be able to perform the transplant in time?).
* The twist at the end, where the harmonium is damaged and the patient dies, is a surprise and adds to the suspense. It's a dramatic and unexpected turn of events that makes the reader wonder what could have been done differently.

However, there are a few things that prevent the paragraph from being more suspenseful:

* The writing is quite straightforward and lacks a sense of tension or foreboding. The language is simple and lacks vivid descriptions or sensory details that could help to create a more immersive experience.
* The paragraph is quite short and lacks build-up or escalation. The story feels like it's over almost as soon as it begins, which makes it hard to become fully invested in the characters or the outcome.
* The use of the phrase "This follow the storey of what find" at the end feels awkward and unclear. It's not entirely clear what this sentence is supposed to mean or how it relates to the rest of the paragraph.
