I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a serious and somber tone, mentioning a real event at a children's hospital, which grabs the reader's attention.

* The use of phrases like "decisive" and "not sure" adds to the sense of uncertainty and raises the stakes.
* The sudden and unexpected twist at the end, where Robert dies due to the damage to the organ, is a surprise and adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and suspense more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome at the beginning.
* Provided more details about Robert's condition and the medical team's efforts to save him, to make the reader more invested in the outcome.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of the scene and create a sense of atmosphere.
