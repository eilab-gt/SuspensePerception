I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is immediately aware that something serious is happening and that the outcome is uncertain.
* The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The description of Henry's condition and the urgency of the situation creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Henry survive?" and "Will the transplant be successful?"
* The use of phrases like "all quiet for his impendent liver transplant" and "not trusted if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of foreboding and raises the stakes.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created more tension and uncertainty by delaying the resolution of the story. For example, it could have ended with Henry's condition still uncertain, rather than revealing that the transplant was successful.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader's mind. For example, it could have described the emotions and reactions of the medical team and Henry's family as they waited for the transplant.
* Added more twists or surprises to the story. For example, it could have revealed that there were complications during the transplant or that Henry's condition was more serious than initially thought.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively sets the scene for a suspenseful story, but it could be even more effective with a few tweaks.
