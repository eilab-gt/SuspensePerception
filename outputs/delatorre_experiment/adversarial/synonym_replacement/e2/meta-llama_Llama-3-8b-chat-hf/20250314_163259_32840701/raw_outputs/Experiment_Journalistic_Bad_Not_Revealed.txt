I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is necessary but not particularly suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The use of the phrase "decisive merely unchanging shape" creates a sense of tension and foreboding, implying that Henry's condition is critical and may not improve.
* The fact that the "electric organ" (presumably the liver transplant) is being brought down to the infirmary creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen next.
