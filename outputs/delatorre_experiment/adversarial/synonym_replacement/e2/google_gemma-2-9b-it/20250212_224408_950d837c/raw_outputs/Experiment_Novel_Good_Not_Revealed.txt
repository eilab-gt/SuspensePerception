I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a "veridical case" and a medical emergency immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly life-or-death, with Robert needing a liver transplant urgently.
* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph emphasizes the uncertainty of Robert's survival ("they be not certain if Henry martyn robert would exist the wait").

**However, it lacks some key elements that would elevate the suspense:**

* **Lack of Tension Building:** The paragraph states the facts without creating a sense of urgency or dread. 
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was found," "be not certain") makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't get a sense of Robert's feelings or the emotional weight of the situation for the medical team.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* Use more active voice and vivid language to describe the scene.
* Focus on the ticking clock and the mounting pressure.
* Hint at potential complications or obstacles.
* Give us a glimpse into Robert's thoughts or feelings.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The mention of a helicopter and a "decisive just unchanging status" hints at something significant happening.
* **Unusual Language:** The use of words like "whirlybird" and "harmonium" adds a touch of mystery.

**However, it falls short in several areas:**

* **Lack of Clarity:** The sentence structure is awkward and confusing. It's unclear what "harmonium shoot down duly" means.
* **Missing Context:** We don't know who Henry m. robert Set is or why his status is so important.
* **No Emotional Hook:** The paragraph is purely descriptive and lacks any emotional impact.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Clarify the situation:** Explain what's happening with the helicopter and the "harmonium."
* **Provide context:** Give us more information about Robert's condition and the stakes involved.
* **Use stronger verbs and imagery:**  Instead of "shoot down duly," describe the helicopter's arrival in a more dramatic way.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the helicopter and the mention of a compatible liver clearly raise the stakes. We know time is of the essence.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the wind, the whirring blades, and the men's appearance creates a vivid and slightly chaotic atmosphere.
* **Urgency:** The phrase "they had no time to lose" emphasizes the pressure on the situation.

**However, it could be improved:**

* **Clarity:** Some sentences are awkwardly phrased and could be clearer. For example, "oral sex down" is unclear and likely a typo.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating that the patient is in a "vital post," describe their condition in a way that conveys the urgency.
* **Internal Conflict:**  Adding a hint of internal conflict or doubt from one of the men could increase the suspense.


**Here are some suggestions for improvement:**

* Replace "oral sex down" with a more appropriate phrase, like "heads bowed" or "faces grim."
* Instead of saying "the patient was in a vital post," describe their labored breathing, the beeping of machines, or the worried faces of the medical staff.
* Consider adding a line about one of the men feeling the weight of responsibility or questioning if they'll make it in time.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the mundane details of a cleaning routine. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or conflict.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("the cleaner had finished mowing," "the service stairwell had no window") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.
