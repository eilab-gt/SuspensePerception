I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line immediately grabs attention by promising a "real consequence" and setting the scene in a hospital. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly urgent – a child needs a life-saving liver transplant, and time is running out.
* **Lack of Detail:**  The paragraph is very general. We don't know what makes Henry's situation so precarious, or what specific challenges the medical team faces. This lack of detail prevents the suspense from building to a higher level.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Henry's situation is vital, but it doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the sterile environment of the hospital, the anxious atmosphere, the beeping of machines.
* **Reveal Henry's internal thoughts and feelings:**  What is he thinking and feeling as he waits for the transplant?
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Is there a risk the donor organ won't be compatible? Are there unforeseen medical issues?
* **Create a sense of urgency:** Use strong verbs and short sentences to convey the ticking clock.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the organ is a crucial turning point, raising the stakes significantly. The phrase "vital only static shape"  immediately conveys the seriousness of Henry's condition.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The specific time ("08:57") and the helicopter's arrival create a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Vague Details:**  We don't know the exact nature of Henry's condition or the challenges the medical team faces in getting the organ to him. This lack of detail prevents the suspense from reaching its full potential.
* **Awkward Phrasing:**  The sentence structure is a bit clunky ("whirlybird carry the hammond organ set down duly").  Smoother phrasing would enhance the impact.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Henry is in a "vital only static shape," describe his physical state, his labored breathing, the beeping of machines.
* **Focus on the Medical Team:**  Describe the doctors and nurses rushing to prepare for the transplant, their expressions of hope and anxiety.
* **Build Tension:**  Use shorter sentences, more active verbs, and sensory details to create a sense of mounting tension.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There are no immediate threats, mysteries, or obstacles.
* **Passive Voice:** The frequent use of passive voice ("the floor was mopped," "the corridor was cleaned") makes the action feel distant and uneventful.
* **Descriptive, Not Suspenseful:** While the paragraph provides details about the cleaner's job, these details don't create a sense of anticipation or dread.
* **Predictable Plot:** The entire paragraph follows a predictable pattern – the cleaner mops, he takes the lift down, and he continues his workday.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce an Unexpected Event:**  Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual while mopping, or hears a strange noise.
* **Create a Sense of Unease:**  Describe the hospital in a more unsettling way – dimly lit, echoing, with a sense of isolation.
* **Hint at a Hidden Threat:**  Introduce a character or element that suggests danger, even if it's not immediately apparent.
* **Focus on the Cleaner's Internal Thoughts:**  What are his fears, anxieties, or suspicions?



Remember, suspense is about keeping the reader guessing and on edge. This paragraph needs a significant shift in tone and plot to achieve that effect.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setting:** The description of the helipad exit, service stairwell, and secondary corridor creates a sense of mystery and intrigue. These are not typical places we associate with high-stakes situations, which adds to the suspense.
* **Time Pressure:** The emphasis on speed ("it'll take longer than walking down two floors") creates a sense of urgency.
* **Dialogue:** The brief exchange between the two men adds a layer of tension and reveals their awareness of the situation's importance.

**However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful by:**

* **Heightening the Stakes:** What are the specific consequences if the patient doesn't receive the transplant in time?
* **Adding Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds, smells, and atmosphere of the hospital corridors to create a more immersive experience.
* **Building Foreshadowing:**  Are there any subtle hints or clues that suggest potential danger or complications?
* **Focusing on Internal Thoughts:** What are the men thinking and feeling as they race against time?

* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph simply states the facts without immersing the reader in the emotional weight of the situation.
