I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a needed organ transplant immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of "decisive" condition and the wait for the organ creates a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very general. We don't know enough about Henry's condition, the risks involved, or the emotional state of those involved to feel truly invested in the outcome.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the suspense ("they were not trusted if Robert would survive the wait") instead of showing it through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.
* **Awkward Language:** The numerous grammatical errors and unusual word choices ("astir," "office," "aesculapian") distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.


To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Henry's pain, the anxious faces of the medical staff.
* **Develop characters:** Give us glimpses into Henry's personality, his fears, and his hopes.
* **Build tension through dialogue:**  Use conversations to reveal the stakes and the uncertainty of the situation.
* **Use foreshadowing:**  Hint at potential complications or setbacks.
* **Refine the language:**  Ensure clear and concise writing that flows smoothly.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of the organ by helicopter immediately raises the stakes and suggests urgency.
* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know enough about Henry's condition to truly feel the gravity of the situation.  "Vital simply unchanging precondition" is vague and doesn't evoke much emotion.
* **Awkward Language:**  The phrasing is clunky and the use of "pipe organ" instead of "liver" is confusing.  

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Henry's condition, describe his physical state, his breathing, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the smell of antiseptic in the air, the frantic activity in the hospital.
* **Create a Sense of Time Pressure:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation. Is the organ delicate? Is there a limited time window for the transplant?
* **Refine the Language:**  Use precise and evocative language to create a more immersive experience.

Here's why:

* **Confusing Language:** The sentence structure is awkward and the word choices are bizarre ("Ii man," "unrivaled," "pocket size blue devil electric refrigerator," "soma of a font"). This makes it difficult to understand what's happening and detracts from any potential suspense.

To improve the suspense, the author needs to:

* **Clarify the Language:** Use clear, concise language that is easy to understand.
* **Provide Context:** Give the reader more information about Henry's situation and the importance of the liver transplant.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating facts, use descriptive language to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind.
* **Build Tension:**  Use pacing, foreshadowing, and sensory details to create a sense of anticipation and dread.
