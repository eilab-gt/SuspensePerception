I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line immediately grabs attention by promising a "real consequence" and setting the scene in a hospital. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly urgent – a child needs a life-saving liver transplant, and time is running out.
* **Lack of Detail:**  The paragraph is very general. We don't know what makes Henry's situation so precarious, or what specific challenges the medical team faces. This lack of detail prevents the suspense from building to a higher level.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Henry's situation is vital, but it doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the sterile environment of the hospital, the anxious atmosphere, the beeping of machines.
* **Reveal Henry's internal thoughts and feelings:**  What is he thinking and feeling as he waits for the transplant?
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Is there a risk the donor organ won't be compatible? Are there unforeseen medical issues?
* **Create a sense of urgency:** Use strong verbs and short sentences to convey the ticking clock.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the organ is a crucial turning point, raising the stakes significantly. The phrase "vital only static shape"  immediately conveys the seriousness of Henry's condition.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The specific time ("08:57") and the helicopter's arrival create a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Lack of Detail:**  We don't know how the medical team reacts to the organ's arrival, or what challenges they might face in getting it to Henry. This lack of detail prevents the suspense from reaching its full potential.
* **Awkward Phrasing:** The sentence structure is a bit clunky ("whirlybird carry the hammond organ set down duly on the ceiling"). This detracts from the overall impact.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Henry's condition, describe his physical state, his labored breathing, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Focus on the organ:** Describe its appearance, the delicate nature of the transplant, the potential for complications.
* **Build tension:** Use shorter sentences, more active verbs, and sensory details to create a sense of anticipation and dread.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The urgency of the situation is clear – a life depends on the timely delivery of the liver.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the helicopter's rotor, the wind, and the men's actions creates a vivid and immersive experience.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph uses short sentences and active verbs to create a sense of urgency and momentum.
* **Unanswered Questions:** We don't know what the man shouted, or what challenges they might face getting the liver to the patient. This leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**To increase the suspense further, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on the internal thoughts of the men:** What are they thinking and feeling as they race against time?
* **Introduce a potential obstacle:** Perhaps there's a traffic jam, a security checkpoint, or a sudden storm.
* **Heighten the sensory details:** Describe the smell of antiseptic in the hospital, the frantic pace of the medical staff, the sound of Henry's labored breathing.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There are no immediate threats, obstacles, or mysteries.
* **Passive Voice:** The frequent use of passive voice ("the floor was mopped," "the corridor was cleaned") makes the action feel distant and uneventful.
* **Focus on the Ordinary:** The details are very specific and ordinary – the type of mop, the placement of the fire extinguisher, the time it takes to clean. This lack of intrigue prevents the reader from becoming invested.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce an anomaly:** Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, like a hidden door or a strange message.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Describe the stairwell in a more unsettling way – dark, echoing, with flickering lights.
* **Hint at a hidden danger:**  Mention a rumor about the stairwell, or a feeling of being watched.
* **Shift the perspective:** Tell the story from the point of view of someone else in the hospital, who might be aware of a threat related to the stairwell.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setting:** The description of the helipad exit, service stairwell, and secondary corridor creates a sense of place and suggests a hidden or less-traveled part of the hospital.
* **Dialogue Hints at Tension:** The conversation between the two men suggests a sense of urgency and a need to make quick decisions.
* **Lack of Clarity:** We don't know why the patient is on the sixth floor, or what the potential consequences are if they don't get there quickly. This lack of context prevents the suspense from building fully.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the situation is urgent, but it doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or the characters' actions.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show the characters' physical reactions:** Are they sweating, breathing heavily, their hands shaking?
* **Use sensory details to create a sense of urgency:** Describe the sound of their footsteps echoing in the stairwell, the smell of antiseptic in the air, the ticking of a clock.
