I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening lines establish a real-life event with high stakes (a life-saving transplant). This immediately piques curiosity.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph highlights the urgency of the situation ("decisive situation," "impendent liver transplant," "not sure if Robert would survive the wait"). 
* **Lack of Narrative Drive:**  The paragraph primarily focuses on providing factual information rather than driving a narrative. We know the transplant was successful, which removes a lot of the suspense.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The writing relies heavily on telling us about the situation ("they were not sure," "his situation was decisive") instead of showing us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his fear, hope, or pain.
* **Highlight the challenges:**  Mention complications, doubts from the medical team, or external factors threatening the transplant.
* **Create a sense of uncertainty:**  Leave the outcome ambiguous until the very end.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The specific time ("08:57") and the arrival of the organ by helicopter create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Vivid Imagery:**  "Whirlybird," "pipe organ," and "decisive simply static consideration" are strong, evocative words that paint a picture in the reader's mind.
* **Lack of Context:** We don't know enough about Robert's condition or the risks involved in the transplant. This lack of context makes it harder to fully invest in the suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the whirlybird carry the pipe organ") makes the writing feel less immediate and engaging.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Show Robert's reaction:**  Describe his fear, hope, or anticipation as the helicopter arrives.
* **Highlight the fragility of the situation:** Mention the organ's delicate nature or the potential for complications.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful nature of the cleaning job. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or conflict.
* **Lack of Character Development:** We learn very little about the cleaner, his motivations, or his thoughts. This makes it difficult to connect with him or care about what might happen.
* **Predictable Plot:** The paragraph follows a clear and predictable pattern: clean the stairwell, take the lift down, collect supplies, continue working. There are no surprises or twists.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce an anomaly:**  Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, like a hidden door or a strange message.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Describe the stairwell in a more unsettling way, emphasizing its darkness, emptiness, or isolation.
* **Hint at a threat:**  Mention a security breach, a suspicious character, or a recent incident in the hospital.
