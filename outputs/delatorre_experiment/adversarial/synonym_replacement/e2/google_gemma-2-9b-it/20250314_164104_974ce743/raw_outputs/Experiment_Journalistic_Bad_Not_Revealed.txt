I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a pending organ transplant immediately grabs the reader's attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The paragraph clearly establishes the high stakes involved – Henry's life hangs in the balance.
* **Lack of Detail:**  The paragraph is very general. We don't know *why* Henry's condition is critical, what specific challenges they face, or any hints about what might go wrong. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Henry's situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the hospital atmosphere, Henry's appearance, the sounds of the medical equipment.
* **Focus on character emotions:** Show the fear, hope, and desperation of the medical team and Henry's family.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Introduce a small detail that suggests something might go wrong with the transplant.
* **End on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a question or a sense of unease about what might happen next.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Elements:** The mention of an "electric organ" and the specific time create a sense of mystery and urgency.
* **Unclear Context:** The language is very vague and confusing. We don't know what an "electric organ" is in this context, or what "decisive merely unchanging shape" means. 
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** The paragraph is devoid of any emotional impact. We don't feel anything for Henry or the situation.
* **Awkward Phrasing:** The sentence structure is clunky and grammatically incorrect, which detracts from the overall effect.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Clarify the "electric organ":** Is it a medical device? A metaphor?  Explain it in a way that makes sense to the reader.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying Henry is in a "decisive merely unchanging shape," describe his physical state in a way that conveys his vulnerability and the gravity of the situation.
* **Add Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds, smells, and atmosphere of the hospital to create a more immersive experience.
* **Focus on Character Reactions:** Show the emotions of the medical team as they bring in the organ. Are they hopeful? Nervous?

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Imagery:** The image of a "humble blue sky electric refrigerator" carrying a functioning liver is unusual and immediately grabs attention.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase "2 piece fall from the chopper" suggests a hurried and potentially dangerous delivery.
* **Unclear Stakes:** While we know the liver is important, the paragraph doesn't clearly establish the urgency or the potential consequences if something goes wrong.
* **Awkward Phrasing:** The language is still somewhat clunky and confusing.  

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Connect the Liver to Henry:**  Explicitly state that this liver is for Henry, and that his life depends on its safe arrival.
* **Highlight the Risks:**  Describe the dangers of transporting a vital organ, perhaps mentioning bad weather, traffic, or mechanical issues.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying the liver is "in full functioning," describe its appearance or the sounds it makes to create a more visceral sense of its importance.
