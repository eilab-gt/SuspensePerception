I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and uncertainty, which are key elements of suspense. The reader is told that a critical event is about to unfold, and that the outcome is uncertain. The use of phrases like "close at hand" and "critical" creates a sense of urgency, and the fact that the patient's life is hanging in the balance raises the stakes.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by its dry, factual tone. The use of formal language and medical jargon ("veridical case", "UCSF Benioff Kid's reciprocal ohm Infirmary", "aesculapian team") creates a sense of detachment, which makes it harder for the reader to become emotionally invested in the story. Additionally, the paragraph's focus on setting up the context and providing background information slows down the pace of the narrative, which reduces the sense of tension and suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some sense of suspense, it could be more effective in building tension and creating a sense of urgency if it were written in a more engaging and emotive style.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is much more suspenseful than the previous one because it creates a sense of sudden and intense action. The use of words like "whirlybird" (a colloquialism for a helicopter) and "shoot down" creates a sense of urgency and drama, and the image of a helicopter landing on the ceiling of the hospital is unexpected and startling.

The phrase "Henry m. robert Set exist in a decisive just unchanging status" is also suspenseful because it implies that Robert's condition is critical and that time is of the essence. The use of words like "decisive" and "unchanging" creates a sense of gravity and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder what will happen next.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that it's a bit hard to follow due to some grammatical errors and unusual word choices. For example, "bear the harmonium" is a strange phrase that doesn't quite make sense, and "Henry m. robert Set exist" should probably be "Henry Robert was in" or something similar. If the paragraph were written more clearly and concisely, it would be even more effective at building suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a vivid and intense scene that puts the reader right in the midst of the action. The use of sensory details like the "whirlwind of the spinning blades", "oral sex down and hair blown", and "noise of the brand" creates a sense of chaos and urgency, and the image of the two men descending from the helicopter with a precious cargo is thrilling.

The paragraph also expertly builds tension by creating a sense of time pressure. The men are on a mission to deliver a liver to a patient who is in a "vital post" and "they had no time to lose". This creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder if they will make it in time.

The use of body language and non-verbal communication, such as the man pointing at his watch and then at the doorway, adds to the sense of tension and creates a sense of silent understanding between the two characters. The fact that the gentleman's words are "unhearable" due to the noise of the helicopter also adds to the sense of drama and intensity.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being perfect is some minor errors in grammar and spelling, such as "oral sex down" (should be "heads down"), "hollo" (should be "hollered"), and "radiocarpal joint" (should be "wrist"). However, these errors do not detract from the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.

This paragraph is not suspenseful at all. In fact, it's quite the opposite - it's a very mundane and ordinary description of a cleaner's daily routine.

The reader is not left wondering what will happen next or feeling any sense of tension or anxiety.
