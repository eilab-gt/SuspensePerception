I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a life-or-death situation (a liver transplant) and a critical patient (Henry Robert Bent) who may not survive the wait. The use of phrases like "imminent liver transplantation" and "his condition was critical" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Henry Robert Bent receive the transplant in time?" and "Will he survive?"

However, the paragraph also provides some resolution by stating that a worthy donor had been found, which reduces the sense of uncertainty and tension. Additionally, the paragraph's tone is more informative and matter-of-fact than suspenseful, which detracts from the overall sense of suspense.

To increase the suspensefulness of the paragraph, the author could have omitted the detail about the donor being found, or introduced more obstacles or complications that threaten Henry Robert Bent's chances of survival.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation by describing the arrival of the organ at the hospital, which is a critical moment in Henry Robert Bent's story. The use of specific details like the time ("08:57") and the phrase "decisive moment" creates a sense of urgency and importance.

The sentence structure is also effective in building suspense, with a sense of anticipation created by the phrase "the helicopter carry the electric organ bring down duly" and then a pause before the revelation of the location "on the cap of the infirmary". This creates a sense of drama and tension.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still somewhat informative and lacks a sense of immediate danger or threat. The phrase "decisive merely unchanging shape" is also a bit unclear, which may reduce the sense of tension. If the paragraph had introduced more uncertainty or danger, such as a complication with the organ or a problem with the helicopter, it could have been even more suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of high stakes and tension. The image of two people falling from a helicopter is inherently dramatic and dangerous, and the fact that one of them is carrying a vital organ (the liver) in a special casing adds to the sense of urgency.

The use of specific details like the "humble blue sky electric refrigerator" creates a vivid image in the reader's mind, and the phrase "in the material body of a casing" adds to the sense of tension and importance. The fact that the liver is "fully functioning" also raises the stakes, as it implies that Henry Robert Bent's life depends on this organ.

The paragraph also creates a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to the people who fell from the helicopter, and whether the liver will be damaged or compromised in some way. The use of short, simple sentences adds to the sense of urgency and drama, making this paragraph extremely suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful because it seems to be describing a mundane and unrelated event (a janitor cleaning the floor) rather than advancing the plot or creating tension. The phrase "Minute in the first place" is unclear and doesn't add to the sense of suspense.

The mention of the "avail stairwell" and the "cockeyed storey" foretoken is somewhat mysterious, but it's not clear what these terms mean or how they relate to the story. Without more context, it's difficult to understand the significance of these details, and they don't create a sense of tension or anticipation.

Overall, this paragraph seems to be a non-sequitur and doesn't contribute to the suspense or tension of the story. It may be intended to be a red herring or a distraction, but without more context, it falls flat.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph creates some suspense because it describes the characters taking a risk by using the "help stairwell" instead of a more conventional route. The use of the word "adjudicate" implies that they are making a deliberate decision to take this route, which adds to the sense of tension.

The fact that they are carrying the liver, which is a vital organ, adds to the sense of importance and raises the stakes. The use of the phrase "air pile" is unclear, but it could imply that they are taking a risk by using a potentially unsafe or unconventional route.

However, the paragraph is still somewhat lacking in suspense because it doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or threat. The characters seem to be taking a calculated risk, but it's not clear what the consequences of their actions will be. Additionally, the paragraph is still somewhat informative and lacks a sense of urgency or tension.

To increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph, the author could have added more details about the risks of taking the help stairwell, or introduced an obstacle or complication that the characters need to overcome.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of sudden and unexpected danger. The image of the person dropping the casing, which contains the vital liver, is shocking and raises the stakes immediately. The use of the phrase "steep downwardly the stair" creates a vivid image of the casing falling down the stairs, which adds to the sense of tension and urgency.

The paragraph also creates a sense of chaos and unpredictability, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to the liver and whether it will be damaged or compromised in some way. The use of the phrase "as a effect" implies that this is a direct consequence of the characters' actions, which adds to the sense of tension and responsibility.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still somewhat lacking in emotional resonance. The reader is not yet fully invested in the characters or the situation, so the sense of suspense is not yet fully realized. However, this paragraph is still very effective in creating a sense of tension and anticipation, and it sets the stage for further suspenseful events to unfold.

Overall, this paragraph is extremely effective in creating a sense of suspense and tension, and it sets the stage for a dramatic and intense conclusion.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is somewhat suspenseful because it creates a sense of anticipation and resolution. The fact that the doctor is arriving quickly implies that the situation is urgent and that the doctor's arrival is crucial to resolving the crisis.

However, the paragraph is also somewhat anticlimactic because it doesn't provide any new information or complications. The reader is left wondering what will happen when the doctor arrives, but the paragraph doesn't create a sense of tension or uncertainty.

To increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph, the author could have added more details about the doctor's arrival, such as the doctor's expression or the sound of footsteps. Alternatively, the author could have introduced a new complication or obstacle that the doctor must overcome, which would add to the sense of tension and suspense.

Overall, while this paragraph is somewhat suspenseful, it feels more like a transition or a setup for the next scene rather than a suspenseful moment in its own right.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of shock and surprise. The revelation that the "home bagful" (presumably the container holding the liver) has burst is a dramatic and intense moment that raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful because it seems to be a procedural and informative passage rather than a dramatic or intense moment. The language used is technical and medical, which creates a sense of detachment and removes the emotional resonance from the scene.

The paragraph describes a series of actions that are necessary to determine the status of the liver, but it doesn't create a sense of tension or uncertainty. The use of words like "contract", "creditworthy", and "meditate" creates a sense of formality and detachment, which reduces the suspense.

Additionally, the paragraph doesn't raise any questions or create a sense of anticipation. The reader is simply being informed of the next step in the process, rather than being drawn into a dramatic or intense moment.

To increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph, the author could have added more emotional resonance, created a sense of tension or uncertainty, or introduced a complication or obstacle that the characters need to overcome.

The use of the phrase "out of the question" implies a sense of finality and hopelessness, which adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and whether Henry Robert Bent will be able to receive a transplant in time.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is somewhat straightforward and lacks a sense of complexity or surprise. The reader may have anticipated that the liver would be damaged or unusable, given the events of the previous paragraphs. To increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph, the author could have added more twists or complications, or introduced a new obstacle or challenge that the characters need to overcome.
