I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a dramatic and intense situation, with a young boy's life hanging in the balance as he waits for a liver transplant. The use of specific details, such as the date and time, adds to the sense of realism and raises the stakes. The phrase "his life cost vital" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Henry survive?" and "What will happen next?"

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by the fact that it's presented as a "tale of a real consequence" and the reader is told upfront that they are about to read a story about what happened. This framing device takes some of the edge off the suspense, as the reader knows that the events have already unfolded and that the outcome is already known. Additionally, the paragraph's somewhat formal and clinical tone, which is likely due to the medical setting, also reduces the sense of suspense and tension.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is very effective in creating suspense because it's a moment of high tension and anticipation. The use of specific details, such as the exact time and the sound of the helicopter ("whirlybird"), creates a vivid and immersive scene. The phrase "vital only static shape" is particularly effective in conveying the gravity of Henry's situation and creating a sense of urgency.

The suspense comes from the fact that the reader is waiting for the transplant to happen, and this paragraph is the moment of truth. The use of words like "duly" and "set down" creates a sense of anticipation and expectation, and the reader is left wondering if the transplant will be successful, if Henry will survive, and what will happen next.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is quite short and doesn't have a lot of build-up or complexity. The suspense is largely dependent on the context established in the previous paragraph, and the paragraph itself is more of a "moment of truth" than a sustained build-up of tension.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is masterfully crafted to create a sense of urgency, tension, and suspense. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "top dog downward and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning vane", creates a sense of chaos and intensity. The image of the two men emerging from the helicopter, one clutching the precious liver, is a powerful and suspenseful moment.

The paragraph expertly builds tension through the use of small details, such as the man's inability to be heard over the noise of the blades, and the gesture of touching his fellow worker on the shoulder to communicate. The sense of urgency is palpable, and the reader is left wondering if they will make it to the patient in time.

The phrase "the patient exist in a vital situation and they had no time to drop off" is particularly effective in ratcheting up the tension, as it creates a sense of countdown and raises the stakes. The use of words like "vital" and "no time to drop off" creates a sense of desperation and raises the question of whether Henry will survive.

Overall, this paragraph is a masterclass in building suspense, and it's hard to imagine a more effective way to create tension and anticipation in the reader.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is quite the opposite of the previous ones in terms of suspensefulness. It's a slow-paced, descriptive passage that focuses on the mundane routine of a hospital cleaner. The language is calm and matter-of-fact, with no sense of urgency or tension. The use of words like "agreeable" and "enjoyable" creates a sense of relaxation, and the image of the cleaner whistling as he works is a peaceful one.

The paragraph is more focused on setting a scene and establishing the cleaner's daily routine than on creating suspense. There's no sense of anticipation or uncertainty, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next. The passage is more of a character study or a descriptive piece than a suspenseful scene.

The only potential hint of suspense comes from the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to put up "wet floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident. However, this is not played up as a source of tension, and the paragraph ends with the cleaner going about his usual day without any sense of drama or urgency. Overall, this paragraph is a calm and peaceful interlude that does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is a significant improvement over the previous one in terms of suspensefulness. The language is more concise and focused, and the scene is set in a more urgent and time-sensitive context. The use of words like "under binding" and "now" creates a sense of immediacy, and the image of the person carrying the liver case is a powerful one.

The dialogue between the two men is also effective in creating tension, as it reveals the urgency of the situation and the need to move quickly. The phrase "it's not worth taking the lift" creates a sense of urgency, and the calculation of time ("it'll take longer than walking down two floors") adds to the sense of pressure.

The paragraph also creates a sense of anticipation, as the reader is left wondering what will happen when they reach the sixth floor and the patient. The use of words like "finally" and "round a crimp at the end of the corridor" creates a sense of progression and movement, and the image of the east wing elevator waiting at the end of the corridor is a tantalizing one.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a higher rating is that the paragraph is still somewhat focused on setting the scene and establishing the layout of the hospital, which slows down the pace of the narrative. Additionally, the tension and suspense are not yet at a fever pitch, and the paragraph could benefit from a more dramatic or intense moment to really ratchet up the suspense.

The phrase "the two men gave their hint as they watched in horror" is particularly effective in conveying the sense of shock and dread that the characters are feeling, and the use of the word "horror" adds to the sense of intensity and suspense.

The paragraph is expertly paced, with a slow build-up of tension followed by a sudden and dramatic release. The language is concise and focused, and the scene is set in a way that creates a sense of immediacy and urgency.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is still quite suspenseful, but it's a slight step down from the previous one. The language is still concise and focused, and the scene is set in a way that creates a sense of urgency and tension.

The moment when the case finally stops rolling and the two men approach it is a tense one, and the dialogue between them is effective in conveying their caution and concern.

The paragraph also creates a sense of anticipation, as the reader is left wondering if the liver has been damaged and what will happen next. The use of words like "in case anyone comes" adds to the sense of tension, and the image of the man hurrying down the stairs and through the corridors is a suspenseful one.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is slightly more focused on setting the scene and establishing the characters' actions than on creating a sense of intense suspense. The language is still quite descriptive, but it's not as vivid or evocative as in the previous paragraph. Additionally, the paragraph is slightly more predictable, as the reader can anticipate that the man will go to alert the medical team. Overall, however, this is still a very suspenseful paragraph that effectively builds on the tension established in the previous one.
