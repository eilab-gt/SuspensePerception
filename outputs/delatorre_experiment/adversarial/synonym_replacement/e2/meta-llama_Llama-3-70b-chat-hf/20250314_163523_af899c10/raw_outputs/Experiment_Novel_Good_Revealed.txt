I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation by introducing a life-or-death scenario (a liver transplant) and creating uncertainty about the outcome (will Robert survive the wait?). The use of specific details like the date, time, and location adds a sense of realism and immediacy, which can contribute to suspense.

However, the paragraph also gives away the outcome of the story (the transplant is successful) relatively early on, which reduces the suspense. The sentence "This is the story of what happened" also feels like a spoiler, as it implies that the story is going to be a straightforward retelling of events rather than a tense, suspenseful narrative.

To increase the suspensefulness of the paragraph, the author could have withheld the outcome of the transplant until later in the story, or introduced more obstacles or complications to create tension.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is very effective at creating suspense because it:

* Creates a sense of urgency with the specific time "08:57"
* Introduces a dramatic and critical moment (the arrival of the organ for the transplant)
* Uses vivid and dynamic language like "whirlybird" to create a sense of excitement and tension
* Emphasizes the critical condition of the patient ("decisive simply static consideration") to raise the stakes

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that it's a relatively short paragraph, and the suspense is somewhat contained within a single moment. To take it to the next level, the author could have added more context or hints about what might go wrong, or introduced more tension or conflict to sustain the suspense over a longer period. Nonetheless, this paragraph is very effective at creating a sense of tension and anticipation.

This paragraph is extremely effective at creating suspense because it:

* Creates a vivid and intense scene with the helicopter arrival, using sensory details like the "whirlwind of the spinning blade" and the men's hair being blown back

The paragraph is also well-paced, with a good balance of action, description, and dialogue. The use of short sentences and phrases adds to the sense of urgency and creates a sense of breathlessness. Overall, this paragraph is extremely effective at creating a sense of suspense and tension, and it's hard to imagine how it could be improved.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is not suspenseful for several reasons:

* The scene is mundane and ordinary, with a janitor doing his daily cleaning routine. There's no sense of urgency or high stakes.
* The language is descriptive but not dramatic or tense. The use of words like "agreeable" and "enjoyable" creates a sense of calmness and normalcy.
* The paragraph focuses on the janitor's routine and his thoughts, which are not particularly interesting or suspenseful.
* There's no sense of conflict, danger, or uncertainty. The janitor is simply doing his job, and everything seems to be going smoothly.
* The paragraph is quite long and meandering, which makes it feel more like a character study or a descriptive passage than a suspenseful scene.

Overall, this paragraph is more focused on setting a scene and establishing a character's daily routine than on creating suspense or tension. It's a slow-burning, atmospheric passage that doesn't seem to be building towards anything dramatic or suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is suspenseful because:

* It creates a sense of urgency and importance with the arrival of the liver and the critical condition of the patient

* The language is not particularly dramatic or evocative, which reduces the sense of urgency and importance

Overall, this paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be more effective at creating tension and suspense with more dramatic language and a greater sense of conflict or uncertainty.
