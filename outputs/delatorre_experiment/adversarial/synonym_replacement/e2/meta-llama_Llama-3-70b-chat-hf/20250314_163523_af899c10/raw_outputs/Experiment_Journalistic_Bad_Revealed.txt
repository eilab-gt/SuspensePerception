I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing a critical medical situation, a liver transplant, and the uncertainty of the patient's survival. The use of phrases like "decisive" and "without having been capable to carry out the liver transplantation" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert survive?" and "What happened to the organ during transportation?"

However, the suspense is somewhat diminished by the fact that the outcome is revealed relatively early on, namely that Robert Bent dies without receiving the transplant. This reduces the sense of uncertainty and tension, making the paragraph more of a tragic anecdote than a suspenseful thriller.

Additionally, the writing style and grammar errors ("What you be about to read be", "follow not sure", "This follow the storey of what find") detract from the overall impact of the paragraph, making it harder to become fully invested in the story.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and tension by describing a critical moment in the story, the arrival of the organ for the transplant. The use of specific details like the time "08:57" and the location "on the cap of the infirmary" creates a sense of immediacy and raises the stakes.

The phrase "Henry martyn robert Knack be in a decisive simply static experimental condition" is also effective in creating suspense, as it implies that Robert's situation is critical and that time is of the essence. The use of words like "decisive" and "static" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the organ arrive in time?" and "Will Robert survive?"

However, the suspense is somewhat diminished by the fact that the paragraph is quite short and lacks a sense of build-up or escalation. The sentence structure is also quite simple, which makes the paragraph feel a bit flat and lacking in tension.

Overall, while the paragraph is suspenseful, it could be more effective with some additional build-up and more complex sentence structures to create a greater sense of tension and anticipation.
