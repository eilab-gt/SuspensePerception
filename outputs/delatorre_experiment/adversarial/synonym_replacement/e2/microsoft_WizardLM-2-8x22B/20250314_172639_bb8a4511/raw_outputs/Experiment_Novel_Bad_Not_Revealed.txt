The paragraph sets up a scenario with inherent tension—a young boy in need of an urgent liver transplant—and mentions the uncertainty of whether he would survive long enough for the operation, which are key elements for creating suspense. The specificity of the date and location, as well as the personal detail of the boy's name, add to the realism and gravity of the situation. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph serves as a introduction to a reported event, suggesting that the reader is about to learn the outcome, which reduces the tension slightly. The suspensefulness would likely be higher if the paragraph ended with a more immediate cliffhanger or a question that leaves the reader more uncertain about the outcome.

This paragraph introduces a potential element of suspense with the cleaner's routine of mopping the stairwell and not placing "wet floor" signs, which could lead to an accident under the wrong circumstances. However, the suspense is quite mild because there is no immediate threat or indication that this detail will have any direct impact on the urgent situation unfolding with Henry's liver transplant. The paragraph is more focused on setting the scene and providing background information about the cleaner's daily routine, which, while it may contribute to the overall context, does not in itself create a strong sense of tension or danger. The reader might anticipate that the mopped floors could become relevant in a negative way, but without a more direct connection to the main plotline, the suspense remains relatively low.

The specific mention of the distance they need to cover ("two flights of stairs") and the fact that they are carrying something as delicate and critical as a human liver in a cooler contributes to the tension. The reader is likely to feel anxious about whether the men will navigate the stairs quickly enough and whether any unforeseen events will occur during their descent to the sixth floor.
