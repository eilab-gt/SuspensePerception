The paragraph sets up a scenario with potentially high stakes—a liver transplant for a young boy whose condition is critical. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before and the uncertainty of whether the boy will survive until the organ arrives creates a sense of urgency and anticipation. The specific details, such as the time and location, add to the credibility and gravity of the situation. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph serves as an introduction to a story rather than placing the reader in the midst of a tense, unfolding event. The suspensefulness could be heightened with more immediate descriptions of the tension and emotions experienced by the characters involved, or by hinting at potential complications that could arise.

This paragraph increases the suspense by introducing a specific, critical moment in the story—the arrival of the helicopter carrying the liver for transplant. The precise timing given ("08: fifty seven") suggests an immediacy and importance that can heighten the reader's sense of anticipation. The mention of Henry M. Robert's "decisive yet unchanging status" creates a tension between the potential for change (decisive) and the current stability (unchanging), which can leave the reader wondering whether the boy's condition will hold or deteriorate before the organ can be transplanted. The use of the word "duly" also implies that events are proceeding as expected, but in high-stakes medical situations, the expected can quickly become the unexpected, adding to the suspense. The paragraph effectively builds on the initial setup and maintains the reader's engagement in the outcome.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense. It vividly describes the urgent arrival of the helicopter, the careful transport of the life-saving organ in a blue case, and the communication challenges due to the noise of the rotors. The specific detail of the liver being stored at four degrees centigrade to maintain its functionality adds to the realism and critical nature of the situation. The interaction between the two men, with one unable to be heard over the noise and resorting to gestures, conveys a sense of urgency and the high stakes involved. The phrase "the patient role was in a vital post and they had no time to lose" underscores the immediacy and seriousness of the boy's condition. The reader is left in suspense about whether the team will be able to act quickly enough and whether any unforeseen complications will arise during the transport of the liver to the operating room. This paragraph effectively keeps the reader on edge, wondering about the outcome.

This paragraph is relatively low in suspense. It provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine work in the service stairwell of the hospital, emphasizing the mundane and repetitive nature of the job. The description of the cleaner's tasks, his interactions, and his habits paints a picture of a quiet, uneventful morning. The mention of the cleaner not using "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but this is not directly tied to the urgent medical situation described in the previous paragraphs. The suspense is diluted by the focus on the cleaner's perspective and the lack of immediate connection to the critical events concerning Henry M. Robert's liver transplant. While the paragraph contributes to the setting and atmosphere of the hospital, it does not significantly heighten the tension or anticipation related to the main plotline.

This paragraph introduces a sense of urgency and decision-making that adds a layer of suspense to the narrative. The specific details about the layout of the hospital and the choice between taking the stairs or the elevator create a scenario where time is of the essence. The advice to avoid the elevator due to potential delays and the subsequent action of the colleague opting for the stairs suggests that every second counts. The mention of the "east wing lift" and the "sixth floor" provides concrete locations that help the reader visualize the path the characters must take, which can increase tension as the reader mentally follows their progress. However, the suspense is somewhat tempered by the calm and calculated nature of the interaction between the two men; they are making rational choices rather than reacting to immediate danger or complications. The paragraph effectively maintains a sense of urgency but does not escalate the suspense to a high level, as it lacks immediate threats or uncertainties that would significantly raise the stakes.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense. The sudden accident, with one of the men carrying the liver case twisting his ankle and losing his balance, introduces an immediate and unexpected threat to the mission's success. The vivid description of the case rolling down the stairs while the man struggles to regain his footing creates a heart-stopping moment where the precious cargo is in jeopardy. The sensory details, such as the sound of the case hitting each step, add to the intensity of the scene. The reader is left holding their breath, wondering if the case will be damaged and if the organ inside will still be viable for the transplant. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which are key elements for creating suspense. This paragraph effectively places the reader in the moment, sharing the anxiety and urgency of the situation with the characters involved.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The moment of truth as the case comes to a stop at the bottom of the stairs sets the stage for a critical assessment of the situation. The warning from one man to the other not to touch the case for fear of damaging the contents further heightens the tension, as it suggests the possibility that the liver may have been compromised during the fall. The decision to leave one person behind to guard the case while the other rushes to alert the medical team adds to the sense of urgency. The detailed description of the second man's careful descent and hurried navigation through the hospital corridors keeps the reader engaged and anxious about the outcome. The paragraph effectively conveys the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences should the organ be unusable, leaving the reader in suspense about whether the transplant will proceed as planned or if there will be a tragic setback.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense. The colleague's immobility and internal struggle, combined with his concern for the liver's condition, create a tense atmosphere. The description of his physical discomfort and superstitious thoughts adds depth to the scene, reflecting the emotional weight of the situation. The arrival of the medical team, urgently ascending the stairwell, introduces a new dynamic and a shift in action. The request for the man to move aside as the doctors assess the case heightens the anticipation for the reader, who is eager to learn the fate of the liver and its suitability for transplant. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader in suspense, focused on the critical moment that will determine the success or failure of the entire operation.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The moment of revelation as the doctor opens the case to assess the condition of the liver is a critical point in the narrative. The subtle sound of the case being opened ("a clink") and the doctor's immediate reaction after a brief glance inside create a palpable sense of tension. The description of the damaged electric refrigerator and the escaping refrigerated air indicates that the organ may have been compromised, which raises the stakes significantly. The reader is left in suspense, as the doctor's head shake suggests a negative outcome, but the paragraph does not provide a definitive conclusion about the viability of the liver. This lack of resolution, combined with the clear indication that something has gone wrong, keeps the reader on edge, eager to discover the implications for the urgent transplant surgery that awaits.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. It places the reader directly into a high-stakes medical procedure where the precision and skill of the surgeon are critical to the success of the transplant. The detailed description of the careful process of examining the liver, including the measurement of enzyme activity and the preparation for a biopsy, underscores the delicate nature of the situation. The surgeon's heightened awareness and the gravity of his responsibility—having a child's life in his hands—add to the tension. The mention of the potential for irreparable damage with even a slight miscalculation creates a sense of dread and anticipation. The reader is likely to be holding their breath, fully invested in the outcome of the biopsy and the fate of the young patient. This paragraph effectively conveys the pressure and urgency of the moment, making it highly suspenseful.

This paragraph maintains the high level of suspense established in the previous one. The surgeon's careful insertion of the needle and the successful extraction of the specimen are described in a way that keeps the reader fully engaged. The tension is palpable as the surgeon hands off the sample, and the colleague prepares it for microscopic examination. The surgeon's physical reaction—wiping sweat from his brow—highlights the intensity of the moment. The colleague's focused yet cryptic behavior while examining the sample, including his expressions and pauses, adds to the suspense. The reader is kept in a state of anticipation, waiting for the verdict on the liver's condition. The revelation that the organ's metabolic rate is normal and that it has not been damaged provides a moment of relief, but the paragraph ends before the full impact of this news is known, leaving the reader on edge and eager to learn the implications for the transplant surgery.

This paragraph provides a significant moment of relief and resolution, which is satisfying after the buildup of suspense. The confirmation that Henry M. Robert's new liver is functioning correctly and has not been adversely affected by the earlier mishap is a critical turning point in the narrative. The specificity of the time ("twenty one: xxvi") adds to the sense of urgency and the real-time unfolding of events. While the suspense is somewhat resolved with the positive news, the paragraph still maintains a level of tension due to the high stakes involved and the potential for complications that can arise in medical scenarios, even after a successful procedure. The reader's concern for the young patient's well-being keeps the suspense level high, as there is a lingering awareness that the journey is not yet complete—post-operative recovery is a critical phase as well. Overall, the paragraph effectively balances the relief of a positive outcome with the ongoing tension typical of a medical drama.
