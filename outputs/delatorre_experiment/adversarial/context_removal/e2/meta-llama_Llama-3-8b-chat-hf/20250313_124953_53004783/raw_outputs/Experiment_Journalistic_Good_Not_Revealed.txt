I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and expectation by mentioning the imminent liver transplant and the waiting for the arrival of the organ. However, it doesn't create a sense of tension or urgency, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which reduces the suspenseful effect. To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could include more dramatic language, create a sense of uncertainty or danger, or hint at a twist or surprise.

The use of the word "punctually" also implies a sense of precision and timing, which adds to the suspense.
