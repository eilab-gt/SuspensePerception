I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and expectation by mentioning the imminent liver transplant and the waiting for the arrival of the organ. However, the tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, rather than ominous or foreboding, which is typical of suspenseful writing. The paragraph also doesn't introduce any conflicts, twists, or surprises, which are common elements of suspenseful storytelling. Overall, while the paragraph is engaging and sets up a sense of tension, it doesn't have the same level of suspense as a more dramatic or thrilling narrative.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation by describing the scene in vivid detail, using words like "whirlwind", "blown", and "inaudible" to convey the chaos and noise of the helicopter's arrival. The use of the word "compatible" to describe the liver also implies a sense of urgency and importance. The dialogue between the two men is also effective in creating suspense, as it suggests that they are trying to communicate something important, but the noise of the helicopter is making it difficult.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is a detailed and mundane description of a cleaner's routine, with no hint of tension, conflict, or surprise. The use of words like "agreeable" and "whistled" to describe the cleaner's job creates a sense of calm and normalcy, and the fact that the service stairwell is not dirty and doesn't need a thorough clean makes it seem like a routine and uneventful task. The paragraph is more of a descriptive passage than a suspenseful one, and it doesn't create any sense of anticipation or tension. The only thing that might be slightly interesting is the fact that the cleaner didn't put up the "wet floor" warning signs, but even that is presented in a matter-of-fact way and doesn't create any sense of foreboding or danger. Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful at all.

The fact that the man is holding on to the case and trying to recover his balance adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The image of the case rolling down the stairs also creates a sense of chaos and unpredictability, which adds to the suspense.
