I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and expectation by mentioning the imminent liver transplant and the waiting for the arrival of the organ. However, it doesn't create a sense of tension or urgency, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which reduces the suspensefulness of the paragraph. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have created more tension by hinting at potential complications or obstacles that might arise during the transplant.
