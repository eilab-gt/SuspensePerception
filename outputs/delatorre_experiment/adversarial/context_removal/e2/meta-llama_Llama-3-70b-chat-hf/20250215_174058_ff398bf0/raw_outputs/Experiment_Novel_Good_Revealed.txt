I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. This paragraph creates a more vivid and immersive scene than the previous ones, which helps to build tension and suspense. The use of sensory details like the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the men's hair being blown back creates a sense of urgency and energy.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. This paragraph is quite mundane and lacks any sense of tension or suspense. The description of the cleaner's routine is detailed and ordinary, and the use of phrases like "it wasn't a particularly interesting job" and "agreeable job" creates a sense of normalcy and routine.
