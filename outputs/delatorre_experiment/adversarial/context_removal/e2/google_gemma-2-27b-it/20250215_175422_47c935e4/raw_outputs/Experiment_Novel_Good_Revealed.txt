I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It sets up a situation with potential for suspense:** A child needing a liver transplant is inherently a high-stakes situation.
* **It mentions a time-sensitive event:** The waiting for the organ and the verification of its functionality create a sense of urgency.
* **However, it lacks immediate tension:** The paragraph mostly focuses on factual information and doesn't introduce any immediate threats or conflicts. The outcome (the transplant being successful) is revealed upfront.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on Robert's emotional state:** How is he feeling while waiting? Is he scared? Hopeful?
* **Introduce potential complications:**  Hint at possible risks during the transplant or the journey of the organ.
* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader wondering about the success of the transplant until later in the story.

* **Describe the atmosphere:** Is there tension in the air? Are people anxiously waiting?
* **Focus on Robert's condition:** Is he getting worse? Is his time running out?
* **Hint at potential problems:**  Maybe the weather is bad, or there's a delay in getting the organ to the operating room.

Here's why:
