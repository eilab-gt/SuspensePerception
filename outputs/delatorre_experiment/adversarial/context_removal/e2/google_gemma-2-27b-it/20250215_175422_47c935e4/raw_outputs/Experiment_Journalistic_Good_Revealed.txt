* **It mentions a time-sensitive event:** The waiting for the organ and the verification of its functionality create a sense of urgency.
* **However, it lacks immediate tension:** The paragraph mostly focuses on factual information and doesn't introduce any immediate threats or conflicts. The outcome (the transplant being successful) is revealed upfront.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on Robert's emotional state:** How is he feeling while waiting? Is he scared? Hopeful?
* **Introduce potential complications:**  Hint at possible risks during the transplant or the journey of the organ.
* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader wondering about the success of the transplant until later in the story.
