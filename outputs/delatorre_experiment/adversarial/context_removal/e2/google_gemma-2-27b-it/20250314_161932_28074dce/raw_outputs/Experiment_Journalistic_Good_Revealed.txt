I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It sets up a situation with potential for suspense:** A child needing a liver transplant is inherently a high-stakes situation.
* **It uses a factual tone:** The emphasis on the real event and specific details (date, time) creates a sense of realism that could draw the reader in.
* **However, it reveals the outcome too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right away. This removes the immediate tension of wondering if Robert will survive.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:**  Focus on the waiting and anxiety leading up to the transplant.
* **Introduce potential complications:** Hint at possible risks or challenges during the procedure.
* **Use more evocative language:**  Create a sense of urgency and emotional investment in Robert's situation.
