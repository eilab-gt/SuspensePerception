I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity. The mention of a liver transplant adds a layer of seriousness and potential drama.
* **Limited Tension:** While the paragraph establishes a situation with stakes (a child needing a transplant), it lacks immediate tension or a clear threat. We know the transplant is imminent, but there's no sense of urgency or impending danger.
* **Promise of More:** The final sentence, "This is the story of what happened,"  suggests that something significant and potentially suspenseful is about to unfold, but it doesn't deliver any immediate thrills.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Introduce a complication:**  Hint at a potential problem with the transplant, the donor, or Robert's condition.
* **Heighten the emotional stakes:** Describe Robert's feelings or the anxiety of his family.
* **Use more evocative language:** Employ words and phrases that create a sense of anticipation or unease.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Building Anticipation:** The precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and precision, suggesting a crucial moment.
* **Contrasting Elements:** The juxtaposition of the punctual arrival of the organ with Robert's "critical but stable" condition creates a slight tension. Will the organ arrive in time? Will Robert be strong enough to receive it?
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the nature of Robert's condition or the potential complications. This lack of information leaves room for the reader to imagine the worst.

To increase suspense further:

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his feelings or physical state as he awaits the transplant.
* **Introduce a potential obstacle:** Hint at a problem with the organ, the helicopter, or the medical team.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the tension in the operating room, or Robert's labored breathing.

Here's why:

To increase suspense further:

* **Introduce a ticking clock:** Mention a time limit for the transplant or the viability of the organ.

* **Connect the cleaner to the main plot:** Maybe he overhears a conversation or witnesses something related to Robert's transplant.
