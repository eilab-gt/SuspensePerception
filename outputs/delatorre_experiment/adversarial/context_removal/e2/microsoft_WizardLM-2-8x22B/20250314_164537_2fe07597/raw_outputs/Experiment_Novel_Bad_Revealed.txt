The paragraph sets up a scenario with inherent tension—a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant—which naturally evokes a sense of urgency and concern for the outcome. The specific details, such as the date and the name of the boy, add a touch of realism that can enhance the feeling of suspense. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before introduces an element of relief, potentially reducing the suspense slightly, but the open-ended conclusion of the paragraph— "this is the story of what happened" —leaves the reader with questions and a desire to know more, thus maintaining a level of suspense. However, without more immediate tension or a clear conflict or danger presented in the paragraph itself, the suspense is moderate rather than high.

This paragraph adds to the narrative by describing a critical moment in the transplant process—the arrival of the organ via helicopter. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of precision and urgency. The detail that Robert Bent is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that there is a medical urgency, which can create suspense as readers anticipate the outcome of the situation.

However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the arrival of the helicopter is described as punctual, which might imply that things are going according to plan. The lack of immediate complications or unexpected events in this sentence keeps the suspense level moderate. The reader is aware that a significant event is occurring, but there is no immediate threat or twist presented to elevate the suspense to a higher level.

This paragraph effectively builds suspense through vivid imagery and the introduction of potential obstacles. The description of the men descending from the helicopter with the critical blue case, combined with the urgency implied by the shouting and the need to communicate over the noise of the rotors, creates a tense atmosphere. The specific detail about the temperature of the liver and its importance in being "fully functioning" underscores the high stakes of the situation.

The inaudible shouting and the need for non-verbal communication (touching the colleague's shoulder, pointing at the watch and the doorway) add a layer of uncertainty and the potential for miscommunication, which can heighten suspense. The reader is left to wonder whether the message was correctly understood and whether the team will be able to act in time. The visible nod and the movement towards the exit suggest that the message was received, but the suspense remains high as the reader is kept in anticipation of what might happen next in this time-sensitive scenario.

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could impact the ongoing critical situation with Robert Bent's liver transplant. The detail about the cleaner mopping the service stairwell without placing "wet floor" signs creates a sense of foreboding, as the reader can anticipate that this oversight might lead to an accident or delay, which could have serious consequences given the time-sensitive nature of the organ delivery.

The suspense is built through the mundane description of the cleaner's routine, juxtaposed with the high-stakes situation unfolding elsewhere in the hospital. The reader is aware of the importance of the timing for the liver transplant, and the cleaner's actions set the stage for a possible conflict or complication.

However, the suspense is not at its peak because there is no immediate danger or direct connection established between the cleaner's actions and the transplant team's efforts. The paragraph is more about setting up a scenario that could lead to suspense rather than delivering a heart-stopping moment of tension. The reader is left to speculate on the potential consequences of the wet floors, which maintains a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph maintains a moderate to high level of suspense by introducing a decision point that could have significant consequences. The specific details about the layout of the hospital and the path to the patient create a sense of urgency and anticipation. The reader is aware of the importance of speed in delivering the organ, so the discussion about taking the lift versus the stairs adds tension, especially when the colleague advises against the lift due to time constraints.

The suspense is heightened by the potential for delay, which is a critical factor in a transplant scenario. The reader is left wondering whether the decision to take the stairs will prove to be the quickest route and whether any unforeseen events will occur as they navigate the hospital's interior. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader engaged, concerned about the potential for error or unexpected obstacles that could arise from this choice.

The suspense is not at the maximum level because there is no immediate threat or action taking place; instead, it is the anticipation of what might happen next that sustains the suspense. The reader is kept in a state of uncertainty about whether the organ will reach its destination in time, which is enough to maintain a fairly high level of suspense.

This paragraph significantly raises the level of suspense through an unexpected event that directly threatens the successful delivery of the organ. The suddenness of the man's slip and the immediate physical consequence—twisting his ankle—introduce a sense of danger and urgency. The detail that the case containing the liver rolls down the stairs while the man tries to regain his balance creates a vivid and alarming image, as the reader can infer the potential disaster if the organ were to be damaged or delayed.

The suspense is heightened by the precariousness of the situation; the man is in a vulnerable position, trying to prevent a catastrophe. The reader is likely to be highly engaged at this point, concerned about the outcome of this critical moment. The paragraph effectively conveys the immediacy of the threat and the potential for a negative turn in the story, which are key elements in creating suspense. The reader is left on edge, unsure whether the man will be able to save the organ and whether Robert Bent's transplant will be successful, thus maintaining a high level of suspense.

This paragraph sustains a high level of suspense as it describes the immediate aftermath of the case's fall and the actions taken by the two men to ensure the organ's safety. The detail of the men kneeling down beside the case and exchanging a nod conveys a moment of silent communication and decision-making under pressure, which can be quite tense for the reader.

The instruction to "watch it, in case anyone comes" suggests a need for vigilance and the potential for further complications, adding to the suspense. The swift actions of the man who takes the case and navigates the hospital's "complex network of corridors" keep the reader engaged and concerned about the outcome. The urgency of the situation is underscored by the man's quick pace and the ultimate destination—the transplant department—where the medical team is alerted.

The suspense is not completely at its peak because the paragraph implies that the case has been successfully secured and the organ is presumably still viable, as indicated by the man's ability to continue to the transplant department. However, the reader is likely still anxious about the potential for unforeseen events or delays that could jeopardize the transplant, maintaining a fairly high level of suspense.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by focusing on the emotional and psychological tension experienced by the man left to guard the case. His refusal to move and his superstitious belief that his own suffering is linked to the organ's condition adds a layer of drama and urgency to the scene. The reader is likely to feel the man's anxiety and the weight of the responsibility he carries, which heightens the suspense.

The arrival of the doctors "rushing up the service stairwell" introduces a sense of immediacy and importance, indicating that the situation is critical and time is of the essence. The directive for the man to move away as the doctors take over the scene creates a moment of transition where the reader is left to wonder about the condition of the liver inside the case.

The suspense is strong here because the reader is kept in suspense about whether the organ has been damaged and whether it will be viable for the transplant. The paragraph effectively conveys the gravity of the moment and the potential for a turning point in the story, which are key components of suspenseful storytelling. The reader is left on tenterhooks, waiting for the reveal of the organ's condition, which sustains a high level of suspense.

This paragraph reaches a peak of suspense as it reveals the critical outcome of the organ's fall. The detailed description of the doctor opening the case, combined with the ominous action of pressing the handle with his thumbs, builds anticipation for what is about to be discovered. The silence and the brief look exchanged among those present create a moment of high tension.

The doctor's head shake is a powerful non-verbal cue that something has gone wrong, and the subsequent revelation that the refrigerated case is damaged and leaking air is a devastating blow to the hopes of the characters and the reader. This moment is fraught with consequences, as the viability of the organ is now in serious doubt, and the life-saving transplant is at risk.

The suspense is at its maximum in this paragraph because it presents a significant and potentially story-altering setback. The reader is likely to be deeply invested in the outcome, and the paragraph ends with a sense of impending disaster. The suspense is sustained by the unanswered questions that follow: Will they be able to salvage the situation? Is there a backup plan? What will happen to Robert Bent? The reader is left with a cliffhanger, unsure of how the story will resolve, which is the hallmark of a highly suspenseful narrative moment.

This paragraph sustains a high level of suspense as it describes the critical medical procedures that will determine the fate of the transplant. The detailed account of the liver's transfer to the hepatology laboratory and the initial signs that suggest the organ might still be viable create a sense of cautious optimism, which is quickly overshadowed by the need for a risky biopsy.

The suspense is heightened by the description of the surgeon's preparation and the gravity of the situation. The mention of the surgeon's nervousness and the high stakes involved—a child's life hanging in the balance—add to the tension. The precision required for the biopsy ("if he was one millimetre out") and the potential for irreparable damage introduce a sense of peril and the possibility of human error, which are key elements in creating suspense.

The paragraph effectively conveys the intense pressure of the moment and the delicate nature of the procedure. The reader is likely to be highly engaged, acutely aware of the potential for disaster and deeply concerned about the outcome. The suspense is near its peak because the reader is left in uncertainty about whether the surgeon will succeed in his task without causing harm to the organ, which is essential for the transplant to proceed. The paragraph ends with the surgeon on the verge of performing the biopsy, leaving the reader in suspense about the result and the implications for Robert Bent's future.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense as it details the critical moments following the biopsy. The surgeon's careful insertion of the needle and the relief at not encountering resistance suggest that the procedure is delicate and that the team is acutely aware of the potential for complications. The detailed description of the transparent liquid being drawn into the syringe and then examined under a microscope creates a sense of tension and anticipation.

The surgeon's physical reactions—pursing his lips and blinking—as he analyzes the sample add to the suspense by hinting at his concern and the complexity of interpreting the results. The passage of time is emphasized by the "interminable half a minute," which can feel like an eternity to both the characters and the reader, heightening the sense of urgency.

The paragraph concludes with the surgeon moving away from the microscope and looking at his colleagues "with concern," which is a powerful indicator that the news may not be positive. This moment of silence before the diagnosis is revealed is a classic technique for building suspense, as it leaves the reader hanging on the edge of uncertainty, desperate to know the outcome. The suspense is at a peak because the reader is deeply invested in the result of the biopsy and its implications for Robert Bent's transplant, and the paragraph ends without providing a clear resolution, thus sustaining the tension.
