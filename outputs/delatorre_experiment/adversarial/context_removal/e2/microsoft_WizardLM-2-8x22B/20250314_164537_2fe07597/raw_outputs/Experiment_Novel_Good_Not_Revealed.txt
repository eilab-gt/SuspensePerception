The paragraph sets up a scenario with potential for high suspense—a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The specific details such as the date, the boy's name, and the anticipation of the organ's arrival contribute to a sense of realism and urgency. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph serves as an introduction to a story rather than placing the reader in the midst of a critical moment. The suspensefulness could be heightened by providing more immediate and vivid details, hinting at potential complications, or by showing the stakes from the perspective of the characters involved.

This paragraph introduces a potential element of suspense with the cleaner's routine of mopping the service stairwell and neglecting to place "wet floor" signs. The reader is likely to anticipate a problem related to the wet floors, especially given the high-stakes context of a hospital where a liver transplant is taking place. The mundane nature of the cleaner's job is contrasted with the critical events happening elsewhere in the hospital, which could lead to a critical intersection of these two worlds. However, the suspense is not fully realized in this paragraph alone, as it lacks immediate tension or a direct connection to the unfolding transplant drama. The suspensefulness could be heightened by more explicitly linking the cleaner's actions to potential consequences for the characters involved in the transplant.

This paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution, which naturally reduces the suspense that has been built up throughout the previous paragraphs. Knowing that Robert Bent's transplanted liver is functioning correctly after the tense moments of potential damage is a positive outcome that the reader has been anxiously awaiting. However, the suspensefulness of this paragraph is still relatively high due to the mention of the damage the liver sustained in transit, which keeps the reader engaged up until the moment of confirmation. The specificity of the time (21:26) adds a sense of closure to the event, signaling the end of a long and uncertain process. The suspense is in the final verification, the last hurdle in a series of challenges that could have ended poorly. The reader's investment in the outcome contributes to the paragraph's suspensefulness, despite the overall positive resolution.
