The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear timeline and a sense of anticipation for the outcome of the liver transplant. The fact that the organ was damaged in transit adds an element of uncertainty and tension. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the outcome is revealed at the end of the paragraph, which may reduce the reader's engagement with the story. A more suspenseful approach might have been to withhold the outcome until later in the narrative.
