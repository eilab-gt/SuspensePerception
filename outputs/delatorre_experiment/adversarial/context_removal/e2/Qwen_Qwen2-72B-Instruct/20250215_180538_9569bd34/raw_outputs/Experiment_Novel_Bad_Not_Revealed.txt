The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up an event with high stakes (a liver transplant for a young boy) and mentions that the story is about "what happened," implying that there may have been some unexpected or dramatic events. However, it does not provide any specific details about the events, so the level of suspense is not very high. I would rate it as a 5 on the 9-point scale. 

However, if the paragraph had included more details about the events that occurred during the transplant, or hinted at some kind of danger or uncertainty, the level of suspense would be higher. For example, if the paragraph had mentioned that there were complications during the surgery, or that the organ was damaged during transport, the level of suspense would be higher, and I would rate it closer to a 7 or 8 on the scale.
