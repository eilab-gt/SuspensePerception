I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a liver transplant immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:**  The situation is clearly high-stakes – a child's life depends on the transplant.

**However:**

* **Lack of Conflict:**  There's no immediate sense of danger or conflict. The paragraph focuses on the preparations, which makes it more informative than suspenseful.
* **Predictable Outcome:**  The reader can reasonably assume the transplant will proceed successfully, given the positive setup.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Introduce a potential problem:**  Perhaps there's a delay in the organ arrival, a complication with Robert's health, or a last-minute issue with the donor.
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  Use stronger verbs and language to convey the time pressure and importance of the situation.
* **Hint at a twist:**  Subtly suggest that something unexpected might happen, leaving the reader wondering what's to come.
