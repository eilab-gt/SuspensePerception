I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a liver transplant for an eight-year-old boy establishes a sense of urgency and potential danger.
* **Limited Suspense:** However, the paragraph primarily focuses on setting the scene and providing background information. It lacks immediate conflict or a clear threat to create strong suspense.

The paragraph effectively sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful story, but it doesn't yet deliver the tension and anticipation needed for a higher rating.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Rising Tension:** The precise time adds a sense of urgency and precision, suggesting a race against time.
* **Punctual Arrival:** The helicopter landing "punctually" creates a slight sense of relief, but also highlights the importance of timing.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the nature of Robert's condition or any potential complications, leaving room for worry.

This paragraph builds on the previous one by introducing a concrete element of the story (the organ arrival) and emphasizing the time pressure. However, it still lacks a clear threat or immediate danger to push the suspense higher.

* **Distraction from the Main Plot:** This paragraph feels like a detour from the suspenseful narrative established in the previous paragraphs. It doesn't contribute to the building tension surrounding the liver transplant.

While this paragraph provides some context about the hospital environment, it does little to enhance the suspense of the story. It feels like a lull in the action.
