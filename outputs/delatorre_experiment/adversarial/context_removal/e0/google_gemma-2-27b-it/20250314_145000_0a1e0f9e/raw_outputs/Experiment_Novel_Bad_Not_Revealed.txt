I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity. The mention of a liver transplant adds a layer of seriousness and potential drama.
* **Limited Tension:** While the paragraph establishes a situation with stakes (a child needing a transplant), it lacks immediate conflict or danger. We know the donor has been found, so there's no immediate sense of urgency or doubt about the procedure happening.
* **Promise of More:** The final sentence, "This is the story of what happened,"  leaves the reader wanting to know more, but it doesn't create a strong sense of suspense on its own.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Hint at complications:**  Mention a potential risk or challenge associated with the transplant.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Emphasize the limited time window for the procedure.
* **Focus on Robert's emotional state:** Describe his feelings or fears leading up to the surgery.

Here's why:

* **Punctuality Adds Tension:** The word "punctually" emphasizes the precise timing, creating a sense of anticipation and expectation.
* **Limited Emotional Impact:** While the paragraph conveys the importance of the moment, it lacks emotional depth. We don't get a sense of Robert's condition or the feelings of those involved.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Describe the atmosphere:** Paint a picture of the tense environment in the hospital as everyone awaits the arrival.
* **Focus on a character's perspective:** Show the emotions of a doctor, nurse, or even Robert himself as they track the helicopter's progress.
