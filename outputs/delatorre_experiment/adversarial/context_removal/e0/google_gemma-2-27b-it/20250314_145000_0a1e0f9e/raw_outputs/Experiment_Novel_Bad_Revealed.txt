**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Hint at complications:**  Introduce a subtle suggestion that something might go wrong, like a last-minute delay or a potential medical issue.
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his feelings and thoughts leading up to the transplant, highlighting his vulnerability and the stakes involved.
