The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up an event with high stakes (a liver transplant for a young boy) and mentions that the story is about "what happened," implying that there may be unexpected or dramatic events to follow. However, it does not provide any specific details that would heighten the tension or indicate that the outcome is uncertain. Therefore, I would rate it as a 5 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph has a low to moderate level of suspense. It provides a specific time and event (the helicopter landing with the organ) and mentions that the boy, Robert Bent, is in critical but stable condition, which adds a sense of urgency. However, the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually" suggests that things are proceeding as planned, which may alleviate some of the tension. Therefore, I would rate it as a 3 on the 9-point scale.
