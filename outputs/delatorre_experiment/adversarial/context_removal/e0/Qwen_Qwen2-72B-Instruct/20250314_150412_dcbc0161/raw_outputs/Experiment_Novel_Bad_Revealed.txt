The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up an event with high stakes (a liver transplant for a young boy) and mentions that the story is about "what happened," implying that there may have been some unexpected or dramatic events. However, it does not provide any specific details that would heighten the suspense further. I would rate it a 5 on the 9-point scale. A higher rating would require more details about the potential complications or unexpected events that occurred during the transplant.
