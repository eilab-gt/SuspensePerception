The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up an event with high stakes (a liver transplant for a young boy) and mentions that the story is about "what happened," implying that there may have been some unexpected or dramatic events. However, it does not provide any specific details that would heighten the suspense further. I would rate it a 5 on the 9-point scale. A score of 5 indicates that the paragraph has some suspenseful elements but could be more detailed or dramatic to increase the level of suspense.
