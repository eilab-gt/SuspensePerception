In general, a paragraph's suspensefulness depends on various factors such as the context, the characters' actions and reactions, the use of descriptive language, and the consequences of the events. A suspenseful paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation for the reader, making them want to keep reading to find out what happens next.

Additionally, you could add more consequences to the situation, such as if the boy's life is in danger and the doctors have to make a difficult decision about whether to continue searching for a new organ or not.
