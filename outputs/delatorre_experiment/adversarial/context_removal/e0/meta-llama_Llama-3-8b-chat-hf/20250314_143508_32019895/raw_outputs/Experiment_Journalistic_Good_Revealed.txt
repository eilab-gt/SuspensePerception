I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a factual account of a real event, and the tone is informative and matter-of-fact rather than suspenseful. The use of technical terms like "liver transplant" and "organ" also adds to the sense of detachment. While the paragraph does mention a sense of anticipation and waiting, it does not create a sense of tension or uncertainty that is typical of suspenseful writing. The outcome of the story is also clearly stated, which reduces the suspense even further. Overall, the paragraph is more of a factual report than a suspenseful narrative.
