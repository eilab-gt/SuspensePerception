I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and tension by mentioning the critical condition of Robert Bent and the importance of the organ transplant. The use of precise timing ("08:57") adds to the sense of urgency and creates a sense of expectation. The fact that the helicopter landed "punctually" also implies that everything is going according to plan, which creates a sense of relief, but also raises the stakes and creates a sense of "now or never" urgency. However, the paragraph is still relatively short and lacks a clear sense of danger or uncertainty, which prevents it from being more suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a vivid and intense atmosphere by describing the sounds and movements of the helicopter and the two men. The use of sensory details like the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "hair blown" creates a sense of chaos and urgency. The fact that the men are trying to communicate with each other over the noise of the blades adds to the sense of tension and difficulty. The use of the watch and the pointing gesture creates a sense of urgency and importance, and the nod from the man carrying the case implies that time is of the essence. The fact that the man is moving away from the helicopter towards the exit creates a sense of movement and progression, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The only thing that prevents it from being a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still relatively descriptive and doesn't have a clear sense of danger or uncertainty, but it's getting close!

The fact that they are considering taking the stairs instead of the lift implies that time is of the essence, and the reader is left wondering what might happen if they don't make it to the patient in time. However, the paragraph is still relatively calm and doesn't have a clear sense of danger or uncertainty, which prevents it from being more suspenseful.

The use of phrases like "trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged" and "overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering" creates a sense of psychological tension and raises questions about the man's motivations and fears.

The doctor's request to "Move away, please" creates a sense of anticipation and expectation, as the reader wonders what will happen next.
