I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a vivid and intense atmosphere by describing the scene in detail, including the sound of the rotors and the wind blowing through the men's hair. The use of sensory details like the temperature of the liver and the sound of the blades creates a sense of realism and immediacy. The dialogue is also effective in conveying the sense of urgency and importance of the moment. The fact that the men are trying to communicate over the noise of the blades adds to the tension, and the nod and gesture of the man carrying the case creates a sense of anticipation and expectation. The only thing that keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively slow-burning build-up, and the reader is not yet aware of any major obstacles or complications that might arise.
