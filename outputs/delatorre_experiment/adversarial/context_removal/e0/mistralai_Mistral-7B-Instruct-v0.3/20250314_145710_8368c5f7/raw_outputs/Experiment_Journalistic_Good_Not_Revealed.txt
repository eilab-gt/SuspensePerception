 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

However, the paragraph does not yet reveal any unexpected or dramatic events that would significantly increase the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

However, the suspense is building as the organ is about to be delivered.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping the floor of the service stairwell does not directly relate to the main story and does not create a sense of immediate danger or unexpected events. However, the lack of a "wet floor" sign could potentially create a sense of tension or unease, as it suggests that someone could potentially slip and fall on the wet floor. But it does not significantly increase the suspense of the main story, which is focused on the liver transplant.  The suspense is still building as the liver is about to be transferred to the operating room.  ​
