The paragraph sets up a scenario with inherent tension—a young boy awaiting a life-saving liver transplant—and mentions a potential complication with the organ's transit, which is resolved by the end of the excerpt. The suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the outcome is revealed to be positive before the full story unfolds, which can reduce the sense of uncertainty and danger typically associated with high suspense. However, the mention of the damage sustained by the liver in transit and the specific details about the timing of the events create a sense of urgency and concern for the boy's well-being, contributing to a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph contains elements that contribute to suspense, such as the critical nature of the situation and the precise timing of the helicopter's arrival. The mention of the organ being transported by helicopter suggests urgency and high stakes, which can create a sense of tension. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph is brief and does not delve into any complications or uncertainties that might arise. The punctuality of the helicopter's landing and the description of Robert's condition as "critical but stable" provide some reassurance, which can reduce the level of suspense. Therefore, while there is a degree of suspense due to the importance and time-sensitivity of the event, the paragraph does not maintain a high level of uncertainty or danger to be considered highly suspenseful.

This paragraph introduces a moment of potential tension with the arrival of the men carrying the small blue fridge containing the liver. The specific detail of the fridge's shape and purpose adds to the gravity of the situation, as it is clearly a critical component of the transplant process. However, the suspense is relatively mild because the paragraph does not suggest any immediate threats or complications. The focus on the men carrying the fridge and the mention that the liver is "fully functioning" provides a sense of routine and control, which can mitigate the sense of danger or uncertainty. The suspense here is more about the anticipation of what will happen next rather than an imminent threat, which places it in the lower to middle range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could lead to complications, specifically the absence of a "wet floor" sign after the stairwell has been mopped. The timing, mentioned as "minutes earlier," suggests that the events described are close to intersecting with the critical moments of the liver delivery. However, the suspense is quite subdued because there is no immediate conflict or indication that anyone is about to encounter the wet floor. The paragraph sets up a scenario where a hazard exists, but without a direct connection to the main characters or events, the suspense remains low. It hints at a possible problem without escalating the tension significantly, thus placing it on the lower end of the suspense scale.

This paragraph raises the level of suspense by directly connecting the two men transporting the critical liver with the potential hazard previously introduced—the wet floor in the service stairwell. The decision to use the stairwell, rather than an alternative route, introduces an element of risk and foreshadows a possible accident or complication that could jeopardize the liver transplant. The suspense here is heightened by the reader's awareness of the danger that the characters are unknowingly heading towards. The tension is increased due to the critical nature of the mission and the vulnerability of the organ to any mishap. This scenario is suspenseful because it sets the stage for a potentially adverse event that could have significant consequences, placing it in the middle range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph significantly raises the level of suspense. The moment described is highly tense and critical, as the man carrying the case with the liver slips and the case falls down the stairs. The action is sudden and the consequences are potentially dire, given the importance of the liver for the transplant. The vivid description of the slip and the case plunging down the stairs creates a strong visual image of the accident, which is a key element in building suspense. Readers are likely to be on the edge of their seats, wondering about the condition of the liver and whether it can still be used for the transplant. The suspense is high because the outcome of this accident is uncertain and could have a major impact on the life of Robert Bent and the success of the medical procedure. This paragraph is close to the higher end of the suspense scale.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense, as it follows the immediate aftermath of the accident. The colleague's urgent action to warn the doctors suggests the gravity of the situation and the potential for a critical failure in the transplant process. The detail that the case "was not handled in any way" until the doctors arrived heightens the tension, as it implies that the condition of the liver inside the case is unknown and could be compromised. The suspense here is sustained by the uncertainty surrounding the liver's integrity and the urgency of the response required from the medical team. The reader is left in suspense, waiting to learn the fate of the liver and, by extension, the young boy awaiting the transplant. This paragraph is firmly in the upper range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph, while it continues the narrative and indicates a timely response from the medical team, does not inherently carry a high level of suspense on its own. The prompt arrival of the doctors is a positive development, suggesting that the situation is being addressed quickly, which can actually reduce suspense by providing some reassurance that the problem is being managed. The paragraph lacks details about the condition of the liver or the emotional state of the characters involved, which are elements that could heighten the sense of tension or uncertainty. Therefore, on the suspense scale, this paragraph would rank on the lower side, as it does not significantly escalate the tension or leave the reader with pressing questions about the immediate outcome.

This paragraph introduces a critical and suspenseful moment in the narrative. The opening of the case represents a pivotal point where the fate of the liver—and consequently the young boy's life—is revealed. The discovery that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured raises the stakes dramatically and injects a strong sense of suspense. The reader is left hanging on the outcome, as the rupture could imply that the liver has been damaged or contaminated, which would be disastrous for the transplant procedure. The suspense here is intense because the situation has taken a turn for the worse, and the immediate consequences are unclear. This paragraph is high on the suspense scale, as it presents a significant setback that threatens the successful resolution of the story.

This paragraph sustains a moderate to high level of suspense. The action of taking the case to the hepatic laboratory for a biopsy indicates that the doctors are actively working to assess the condition of the liver, which is a critical detail for the transplant's success. The mention of a biopsy suggests that there is a possibility of damage that needs to be evaluated, and the outcome is uncertain. This uncertainty is a key component of suspense, as readers are left to wonder whether the liver is still viable for transplantation. The paragraph keeps the tension alive by focusing on the medical team's efforts to determine the liver's fate, which directly impacts the life of the young boy. It is a moment of diagnostic suspense, where the reader must wait for the results of the biopsy, placing this paragraph in the upper range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph provides a resolution to the immediate tension by revealing that the liver has withstood the impact and is suitable for transplant. While the suspense builds up to this moment with the uncertainty of the liver's condition, the paragraph itself offers relief and a positive outcome, which naturally reduces the suspense. The reader's concern about whether the liver can be used is addressed, and the narrative takes a turn towards a hopeful resolution. However, there is still some level of suspense remaining, as the actual transplant procedure has not yet been described, and there could be further challenges ahead. The paragraph marks a transition point in the story, where the suspense of the liver's viability is resolved, but other potential sources of tension are still on the horizon, placing it in the middle range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph serves as the resolution to the narrative arc, confirming that Robert Bent's liver transplant was successful and that the organ was not adversely affected by the earlier mishap. The suspense is significantly reduced because the paragraph provides closure to the central tension of the story—the condition of the liver after the fall and the success of the transplant. By stating that the liver is functioning correctly, the paragraph reassures the reader that the critical moment has passed and the outcome is positive. While there is a sense of relief and satisfaction in the resolution, the element of suspense is minimal at this point in the story. Therefore, on the suspense scale, this paragraph would be rated low, as it concludes the tension that was built up throughout the narrative.
