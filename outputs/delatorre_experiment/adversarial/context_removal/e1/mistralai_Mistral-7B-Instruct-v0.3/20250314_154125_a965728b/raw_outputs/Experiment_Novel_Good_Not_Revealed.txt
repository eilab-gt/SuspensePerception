 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell, but it does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story. In fact, it seems to be a distraction from the main story and does not add any tension or anticipation. The paragraph could be removed from the story without affecting the overall narrative.  However, it could be argued that the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell are important details that help to establish the setting and the routine of the hospital, which could be relevant later in the story.  But in terms of suspense, it does not contribute much.
