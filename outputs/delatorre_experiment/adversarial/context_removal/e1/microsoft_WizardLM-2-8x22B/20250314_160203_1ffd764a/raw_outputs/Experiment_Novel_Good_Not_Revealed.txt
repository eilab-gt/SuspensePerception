The paragraph sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful event with the mention of a real event, a young boy awaiting a liver transplant, and the specific details of the date and time. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that it is a retrospective account of an event that has already taken place, and the outcome is not immediately clear. The mention of the donor being found the day before suggests a positive development but does not guarantee a successful outcome, leaving some room for suspense regarding the surgery's result and any potential complications that may arise. The suspensefulness could be heightened with more immediate and vivid details, or by hinting at challenges or uncertainties faced during the wait for the organ or the surgery itself.

This paragraph adds a sense of urgency and critical timing to the narrative, which contributes to its suspensefulness. The specific mention of the time of the helicopter's landing and the condition of Robert Bent as "critical but stable" creates a scenario where the reader is aware that events are reaching a pivotal moment. The precision of the timing suggests that there is little room for error, which can heighten the sense of suspense. However, the paragraph still lacks a direct conflict or complication that would raise the stakes further. The suspense could be intensified by hinting at potential risks or obstacles that could still jeopardize the transplant process, thus keeping the reader on edge about the outcome.

This paragraph significantly increases the suspense by focusing on the immediate and tense actions surrounding the delivery of the liver. The vivid description of the men descending from the helicopter, the emphasis on the blue case containing the organ, and the communication challenges due to the noise of the rotors all contribute to a heightened sense of urgency. The specific detail of the temperature at which the liver must be kept adds to the stakes, implying the delicate nature of the organ's transport. The gestures of the men, the pointing at the watch and the doorway, convey a race against time without explicitly stating it, which effectively builds suspense. The reader is left wondering about the unheard words, the significance of the time, and whether the team will successfully navigate the next steps in the transplant process.

This paragraph introduces a potential element of risk with the cleaner's routine of mopping the service stairwell and not placing "wet floor" signs at the top of each section. The detail about the cleaner's habits and the fact that the stairwell is not heavily trafficked sets up a scenario where an unexpected event could lead to a critical situation, especially in a hospital setting where quick and safe movement is crucial. The suspense arises from the reader's anticipation that someone in a hurry, such as the medical team with the liver case, might use the stairwell and encounter the wet floor, potentially leading to an accident or delay. However, the suspense is somewhat diluted by the mundane and routine nature of the cleaner's work and the lack of immediate tension or time pressure. The reader is aware of the cleaner's actions but not yet how they might impact the urgent situation unfolding elsewhere in the hospital.

This paragraph builds suspense by detailing the path the men must take to deliver the liver to the patient, highlighting the potential for logistical challenges. The specificity of the route—through the service stairwell, past the central archives and storeroom, and the mention of the lift's location—creates a sense of complexity in navigating the hospital. The fact that one man stops the other from taking the lift, suggesting that taking the stairs is quicker, introduces a moment of decision that adds to the tension. The reader is made aware of the urgency of the situation and the need to optimize every second, which is critical in a life-or-death scenario like an organ transplant. The suspense is heightened by the potential for unforeseen delays or complications as they bypass the lift and head directly to the patient's floor on foot.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution and relief, which might initially seem to reduce suspense. However, the fact that the verification of the liver's functionality comes after a series of tense and uncertain events actually reinforces the suspense up until the very moment of confirmation. The specificity of the time (21:26) emphasizes the duration of the suspenseful period and the long wait for a positive outcome. The reader is kept in suspense about whether the liver would function correctly despite the damage it sustained, and the confirmation that it has not been affected by the transit incident brings a satisfying conclusion to the narrative's tension. The suspense is high because the reader is aware of the potential for disaster up until the point where the medical team's verification is given, signaling a successful resolution to the transplant ordeal.
