I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and expectation by mentioning the imminent liver transplant and the waiting for the arrival of the organ. However, it doesn't create a sense of tension or urgency, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which reduces the suspensefulness of the paragraph. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have created more tension by hinting at potential complications or obstacles that might arise during the transplant.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation by describing the scene in vivid detail, using words like "whirlwind", "blown", and "inaudible" to convey the chaos and noise of the helicopter landing.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is a detailed and mundane description of a cleaner's routine, with no hint of tension, danger, or excitement. The use of words like "agreeable" and "whistled" to describe the cleaner's job creates a sense of calm and normalcy, and the fact that the service stairwell is not dirty and doesn't need a thorough clean makes it seem like a completely ordinary and uneventful scene.

Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful at all, and it doesn't create any sense of tension or anticipation. It's a very ordinary and uneventful scene that doesn't grab the reader's attention or make them want to keep reading.
