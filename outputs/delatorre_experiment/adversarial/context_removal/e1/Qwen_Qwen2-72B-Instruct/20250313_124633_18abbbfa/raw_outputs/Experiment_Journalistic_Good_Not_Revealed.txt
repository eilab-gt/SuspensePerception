The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up an event that is about to unfold and involves a high-stakes situation with a young patient awaiting a liver transplant.

The suspense is not at its peak because the outcome is not yet known, but the situation is tense and the reader is likely to be curious about what happens next. However, the paragraph does not contain any immediate danger or conflict, which would increase the level of suspense.
