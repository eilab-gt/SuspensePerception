The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a high-stakes medical procedure and an uncertain outcome. The fact that the patient's situation was critical and that the success of the transplant was in doubt until the very end adds to the tension.

Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

The use of specific details, such as the time of the verification and the fact that the liver was not affected by the damage sustained in transit, creates a sense of resolution and relief.
