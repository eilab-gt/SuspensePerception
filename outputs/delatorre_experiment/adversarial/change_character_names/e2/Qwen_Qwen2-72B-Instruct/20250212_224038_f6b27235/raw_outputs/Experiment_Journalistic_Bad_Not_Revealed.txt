The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear sense of urgency and uncertainty. The mention of a critical situation, the wait for a life-saving organ, and the question of whether the patient will survive all contribute to a sense of tension and anticipation. I would rate it as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The story is clearly building up to a significant event, but it does not yet have the full emotional impact or dramatic tension that would be required for a higher rating. However, it does effectively engage the reader's interest and concern for the outcome.

The use of a specific time ("08:57") adds a sense of immediacy and urgency to the situation. However, the paragraph does not provide enough context or detail to fully engage the reader's emotions or create a sense of dramatic tension. I would rate it as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does create some suspense, but it is not as effective as it could be without more information about the characters, their motivations, and the stakes involved. However, it does effectively convey a sense of urgency and tension in the moment. 

Note: There seems to be a discrepancy in the names used (Morgan in the first paragraph and Alex in the second). Assuming this is an error and the patient's name is consistently Morgan, the second paragraph would still rate similarly in terms of suspense.
