 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The setting in a children's hospital, the critical condition of the young boy, and the impending liver transplant create a sense of urgency and tension. The uncertainty about whether Taylor will survive the wait and the unexpected turn of events with the organ's damage in transit add to the suspense. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Taylor's condition, the medical team's efforts, or the events leading up to the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the suspensefulness scale. While the arrival of the helicopter and the organ is an important event, it does not create a significant sense of tension or uncertainty. The paragraph does not provide any context or background information about Jordan's condition or the transplant, which makes it less suspenseful. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about Jordan's situation, the urgency of the transplant, or the potential consequences of the organ's arrival being delayed. 2. At 08:57, the helicopter carrying the organ landed on the roof of the hospital, but the medical team was nowhere to be found. Jordan's condition was deteriorating rapidly, and every second counted. The medical team had been delayed in traffic, and it was unclear if they would arrive in time to perform the transplant. The tension in the hospital was palpable as the minutes ticked by, and everyone waited anxiously for the medical team to arrive. This version of the paragraph creates a much higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the urgency of the situation and the potential consequences if the medical team is delayed.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension through the use of details such as the low temperature of the liver, the time pressure, and the need for the men to move quickly. The use of sensory details, such as the wind blowing the men's hair and the noise of the helicopter blades, also adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the consequences of the liver not being transplanted in time. 3. Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something frantic, but it was drowned out by the noise of the blades. The man carrying the case gave a panicked look to his colleague, who nodded urgently and motioned for him to follow. They knew that every second counted, and they had to get the liver to the patient as quickly as possible. The tension in the hospital was palpable as they raced down the stairs, weaving through the corridors, and finally bursting into the operating room. The patient was already on the table, unconscious and hooked up to a myriad of machines. The clock was ticking, and the medical team was waiting anxiously for the liver to be delivered. This version of the paragraph creates a much higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the critical condition of the patient and the urgency of the situation. The use of more descriptive language and a clearer sense of the stakes involved also increases the suspense.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the mundane nature of his job, which creates a sense of normalcy and lack of tension. The paragraph does not create any sense of urgency or danger, and the reader is not given any reason to feel concerned about the cleaner or the hospital. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more information about the cleaner's role in the hospital or the events that are about to unfold. 4. Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital’s eight floors. It wasn’t a particularly interesting job. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of color on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. Overall, it was an agreeable job. However, the service stairwell wasn’t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building’s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn’t bother to position the “wet floor” warning signs at the top of each section. That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley, and continued his typical working day. Suddenly, the service stairwell was filled with the sound of sirens and the clatter of running feet. The cleaner froze, his heart pounding in his chest as he realized that something was terribly wrong. The hospital was in lockdown, and he was trapped in the service stairwell with no way out. The tension in the hospital was palpable as the cleaner huddled in the corner, praying for a way out. This version of

 I would rate this paragraph as a 4 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph provides some details about the layout of the hospital and the location of the liver, but it does not create a sense of urgency or tension. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the consequences of the liver not being transplanted in time. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could also describe the men's sense of urgency or the potential obstacles they might face in getting to the patient. 5. The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital's secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom, and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. "The patient is on the 6th floor. It's not worth taking the lift," he said, realizing his colleague's intention. "By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors." His colleague hesitated for a moment, but then nodded and followed his colleague down the service stairwell. Every step they took felt like an eternity, and the weight of the case seemed to grow heavier with each one. The tension in the hospital was palpable as they raced down the stairs, their hearts pounding in their chests. They knew that every second counted, and they had to get the liver to the patient as quickly as possible. This version of the paragraph creates a much higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the critical condition of the patient and the urgency of the situation. The use of more descriptive language and a clearer sense of the stakes involved also increases the suspense.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and danger through the description of the man slipping and almost falling, and the potential damage to the liver in the case. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the case spinning and the men holding their breath, also adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the consequences of the liver being damaged. 6. His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised, he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror as the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. The tension in the hospital was palpable as they raced down the stairs, their hearts pounding in their chests. The patient was on the 6th floor, and every second counted. They knew that if the liver was damaged, it would be useless for the transplant. This version of the paragraph creates a much higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the critical nature of the liver and the potential consequences of it being damaged. The use of more descriptive language and a clearer sense of the stakes involved also increases the suspense.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and uncertainty as the men are unsure if the liver has been damaged. The use of dialogue between the men adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering if the liver is still usable. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the consequences of the liver not being transplanted in time. 7. Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. The tension in the hospital was palpable as the man raced through the corridors, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew that every second counted, and he had to get the liver to the medical team as quickly as possible. The patient was critical, and the transplant was the only hope for his survival. This version of the paragraph creates a much higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the critical condition of the patient and the urgency of the situation. The use of more descriptive language and a clearer sense of the stakes involved also increases the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation as the reader waits to find out if the liver has been damaged. The use of the man's superstition adds an element of mystery and intrigue, but it does not significantly increase the suspense. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the consequences of the liver not being transplanted in time. 8. Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. “Move away, please,” asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. The tension in the hospital was palpable as the doctors worked quickly to assess the condition of the liver. The patient was critical, and every second counted. The man watched anxiously as the doctors opened the case and examined the liver, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew that if the liver was damaged, it would be a disaster for the patient. This version of the paragraph creates a much higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the critical condition of the patient and the urgency of the situation. The use of more descriptive language and a clearer sense of the stakes involved also increases the suspense.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and disappointment as the reader learns that the liver has been damaged. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the case opening and the description of the refrigerated air escaping, adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the consequences of the liver not being transplanted in time. 9. He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The tension in the hospital was palpable as the doctors exchanged worried glances. The patient was critical, and the transplant was the only hope for his survival. The man watched anxiously as the doctors discussed their options, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew that if the liver was damaged, it would be a disaster for the patient.

   I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph creates a high level of tension and suspense as the reader is aware of the critical condition of the patient and the importance of the biopsy. The use of sensory details, such as the surgeon's nervousness and the description of the small syringe, adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency, as the reader knows that the biopsy results will determine the patient's fate. This paragraph is very effective in building suspense, as it provides a clear sense of the stakes involved and the potential consequences of failure. The use of descriptive language and the focus on the surgeon's emotions also adds to the suspense. 10. According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies before, but never before had a child’s life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. The tension in the laboratory was palpable as the surgeon took a deep breath and prepared to make the incision. The patient was critical, and the transplant was the only hope for his survival. The man who had brought the liver up from the service stairwell watched anxiously from a distance, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew that if the biopsy was unsuccessful, it would be a disaster for the patient. This version of the paragraph creates an even higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the critical condition of the patient and the urgency of the situation.

   I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph creates a high level of tension and suspense as the reader waits for the results of the biopsy. The use of sensory details, such as the surgeon's relief at not encountering resistance and the description of his anxious colleagues, adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency, as the reader knows that the biopsy results will determine the patient's fate. The use of descriptive language and the focus on the surgeon's emotions also adds to the suspense. The paragraph is very effective in building suspense, as it provides a clear sense of the stakes involved and the potential consequences of failure. The use of the word "interminable" to describe the half a minute the surgeon spends analyzing the sample also adds to the suspense. 11. Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact. The tension in the laboratory was palpable as the surgeon delivered the news to the medical team. The patient was critical, and the transplant was no longer an option. The man who had brought the liver up from the service stairwell watched in horror as the medical team exchanged worried glances. He knew that the liver was no longer usable, and the patient would likely die without a transplant. This version of the paragraph creates an even higher level of suspense, as the reader is now aware of the critical condition of the patient and the devastating consequences of the biops

   I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. While the paragraph provides a clear resolution to the story, it does not create a sense of tension or suspense. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the patient's condition or the consequences of the liver not being transplanted in time. 12. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Jordan, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. The man who had brought the liver up from the service stairwell felt a wave of despair wash over him. He had failed in his mission, and Jordan was gone. The patient's family was waiting in the waiting room, unaware of the events that had transpired. The man knew that he had let them down, and he couldn't bear the thought of having to tell them that their son was dead. This version of the paragraph creates a sense of tragedy and regret, but it does not significantly increase the suspense. 13.
