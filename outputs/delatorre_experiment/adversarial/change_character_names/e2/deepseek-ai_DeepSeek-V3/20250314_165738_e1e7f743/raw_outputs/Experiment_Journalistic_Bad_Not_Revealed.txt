I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The mention of uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait creates tension. The specific details (date, location, hospital) add a sense of realism, which can heighten suspense.
  
- **Areas for improvement**: While the stakes are clear, the paragraph doesn't delve deeply into the emotional or immediate tension of the moment. It feels more like an introduction to a story rather than a moment of heightened suspense. Adding more sensory details or a sense of urgency could increase the suspensefulness.

Overall, it’s a solid setup for suspense but could be more gripping with additional tension-building elements.

I would rate this paragraph an **8** for suspensefulness. Here's why:
