This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a pivotal moment in the story—the arrival of the helicopter with the life-saving organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of urgency and precision that is often associated with high-stakes situations. The detail that Morgan is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the situation is still precarious, maintaining the tension. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the organ has arrived, which is a positive development in the narrative. The reader is likely to feel relief that the organ is there but is still left in suspense regarding the outcome of the transplant and Morgan's fate.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the intense and precise process of transferring the life-saving organ from the helicopter to the hospital. The imagery of the men descending from the helicopter with the blue case, the noise of the rotors, and the communication through gestures due to the deafening sound all contribute to a palpable sense of urgency. The specific detail of the liver being stored at four degrees centigrade to maintain its viability adds to the realism and critical nature of the situation. The mention that the patient is in a critical condition and that there is no time to lose heightens the tension, leaving the reader anxious about the success of the operation and the patient's survival.

This paragraph contains elements that contribute to a mild level of suspense. The mundane routine of the cleaner is contrasted with the high-stakes situation of the liver transplant, which the reader is already aware of from the previous context. The detail about the cleaner not placing "wet floor" signs could potentially foreshadow an accident or complication, which adds a layer of tension. The reader might anticipate that the wet floors could pose a risk to the urgent transport of the organ or the medical team. However, the suspense is not as immediate or intense as in the previous paragraphs because the cleaner's actions are not directly linked to the critical medical event, and there is no direct threat or imminent danger presented in this paragraph. The suspense here is more subtle and speculative, based on the reader's anticipation of potential problems that could arise from the seemingly trivial oversight.

This paragraph builds suspense by detailing the path the men must take to deliver the organ, highlighting the potential for obstacles and delays. The specificity of the route—through the service stairwell, past the central archives and storeroom, and the mention of the doctors' rooms and the east wing lift—creates a vivid picture of the environment and the journey ahead. The decision to use the stairs instead of waiting for the lift introduces a sense of urgency and the potential for physical exertion or mishap as they navigate the stairs with the precious cargo. The reader is aware of the critical nature of the task and the potential consequences if something were to go wrong, which is heightened by the detail that the patient is on the 6th floor, emphasizing the distance they need to cover quickly. The suspense is maintained by the focus on the logistics of the delivery and the inherent risks of navigating a complex environment under time pressure.

The imagery of the case rolling down the stairs, with its precious and delicate contents at risk, creates a sense of dread and urgency. The simile comparing the sound of the case to "a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag" not only conveys the chaos of the moment but also emphasizes the fragility of the organ inside. The men's reaction, holding their breath in horror, mirrors the reader's own tension and concern for the outcome. The suspense is heightened by the anticipation of the potential consequences of this accident for the young patient awaiting the transplant.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. It describes the critical and delicate procedure being performed to assess the viability of the liver after the case's fall.

The suspense reaches its peak as the surgeon finally moves away from the microscope to deliver the diagnosis.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution and relief, which naturally reduces the suspense level compared to the preceding paragraphs. However, the suspensefulness is still significant because the paragraph confirms the successful outcome of a high-stakes situation. The specificity of the time (21:26) and the verification that Jordan's newly transplanted liver is functioning correctly despite the earlier damage in transit, offers closure to the narrative arc. The reader experiences a release of tension upon learning that the transplant was successful, but the suspense is retained through the mention of the potential impact of the damage sustained during transport. The paragraph serves as the denouement of the suspenseful sequence of events, reassuring the reader that the young patient's life is no longer in immediate danger, while also acknowledging the earlier peril.
