However, the paragraph lacks:

* **Immediate danger:** The suspense is more about anticipation than imminent threat.
* **Strong emotional hooks:** We don't yet connect deeply with Morgan or the medical team.
* **A clear cliffhanger:** The ending feels more like a setup than a suspenseful hook.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:
