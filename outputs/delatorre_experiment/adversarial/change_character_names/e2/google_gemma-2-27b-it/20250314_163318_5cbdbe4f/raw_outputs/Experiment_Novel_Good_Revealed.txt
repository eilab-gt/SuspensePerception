I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

However, the paragraph lacks:

* **Immediate danger:** The suspense is more about anticipation than imminent threat.
* **Strong emotional hooks:** We don't yet connect deeply with Morgan or the medical team.
* **A clear cliffhanger:** The ending feels more like a setup than a suspenseful hook.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on Morgan's deteriorating condition:** Show the physical and emotional toll of his wait.
* **Highlight the team's anxiety:**  Describe their doubts and fears about the transplant's success.
* **End on a more uncertain note:**  Instead of stating the transplant was successful, leave the reader wondering if Morgan will pull through.
