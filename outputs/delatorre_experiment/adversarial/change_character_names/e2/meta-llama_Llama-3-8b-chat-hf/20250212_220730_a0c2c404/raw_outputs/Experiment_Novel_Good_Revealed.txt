I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the urgency of the situation and the uncertainty of the outcome.

Overall, the paragraph is engaging and interesting, but it could be more suspenseful with more dramatic tension and a clearer sense of danger.
