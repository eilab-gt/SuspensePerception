  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a clear and compelling scenario, with a sense of urgency and danger: a young boy is in critical condition and needs a liver transplant immediately, but the team is unsure if he will survive the wait. The use of specific details, such as the date and time of the event, and the fact that a suitable donor has been found, adds to the sense of realism and heightens the tension.

However, the paragraph does not provide any concrete information about what will happen next, which keeps the reader in suspense. The use of phrases like "this is the story of what happened" and "but they were not sure if Alex would survive the wait" creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind, which is what makes the paragraph suspenseful.

Overall, while the paragraph does provide some information, it leaves many questions unanswered, which keeps the reader engaged and curious to find out what will happen next.
