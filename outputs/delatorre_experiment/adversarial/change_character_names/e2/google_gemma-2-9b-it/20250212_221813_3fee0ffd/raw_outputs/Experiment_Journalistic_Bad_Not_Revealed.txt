I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:**  The situation is clearly life-or-death, with Morgan's critical condition and the urgency of the transplant.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of the time (8 a.m.) and the wait for the organ creates a sense of anticipation and urgency.
* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph ends with a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering what will happen to Morgan.

**What's Missing:**

* **Emotional Connection:** While we know Morgan is in danger, we don't feel his fear or the team's anxiety.
* **Hints of Conflict:**  There's no indication of any obstacles or complications that might arise.


To make the paragraph more suspenseful, you could:

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying Morgan's situation is critical, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical team.
* **Build tension:**  Add details about the challenges of finding a donor or the potential risks of the surgery.
* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps there's a last-minute complication or a disagreement among the doctors.
