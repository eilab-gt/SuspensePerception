I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a clear resolution to the suspense built up in the previous paragraphs. We learn that the transplant was successful, removing the central tension of the story.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very brief and lacks the vivid descriptions, emotional depth, and sensory details that contribute to suspense.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The statement "the medical team verified" is a passive way of conveying the information. It doesn't show us the team's reactions, the patient's condition, or the relief they feel.

To increase the suspense, you could:

* **Delay the resolution:**  Instead of stating the outcome outright, hint at it through the team's actions or observations.
* **Focus on the patient's perspective:** Describe Morgan's experience during the critical moments after the transplant.
* **Introduce a last-minute complication:**  Just as the team believes everything is going well, something unexpected happens that threatens the success of the transplant.



As it stands, the paragraph provides a satisfying conclusion but lacks the suspenseful elements that would make it truly gripping.
