I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by stating it's a true story. The setting (children's hospital) and the stakes (liver transplant) create a sense of urgency and potential danger.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph highlights the critical nature of the situation ("Alex's situation was critical") and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome ("they were not sure if Alex would survive the wait").
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a clear, immediate threat presented in this paragraph. We know something is at risk, but we don't know what that "something" is or how it might unfold.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a specific obstacle:**  Perhaps there's a complication with the donor organ, a sudden change in Alex's condition, or a logistical problem delaying the transplant.
* **Heighten the emotional stakes:**  Give us more insight into Alex's feelings or the emotional toll on his family and the medical team.
* **End with a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a question or a sense of impending danger.
