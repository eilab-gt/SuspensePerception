I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of the time (8 a.m.) and the wait for the organ creates a sense of anticipation and urgency.
* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph ends with a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.

**What's missing to make it even more suspenseful:**

* **Sensory Details:**  Adding details about Alex's condition, the hospital atmosphere, or the emotions of the medical team would heighten the tension.
* **Internal Conflict:**  Exploring Alex's thoughts and fears, or the doubts and anxieties of the medical team, would add another layer of suspense.
