I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by setting the scene for a potentially life-or-death situation, introducing a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the medical team's certification of Alex's death, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more intense.

However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it had more dramatic language or a clearer sense of the stakes. For example, the phrase "his situation was critical" is somewhat vague, and the paragraph could benefit from more vivid descriptions of the medical team's emotions and the atmosphere of the hospital. Additionally, the paragraph's tone is somewhat matter-of-fact, which may detract from the sense of suspense. Overall, while the paragraph is engaging, it could be even more effective with more attention to language and tone.
