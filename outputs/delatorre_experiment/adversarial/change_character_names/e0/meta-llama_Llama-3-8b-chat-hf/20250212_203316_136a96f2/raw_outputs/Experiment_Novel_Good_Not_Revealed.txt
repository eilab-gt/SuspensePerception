I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the medical team and Morgan's family waiting for the arrival of a liver transplant. The mention of Morgan's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense.

The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which also reduces the suspenseful effect.
