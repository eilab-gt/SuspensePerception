 I would rate the paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included more details about the patient's condition, the urgency of the transplant, or the challenges of transporting the organ. Additionally, the use of a more dramatic tone and more descriptive language could have helped to create a greater sense of anticipation and tension.
