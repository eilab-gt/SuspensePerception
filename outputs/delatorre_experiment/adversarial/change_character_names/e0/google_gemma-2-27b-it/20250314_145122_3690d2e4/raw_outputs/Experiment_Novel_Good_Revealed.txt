I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes stakes:** We know Morgan is critically ill and needs the transplant to survive. This creates some tension.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The wait for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential problems:** The mention of the liver being damaged in transit raises the possibility of complications.

However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:** We learn the transplant was successful right at the end. This removes much of the suspense.
* **The language is relatively straightforward:** There's not much use of vivid imagery or sensory details to heighten the tension.


To make it more suspenseful, you could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader guessing about Morgan's fate until later in the story.
* **Focus on Morgan's experience:** Describe his feelings and thoughts during the wait.
* **Use more evocative language:** Create a more immersive and tense atmosphere.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **It introduces a key event:** The arrival of the organ is a crucial moment in the story.
* **It uses precise timing:** The specific time (08:57) adds a sense of immediacy.

However:

* **It lacks tension:** The sentence is very straightforward and factual. There's no sense of danger or uncertainty.
* **It doesn't reveal any obstacles:** We don't know if there are any complications with the organ or the transplant process.

To make it more suspenseful, you could:

* **Describe the atmosphere:** What's the mood like in the hospital? Are people anxious? Hopeful?
* **Focus on Riley's condition:** How is he doing? Is he getting worse?
* **Hint at potential problems:** Is there anything that could go wrong with the transplant?

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Sense of urgency:** The helicopter arrival, the shouted words lost in the noise, and the emphasis on time create a feeling of urgency and pressure.
* **Focus on the precious cargo:** The description of the liver being stored at a specific temperature highlights its importance and fragility.
* **Non-verbal communication:** The men's gestures and nods add to the tension, suggesting a need for secrecy and speed.

However:

* **Limited emotional engagement:** We don't get a strong sense of the men's feelings or the stakes involved for them personally.

To increase suspense:

* **Introduce an obstacle:** Perhaps there's a problem with the elevator, or someone tries to interfere with the transport.
* **Heighten the emotional stakes:** Show the men's anxiety or determination.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the whirring of the blades, the cold air, the smell of antiseptic.

Here's why:

* **Mundane details:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of his cleaning process are not inherently suspenseful.
* **Lack of conflict or threat:** There's no sense of danger or impending disaster.
* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("the floor... had been mopped") creates a detached and uneventful tone.

However:

* **Lack of immediate threat:** While there's a sense of urgency, there's no clear and present danger.

To increase suspense:

* **Introduce an obstacle:** Perhaps they encounter someone unexpected on the stairs, or the lights flicker ominously.
