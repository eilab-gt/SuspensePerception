The paragraph has a high level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a tragic outcome. The fact that the story is based on a true event adds to the tension, as does the description of the medical team's efforts to save the boy's life. The uncertainty about whether the boy would survive the wait for the transplant also creates a sense of suspense. Overall, I would rate the paragraph as an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The only reason it is not a 9 is that the outcome is revealed at the end of the paragraph, which can lessen the suspense for some readers. However, the tragic nature of the story and the fact that it is based on a real event still make it a very suspenseful read.
