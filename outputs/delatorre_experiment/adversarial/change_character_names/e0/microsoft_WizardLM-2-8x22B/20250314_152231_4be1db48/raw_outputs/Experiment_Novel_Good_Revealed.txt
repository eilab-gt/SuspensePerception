The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene with a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the donor organ's arrival and the uncertainty of whether the boy, Morgan, will survive the wait introduces a sense of urgency and tension. The specific details, such as the time of the verification of the liver's function, add to the suspense by highlighting the precision and high stakes of the situation. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph concludes with the information that the liver was functioning correctly, which resolves the immediate tension and hints at a positive outcome. The suspensefulness could be heightened further if the paragraph ended before revealing the status of the transplant, leaving the reader with more unanswered questions.

This paragraph introduces a moment of high tension with the punctual landing of a helicopter carrying a vital organ for a patient in critical condition. The specificity of the time and the mention of the patient's delicate but stable state create a sense of urgency and anticipation. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph only describes the moment of the helicopter's arrival and does not delve into potential complications or the patient's immediate future. The suspense could be heightened by hinting at risks or uncertainties that might still lie ahead, such as the condition of the organ upon arrival or the patient's readiness for the transplant.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine job at the hospital, focusing on the mundane aspects of his work and the environment in which he operates. While there is an attempt to build atmosphere with descriptions of the stairwell and the cleaner's preferences, there is no immediate tension or impending danger presented that would typically contribute to suspense. The mention of the lack of "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but without a direct connection to a critical event or a sense of urgency, the suspense remains low. The paragraph is more descriptive and character-focused rather than suspense-driven.

This paragraph provides a resolution to the suspense built up in previous paragraphs. It confirms that the transplanted liver is functioning correctly and was not damaged during transit, which addresses the central concern of the narrative. While the word "finally" and the specific time given contribute to a sense of relief and closure, the suspensefulness of this paragraph on its own is relatively low because it concludes the critical event with a positive outcome. The tension has been resolved, and the reader's questions about the immediate success of the transplant have been answered. However, the paragraph does not address any potential long-term complications or the patient's overall recovery, which could have maintained a degree of suspense if they had been left unresolved.
