  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The paragraph sets up a clear and compelling situation: a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. This creates a strong sense of urgency and raises the stakes for the reader.
2. The use of time constraints (since 8 a.m.) adds to the sense of urgency and raises questions about what might happen if the organ doesn't arrive in time.
3. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before adds to the tension, as it suggests that the outcome is far from certain.
4. The phrase "This is the story of what happened" at the end of the paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and raises the question of what will happen to Morgan.

However, there are a few things that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite straightforward and doesn't use any particularly suspenseful language or techniques.
2. The situation is described in a relatively matter-of-fact way, which doesn't create a sense of unease or uncertainty in the reader.
3. The paragraph doesn't provide any clues about what might happen to Morgan, which means that the reader is left with a sense of uncertainty rather than a sense of anticipation.

Overall, while the paragraph is suspenseful, it could be made more suspenseful by using more descriptive language, creating more tension and uncertainty, and providing more clues about what might happen to the characters.
