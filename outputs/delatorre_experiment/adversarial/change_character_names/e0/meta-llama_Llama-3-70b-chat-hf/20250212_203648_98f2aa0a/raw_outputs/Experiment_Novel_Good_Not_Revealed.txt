I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts with a hook that grabs the reader's attention: "What you are about to read is the story of a real event..." This creates a sense of intrigue and makes the reader curious.
* The setup of the story is clear and concise, establishing the setting, characters, and situation.
* The introduction of the critical situation and the uncertainty of Morgan's survival creates tension and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Morgan survive?" or "What will happen to him?"
* However, the paragraph is still quite straightforward and lacks a sense of urgency or immediate danger. The situation is critical, but it's not like Morgan is in imminent danger of dying in the next few minutes.
* The paragraph also ends with a somewhat calming phrase, "This is the story of what happened," which takes some of the edge off the suspense.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of setting up the story and creating some tension, but it could be more suspenseful with more dramatic language, a greater sense of urgency, or a cliffhanger ending.

I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is quite straightforward and lacks any real sense of tension or suspense. The helicopter lands "punctually", which implies that everything is going according to plan, and Morgan is in a "critical but stable" condition, which suggests that he's not in immediate danger.
* There's no sense of urgency or surprise in the paragraph. The helicopter arrives on time, and everything seems to be proceeding as expected.
* The paragraph doesn't raise any new questions or create any sense of uncertainty. It simply provides a update on the situation, but doesn't add any new layers of tension or suspense.
* The language is also quite bland and doesn't create any sense of drama or excitement. The use of words like "punctually" and "critical but stable" creates a sense of routine and normalcy, rather than suspense or tension.

Overall, this paragraph is more of a transition or a setup for the next part of the story, rather than a suspenseful moment in itself. It's a necessary part of the narrative, but it doesn't create any real sense of tension or suspense.

* The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension from the start, with the description of the rotors still turning and the men descending from the helicopter in a hurry.

* The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively straightforward description of events. There's no real twist or surprise, and the outcome is still somewhat predictable.

* The only potential element of suspense is the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to put up "wet floor" warning signs, but this is presented as a minor detail and not as a source of tension or danger.

Overall, this paragraph is more of a character study or a descriptive passage than a suspenseful moment in the story. It's a calm and peaceful interlude that doesn't create any sense of tension or anxiety in the reader.

* The fact that one of the men stays behind to watch the case, "in case anyone comes", adds a sense of vigilance and raises the question of what might happen if someone else arrives on the scene.
* The description of the man's journey down to the transplant department is relatively straightforward and lacks the sense of urgency and danger that was present in the previous paragraph. The use of phrases like "without wasting any time" and "walked quickly" tries to create a sense of haste, but it's not as effective as the more intense language used earlier.
* Overall, while the paragraph still has some suspenseful elements, it's more focused on the aftermath of the accident and the men's attempts to respond to it, rather than creating a sense of immediate danger or tension.
