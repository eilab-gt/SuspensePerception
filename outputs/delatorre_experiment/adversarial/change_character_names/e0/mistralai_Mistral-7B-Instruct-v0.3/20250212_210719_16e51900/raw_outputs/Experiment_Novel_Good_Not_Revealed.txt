 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty about Morgan's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the challenges or obstacles that might arise during the transplant or Morgan's recovery.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of anticipation with the arrival of the helicopter, but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could describe the tension in the hospital as they wait for the helicopter to land, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the organ transfer.  For example, "At 08:57, the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital, but the medical team knew that the race against time was far from over."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension with the description of the men rushing to get the liver to Morgan, and the use of details such as the temperature of the case and the watch on the wrist add to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of danger with the mention of the spinning blades and the need for the men to duck down. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the challenges or obstacles that the men might face during the transfer of the liver, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if they don't make it in time.  For example, "Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible. Realizing that he hadn’t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. Every second counted, and if they didn't make it in time, Morgan's life could be in jeopardy."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell, but it does not create a sense of suspense or tension. In fact, the paragraph seems to be a distraction from the main story and does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to provide more information about the cleaner's role in the story or how the cleaner's routine might intersect with the main events of the story. For example, "Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the service stairwell, unaware that it would soon become the scene of a dramatic race against time as a team of doctors and nurses rushed to save a young patient's life."  This would create a sense of foreshadowing and add to the overall suspense of the story.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency and tension with the description of the man carrying the liver needing to get to the patient quickly, and the use of details such as the service stairwell and the location of the patient on the 6th floor add to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of danger with the mention of the need to avoid the lift and the use of the phrase "it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors." However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the challenges or obstacles that the men might face during their journey to the 6th floor, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if they don't make it in time.  For example, "The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital’s secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor. It’s not worth taking the lift,” he said, realising his colleague’s intention. “By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it’ll have taken longer than walking down two floors. But we have to be careful, the 6th floor is where the infectious diseases ward is located, and we don’t want to risk contaminating the liver.” This would create a sense of danger and add to the overall suspense of the story.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the description of the man slipping on the stairs and the case rolling down, and the use of details such as the noise of the case spinning adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of danger with the mention of the man's twisted ankle and the potential for the case to be damaged. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the case being damaged or lost, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if the liver is not delivered in time.  For example, "His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. The liver inside the case was delicate and needed to be kept at a specific temperature, and if it was damaged or exposed to the wrong temperature, it could be rendered useless." This would create a sense of urgency and add to the overall suspense of the story.  Additionally, the paragraph could be rewritten to create a more dramatic and suspenseful tone, such as "His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle and sending a jolt of pain through his body. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs, each clatter echoing through the service stairwell like a death knell. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. The liver inside the case was delicate and needed to be kept at a specific temperature, and if it was damaged or exposed to the wrong

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the description of the men's concern for the case and the need to call the doctors, and the use of details such as the man's quick pace adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the need to reach the transplant department quickly. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the case being damaged or lost, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if the liver is not delivered in time.  For example, "Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other with a mixture of relief and dread. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors. If the liver is damaged, it could be too late for Morgan.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes. If the liver is not delivered in time, Morgan’s life could be in jeopardy.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors, his heart pounding in his chest as he raced against the clock to reach the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. Every second counted, and if he didn't make it in time, Morgan’s life could be in jeopardy." This would create a sense of urgency and add to the overall suspense of the story.  Additionally, the paragraph could be rewritten to create a more dramatic and suspenseful tone, such as "Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped, the two men's hearts pounding in their chests as they knelt down beside it, their eyes locked on the precious cargo. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the description of the man's superstition and his willingness to bear the pain in exchange for the liver's condition, and the use of details such as the doctors rushing up the service stairwell adds to the suspense. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the case being damaged or lost, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if the liver is not delivered in time.  For example, "Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell, their footsteps echoing through the narrow stairwell like a drumbeat. Every second counted, and if the liver was not delivered in time, Morgan’s life could be in jeopardy. He clenched his teeth, gritting them against the pain as he waited for the doctors to arrive, his eyes fixed on the case, willing it to remain intact." This would create a sense of urgency and add to the overall suspense of the story.  Additionally, the paragraph could be rewritten to create a more dramatic and suspenseful tone, such as "Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the description of the doctor opening the case and the mention of the fridge rupturing, and the use of details such as the slow escape of refrigerated air adds to the suspense. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the case being damaged or lost, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if the liver is not delivered in time.  For example, "He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look, the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The liver inside the case was delicate and needed to be kept at a specific temperature, and if it was exposed to the wrong temperature, it could be rendered useless. Every second counted, and if the liver was not delivered in time, Morgan’s life could be in jeopardy." This would create a sense of urgency and add to the overall suspense of the story.  Additionally, the paragraph could be rewritten to create a more dramatic and suspenseful tone, such as "He heard a click as the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs, the case splitting open like a wound.

The liver inside the case was delicate and needed to be kept at a specific temperature, and if it was exposed to the wrong temperature, it could be rendered useless. Every second counted, and if the liver was not delivered in time, Morgan’s life could be in jeopardy. The doctor's expression was grave as he closed the case, his eyes fixed on the slow escape of the refrigerated air, his mind racing with thoughts of the consequences if the liver was damaged."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the description of the surgeon's nervousness and the mention of the importance of the biopsy, and the use of details such as the small syringe and the mention of the child's life hanging in the balance adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the need to check the metabolic rate quickly. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the biopsy going wrong, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if the liver is not delivered in time.  For example, "According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child’s life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably, and if the liver was not delivered in time, Morgan’s life could be in jeopardy. Every second counted, and if the biopsy went wrong, there would be no second chances." This would create a sense of urgency and add to the overall suspense of the story.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the description of the surgeon's anxious anticipation and the mention of the microscope, and the use of details such as the transparent liquid and the mention of the metabolic rate adds to the suspense. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the biopsy going wrong, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if the liver is not delivered in time.  For example, "Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube, his heart pounding in his chest as he analysed the sample, his mind racing with thoughts of the consequences if the liver was damaged. Every second counted, and if the biopsy went wrong, there would be no second chances. The metabolic rate gave cause for optimism: the organ had not been damaged by the impact, but the surgeon knew that the real test would come when the liver was transplanted into Morgan's body. If the liver was rejected, Morgan's life could be in jeopardy." This would create a sense of urgency and add to the overall suspense of the story.  Additionally, the paragraph could be rewritten to create a more dramatic and suspenseful tone, such as "Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution, but it does not create a sense of tension or suspense. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the liver not functioning correctly, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise if the liver is not delivered in time.  For example, "Finally, at 21:26, the medical team verified that Jordan's newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly, but with a sigh of relief, they knew that the battle was not yet won. The liver had sustained damage in transit, and if it failed to function properly, Jordan's life could still be in jeopardy. The medical team knew that they would have to closely monitor the liver's function and be prepared for any complications that might arise." This would create a sense of relief, but also a sense of ongoing tension and suspense.  Additionally, the paragraph could be rewritten to create a more dramatic and suspenseful tone, such as "Finally, at 21:26, the medical team held their breath as they verified that Jordan's newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly. But their relief was short-lived, as they knew that the battle was far from over. The liver had sustained damage in transit, and if it failed to function properly, Jordan's life could still be in jeopardy. The medical team knew that they would have to closely monitor the liver's function and be prepared for any complications that might arise, every second counting as they worked to save Jordan's life." This would create a more dramatic and suspenseful tone and emphasize the ongoing challenges that the medical team faced.
