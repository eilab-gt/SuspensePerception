The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the challenges or obstacles that might arise during the transplant or Morgan's recovery.

Additionally, it could provide more context about Alex's condition and the urgency of the situation.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the mention of the "small blue fridge" containing a "fully functioning liver," which suggests the importance of the organ and the high stakes involved in its delivery. However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the men, such as their roles or their expressions, or it could hint at potential complications that might arise during the transplant. Additionally, it could provide more context about the urgency of the situation and the impact of the transplant on the patient's life.  Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be more so with additional details and context.  ​

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to provide more information about the hospital environment or the medical team's preparations for the transplant.  Overall, the paragraph is not suspenseful and detracts from the overall suspense of the story.  ​
