* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the tension ("they were not sure if Riley would survive the wait") rather than showing it through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on Morgan's perspective:**  Describe his fear, hope, or pain.
