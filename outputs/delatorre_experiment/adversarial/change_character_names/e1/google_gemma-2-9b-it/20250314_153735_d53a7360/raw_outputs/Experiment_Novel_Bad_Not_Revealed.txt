I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by stating it's a true story. The setting (children's hospital) and the stakes (liver transplant) create a sense of urgency and potential danger.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph highlights the critical nature of the situation ("Alex's situation was critical") and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome ("they were not sure if Alex would survive the wait").
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a clear, immediate threat presented in this paragraph. We know something is at risk, but we don't know what that "something" is or how it might unfold.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a specific obstacle:**  Perhaps there's a complication with the donor organ, a sudden change in Alex's condition, or a logistical problem delaying the transplant.
* **Heighten the emotional stakes:**  Give us more insight into Alex's feelings or the emotional toll on his family and the medical team.
* **End with a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a question or a sense of impending danger.

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The specific time ("08:57") and the mention of a helicopter landing create a sense of urgency and impending action.
* **Juxtaposition:** The contrast between the punctuality of the helicopter arrival and Jordan's critical but stable condition creates a slight tension.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful nature of the cleaner's job. There's no immediate threat, conflict, or mystery.
* **Lack of Tension:** The language is descriptive but lacks any elements that would create a sense of anticipation or worry.
* **Predictable Plot:** The entire paragraph follows a predictable pattern: the cleaner cleans, he finishes, he goes back down, and he continues his day.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce an anomaly:**  Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, notices a strange sound, or encounters a person who shouldn't be there.
* **Hint at a hidden danger:**  Mention a recent incident in the hospital, a security breach, or a rumor about something sinister happening in the stairwell.
* **Shift the perspective:**  Tell the story from the point of view of someone else in the hospital who is aware of a potential threat and is watching the cleaner.



This paragraph is more of a slice-of-life description than a suspenseful narrative. To make it more engaging, you'd need to introduce elements that create uncertainty, danger, or intrigue.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a risk:** Perhaps the service stairwell is poorly lit, has a creaky sound that might alert someone, or there's a chance of encountering someone unexpected.
