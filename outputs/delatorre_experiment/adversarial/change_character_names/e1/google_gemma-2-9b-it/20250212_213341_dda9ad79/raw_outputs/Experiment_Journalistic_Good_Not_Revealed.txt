I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Image:** The description of the "small blue fridge" as a case containing a "fully functioning liver" is unusual and creates a sense of mystery.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for Danger:** The mention of a wet floor and the missing "wet floor" sign suggests a potential hazard.
* **Foreshadowing:**  The timing, just minutes before the arrival of the liver, hints at a possible connection to the organ's transport.

* **Introduce a character:**  Describe someone approaching the stairwell, unaware of the danger.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Connect the wet floor to the liver transport in a more direct way.
* **Add sensory details:**  Describe the sound of footsteps, the slippery feel of the floor, or the tension in the air.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for Conflict:**  The choice to use the service stairwell, especially after the previous paragraph's hint about a wet floor, introduces a potential obstacle.
