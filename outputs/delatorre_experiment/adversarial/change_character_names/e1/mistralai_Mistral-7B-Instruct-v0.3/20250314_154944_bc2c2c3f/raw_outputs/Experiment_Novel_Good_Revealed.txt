 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The narrative sets up a tense situation with the critical condition of the young boy, Morgan, and the imminent liver transplant. The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait adds to the suspense. The mention of a suitable donor and the arrival of the organ creates anticipation, and the final confirmation that the liver is functioning correctly provides a satisfying resolution, but leaves room for further developments or complications.
