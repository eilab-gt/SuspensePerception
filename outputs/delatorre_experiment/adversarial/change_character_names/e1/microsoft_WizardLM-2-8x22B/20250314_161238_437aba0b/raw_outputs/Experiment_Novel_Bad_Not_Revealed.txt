This paragraph builds on the suspense established in the previous context by introducing a time-sensitive event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ. The specific mention of the time (08:57) and the description of the condition of the patient, Jordan, as "critical but stable" adds to the tension. The reader is likely to feel a sense of urgency and relief that the organ has arrived on time, yet the suspense is maintained because the outcome of the transplant and Jordan's fate are still unknown. The precision of the details and the critical nature of the situation contribute to a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph heightens the suspense significantly. The vivid description of the men descending from the helicopter with the critical organ in a blue case, the urgency conveyed by their actions, and the communication difficulties due to the noise of the helicopter all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The specific detail of the liver being stored at four degrees centigrade to keep it functional underscores the precision required in the situation. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the reminder that there is no time to lose adds a race-against-the-clock element to the narrative. The reader is likely to be fully engaged, wondering if the team will successfully transport the liver in time to save the patient's life, which makes this paragraph very suspenseful.

This paragraph introduces a seemingly mundane activity—a cleaner performing his daily routine—which creates a contrast with the high-stakes medical drama previously described. The suspense in this paragraph is more subtle and atmospheric. While the cleaner's actions are ordinary, the detail about not placing "wet floor" signs could potentially foreshadow an accident or complication, especially given the urgency of the situation with the liver transplant. The reader might anticipate a possible collision of events, with the cleaner's oversight impacting the critical mission underway. The contrast between the cleaner's peaceful routine and the potential for disaster creates a mild sense of suspense, but it is not as immediate or intense as the previous paragraphs, hence the lower rating on the suspense scale.
