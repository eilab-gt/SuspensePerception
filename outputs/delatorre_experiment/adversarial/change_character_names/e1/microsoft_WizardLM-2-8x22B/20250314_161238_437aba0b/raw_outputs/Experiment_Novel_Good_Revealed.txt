This paragraph contains elements that contribute to a sense of suspense, but it is not as intense as the previous examples. The mundane routine of the cleaner is contrasted with the high-stakes medical drama occurring elsewhere in the hospital, creating a sense of foreboding. The detail about the absence of "wet floor" signs introduces a potential hazard that could have consequences for the urgent delivery of the organ. The reader is aware that the cleaner's actions, or lack thereof, could inadvertently impact the critical situation. However, the suspense is somewhat diluted by the focus on the cleaner's routine and the lack of immediate danger or time pressure. The paragraph sets up a scenario where the cleaner's oversight could lead to a critical event, but the suspense is more subtle and anticipatory rather than acute.
