This paragraph builds on the suspense established in the previous context by introducing a time-sensitive event: the arrival of the helicopter carrying the life-saving organ.

The reader is aware that the success of the transplant hinges on the condition of the liver upon arrival. While the suspense is not as heightened as in the previous paragraphs, as there is no immediate threat or time pressure described here, the careful handling of the organ and the potential for something to go wrong maintain a moderate level of suspense. The reader is likely curious and concerned about the condition of the liver and whether it will be viable for the transplant, keeping them engaged in the narrative.

This paragraph introduces a new element of potential risk that could impact the ongoing critical situation. The fact that the cleaner has finished mopping just minutes before the arrival of the men carrying the liver creates a sense of foreboding. The absence of a "wet floor" sign adds an element of danger that could lead to an accident or delay, potentially jeopardizing the transplant process. The reader is likely to feel a sense of tension, anticipating the possibility of a slip or fall that could have serious consequences. While this scenario does not directly involve the main characters of the story, it adds a layer of suspense by presenting an unforeseen hazard that could indirectly affect the outcome of the central event. The timing and the lack of warning sign create a moderate level of suspense, as the reader wonders if and how this oversight might play a role in the unfolding story.

This paragraph introduces a potential risk without explicitly stating an imminent threat, which creates a mild level of suspense. The reader is aware of the hazardous condition of the service stairwell from the previous paragraph and is likely to feel concern for the safety of the two men carrying the liver. The decision of the men to use the stairwell where the floor has just been mopped sets the stage for potential danger. However, because the paragraph does not describe any immediate consequences or accidents, the suspense is more about the anticipation of what could happen rather than a direct confrontation with danger. The reader is left in a state of mild tension, waiting to see if the men will safely navigate the stairwell or if the lack of a "wet floor" sign will lead to an incident that could affect the transplant operation.
