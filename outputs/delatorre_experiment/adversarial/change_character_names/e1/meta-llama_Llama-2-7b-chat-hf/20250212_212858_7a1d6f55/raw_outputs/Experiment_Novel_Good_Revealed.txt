  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The paragraph starts with a hook by introducing a real event that took place at a well-known hospital, which creates curiosity and intrigue.
2. The time frame of the event is established, creating a sense of urgency and tension.
3. The medical team's uncertainty about Morgan's survival adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering if he will make it through the wait.
4. The mention of the organ being transported and the risk of damage during transit adds to the tension and suspense.
5. The use of specific times (8 a.m. and 21:26) adds to the sense of urgency and creates a sense of anticipation as the reader waits for the outcome.

However, there are a few elements that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite straightforward and doesn't have any unexpected twists or turns that would really heighten the suspense.
2. The outcome of the event is already known, as the paragraph is retelling a real event that took place. This takes away some of the suspense, as the reader already knows how it ends.

Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be even more effective with some additional elements of surprise or uncertainty to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
