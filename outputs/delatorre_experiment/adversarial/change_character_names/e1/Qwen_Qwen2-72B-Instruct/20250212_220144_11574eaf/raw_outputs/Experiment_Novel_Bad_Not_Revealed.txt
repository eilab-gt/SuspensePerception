The paragraph has a high level of suspense, but it is more of a resolution of the suspense that has been building throughout the story rather than creating new suspense. The use of the specific time and the finality of the situation creates a sense of closure, but also a sense of tragedy and loss. The mention of the death of the patient and the inability to carry out the transplant adds to the emotional impact of the story.
