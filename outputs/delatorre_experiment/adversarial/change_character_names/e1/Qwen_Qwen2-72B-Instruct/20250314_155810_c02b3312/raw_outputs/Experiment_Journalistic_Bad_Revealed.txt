The paragraph has a high level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a tragic outcome. The fact that the story is based on a true event adds to the tension, as does the description of the medical team's efforts to save the boy's life. The uncertainty about whether the organ would arrive in time and the ultimate failure to save the boy's life create a sense of dramatic tension that keeps the reader engaged. I would rate this paragraph as an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The only reason it is not a 9 is that the outcome is revealed at the end of the paragraph, which can lessen the suspense for some readers. However, the details of what happened and how the tragedy unfolded are still likely to keep readers engaged and interested in learning more.

However, the paragraph does not provide enough information to create a high level of suspense, as it does not describe any immediate obstacles or challenges that the medical team must overcome. I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. It is not a particularly suspenseful paragraph on its own, but it does contribute to the overall tension of the story.
