The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear sense of urgency and uncertainty.

The story is clearly building up to a significant event, but it does not yet have the full emotional impact or dramatic tension that would be required for a higher rating. However, it does effectively engage the reader's interest and concern for the outcome.
