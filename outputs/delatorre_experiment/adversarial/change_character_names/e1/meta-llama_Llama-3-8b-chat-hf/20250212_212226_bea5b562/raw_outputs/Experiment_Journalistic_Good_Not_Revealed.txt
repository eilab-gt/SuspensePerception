I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, as the medical team is waiting for a liver transplant and Alex's condition is precarious. The use of phrases like "imminent liver transplant", "awaiting the arrival of the organ", and "not sure if Alex would survive the wait" creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the transplant arrive on time?", "Will Alex survive?", and "What will happen if the transplant is delayed?". However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of surprise or unexpected twists, which would elevate it to a higher level of suspensefulness.

The only thing that keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively straightforward and predictable sequence of events, and the reader is not left with many unanswered questions or loose ends.
