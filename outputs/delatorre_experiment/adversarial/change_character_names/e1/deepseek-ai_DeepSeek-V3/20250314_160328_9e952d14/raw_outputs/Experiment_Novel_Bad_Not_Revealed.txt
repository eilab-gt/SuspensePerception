I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant.

- **Areas for improvement**: While the stakes are clear, the paragraph doesn't delve deeply into the emotional or physical urgency of the situation. It also doesn't introduce any immediate obstacles or unexpected twists, which could elevate the suspense further. The tone is more informative than gripping.

Overall, it’s a solid setup for suspense but could be more intense with additional details or a more urgent narrative style.
