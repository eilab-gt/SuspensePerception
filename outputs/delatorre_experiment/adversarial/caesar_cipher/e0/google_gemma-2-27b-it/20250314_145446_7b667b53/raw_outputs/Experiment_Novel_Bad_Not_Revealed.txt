I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intrigue:** The mention of an encrypted message and a mysterious event immediately piques curiosity.
* **Setting:** The reference to a specific date, location, and event (XFVI Ehqlrii Fkloguhq’s Krvslwdo) adds a layer of realism and potential danger.
* **Mystery:** The details about the death of Urehuw Ehqw and the ongoing investigation create a sense of intrigue and unanswered questions.
* **Limited Information:** The paragraph withholds crucial information, like the nature of the event and Urehuw Ehqw's involvement, leaving the reader wanting more.

**However:**

* **Cipher Reveal:** The initial statement about the Caesar cipher somewhat diminishes the suspense. Knowing the encryption method makes it feel less mysterious.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While there's a sense of intrigue, there's no immediate danger or ticking clock to heighten the tension.


Overall, the paragraph effectively sets up a suspenseful scenario but could benefit from further development to increase the sense of urgency and danger.
