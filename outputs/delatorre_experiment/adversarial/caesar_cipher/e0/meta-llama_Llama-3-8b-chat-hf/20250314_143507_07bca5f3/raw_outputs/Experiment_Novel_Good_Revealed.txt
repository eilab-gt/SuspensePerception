I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a common trope in suspenseful stories. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 adds a sense of mystery and intrigue. However, the paragraph quickly becomes more technical and focused on the details of the encryption, which may lose some readers who are not familiar with cryptography.

The paragraph does build some suspense by hinting at the importance of the message and the fact that it has been encrypted. The mention of a "vwrub" (which appears to be a code or a hidden message) and the fact that it has been "udg" (which could mean "decoded" or "unlocked") adds to the sense of mystery. However, the paragraph does not have a clear plot or characters, which may make it harder to sustain a sense of suspense throughout.

Overall, while the paragraph has some suspenseful elements, it may not be enough to keep readers engaged for an extended period of time.
