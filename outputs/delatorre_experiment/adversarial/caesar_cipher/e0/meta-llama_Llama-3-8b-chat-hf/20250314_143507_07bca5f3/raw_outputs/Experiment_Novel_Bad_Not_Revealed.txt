I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a classic suspense-building technique. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue.

The paragraph then goes on to describe a series of events that are cryptic and unclear, which adds to the suspense. The mention of a "hidden message" and the fact that someone is trying to decipher it creates a sense of tension and anticipation.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it had more specific details and a clearer sense of danger or urgency. The text is quite vague and doesn't provide much information about what's at stake or what the consequences of not deciphering the message might be. Additionally, the writing style is quite formal and lacks a sense of urgency or excitement, which could make the text feel more suspenseful.

Overall, while the paragraph is suspenseful, it could be more effective with more specific details and a clearer sense of danger or urgency.
