I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a classic suspense-building technique. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 adds to the sense of mystery. However, the paragraph quickly becomes more technical and focused on the details of the encryption, which reduces the suspense.

The paragraph does contain some suspenseful elements, such as the mention of a hidden message and the suggestion that someone may be trying to uncover it. The use of phrases like "wkhb zhuh qrz dzdlwlqj wkh duulydo ri wkh rujdq" (which roughly translates to "they were trying to uncover the truth about the message") adds to the sense of intrigue.

However, the paragraph is ultimately more focused on explaining the encryption technique than on building suspense. The use of technical terms and the detailed explanation of the cipher reduces the sense of tension and uncertainty that is typical of suspenseful writing. Overall, while the paragraph has some suspenseful elements, it is not particularly effective at building suspense.
