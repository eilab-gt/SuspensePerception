I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a classic suspense-building technique. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 adds to the sense of mystery. However, the paragraph quickly becomes more technical and focused on the details of the encryption, which reduces the suspense.

The paragraph does contain some suspenseful elements, such as the mention of a hidden message and the suggestion that someone is trying to uncover it. The use of phrases like "wkhb zhuh qrz dzdlwlqj wkh duulydo ri wkh rujdq" (which roughly translates to "they were trying to uncover the truth about the message") adds to the sense of intrigue.

However, the paragraph is ultimately more focused on explaining the encryption technique than on building suspense, which prevents it from reaching a higher level of suspensefulness.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a classic suspense-building technique. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3.2 adds to the sense of mystery.

The paragraph then takes a more ominous turn with the mention of a "kholfrswhu fduublqj wkh rujdq" (which roughly translates to "a hidden truth about the message"), and the suggestion that someone (Urehuw Ehqw) has been searching for it in a "fulwlfdo exw vwdeoh frqglwlrq" (which roughly translates to "a hidden and obscure place"). This creates a sense of intrigue and raises questions about what this hidden truth might be and why it's so important.

The only thing that prevents this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still quite cryptic and doesn't provide much concrete information to grab the reader's attention. However, the use of suspenseful language and the hint of a hidden truth makes it a compelling and suspenseful read.
