I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a classic suspense-building technique. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue.

The paragraph then goes on to describe a series of events that are cryptic and unclear, which adds to the suspense. The use of phrases like "wkhb zhuh qrz dzdlwlqj wkh duulydo ri wkh rujdq" and "wklv lv wkh vwrub ri zkdw kdsshqhg" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty.

However, the paragraph is not extremely suspenseful because it is written in a somewhat formal and technical style, which can make it harder to follow and less engaging. Additionally, the text does not provide much context or background information, which can make it difficult to understand what is happening and why it is important.

Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be more effective if it were written in a more engaging and accessible style.
