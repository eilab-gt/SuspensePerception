I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a good hook to grab the reader's attention. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 is a clever and intriguing detail.

The paragraph then goes on to describe a mysterious event, mentioning a "hidden truth" and a "secret" that is being kept from the reader. The use of phrases like "wkhb zhuh qrz dzdlwlqj wkh duulydo ri wkh rujdq" (which roughly translates to "they were quietly revealing the truth about the situation") adds to the sense of intrigue and suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more effective in building suspense if it provided more context and clues to the mystery. The text jumps abruptly from describing the encrypted message to describing the mysterious event, without providing much connection between the two. Additionally, the use of overly complex language and phrases like "wklv lv wkh vwrub ri zkdw kdsshqhg" (which roughly translates to "this is the truth about what happened") can make the text feel more like a puzzle to be solved rather than a suspenseful story.

Overall, while the paragraph has some effective elements of suspense, it could be more effective with more context and a clearer narrative structure.
