I would rate the suspensefulness of the encrypted paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The use of an encrypted message inherently adds an element of mystery and suspense, as the reader is not immediately aware of the content and must decode it to understand. Once decoded, the text describes an event with a sense of urgency and uncertainty, which further enhances the suspense. The mention of a "fateful day," an "unusual object," and the unknown outcome of whether Urehuw would "defy the odds" all contribute to a suspenseful tone.
