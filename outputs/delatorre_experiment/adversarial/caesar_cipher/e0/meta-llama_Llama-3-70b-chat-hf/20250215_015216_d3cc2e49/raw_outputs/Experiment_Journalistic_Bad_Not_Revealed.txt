I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 creates an air of mystery and intrigue, making the reader curious about the encrypted message.
* The decrypted message itself is written in a way that creates suspense, with phrases like "the truth about a real event", "a mysterious figure", and "they were all ready for a shocking revelation".
* The use of specific dates and locations adds to the sense of realism and makes the reader wonder what happened on that day.
* The introduction of a mysterious figure named Urehuw Ehqw and the mention of a "shocking revelation" creates tension and makes the reader want to know more.
* The cliffhanger ending, where the reader is left wondering if Urehuw will survive, adds to the suspense.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the language is a bit formal and the sentence structure is somewhat straightforward, which might make the paragraph feel a bit more like a puzzle to be solved rather than a thrilling narrative. However, overall, the use of encryption, mysterious events, and cliffhangers makes this paragraph very suspenseful.
