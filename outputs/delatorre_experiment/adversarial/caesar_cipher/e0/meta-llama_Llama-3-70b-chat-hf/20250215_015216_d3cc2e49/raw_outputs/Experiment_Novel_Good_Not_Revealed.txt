I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 creates an air of mystery and intrigue, making the reader curious about the encrypted message.
* The decrypted message itself is written in a way that creates suspense, with phrases like "the truth about a real event", "a mysterious figure", and "they were all ready for a shocking revelation".
* The use of specific details like dates, times, and locations adds to the sense of realism and makes the reader feel like they're reading about a real event.
* The cliffhanger ending, where the reader is left wondering what happened next, adds to the suspense.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the language is a bit formal and dry, which might detract from the suspenseful atmosphere. Additionally, the use of a cipher might be more intriguing for readers who are familiar with cryptography, but might be confusing or off-putting for others. Overall, however, the paragraph does a great job of creating a sense of suspense and intrigue.

The paragraph feels more like a setup or a teaser, rather than a fully fleshed-out suspenseful scene. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could benefit from more descriptive language, a clearer sense of stakes, and a more dramatic or intense situation.
