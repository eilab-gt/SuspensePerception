 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on a 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The use of an encrypted language adds an element of mystery, but the context provided (a Caesar cipher with a step of 3) reduces some of the suspense. The mention of a countdown and the potential for a revelation at the end increases the suspense slightly, but the overall tone remains more informative than suspenseful.
