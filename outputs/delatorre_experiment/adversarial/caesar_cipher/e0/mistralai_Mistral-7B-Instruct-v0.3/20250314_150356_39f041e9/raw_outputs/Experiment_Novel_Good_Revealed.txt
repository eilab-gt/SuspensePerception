 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on a 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The use of a Caesar cipher and the mention of encryption might suggest a mystery or secret, but the content itself does not provide enough context or intrigue to significantly heighten the suspense. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if it were part of a larger narrative or if it contained more clues or hints about the nature of the encrypted message.
