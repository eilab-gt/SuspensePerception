I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intrigue:** The mention of an encrypted message and a mysterious event immediately piques curiosity.
* **Setting:** The reference to a specific date, location, and event (XFVI Ehqlrii Fkloguhqâ€™s Krvslwdo) adds a layer of realism and potential danger.
* **Mystery:** The description of a death and an ongoing investigation creates a sense of suspense and raises questions about what happened.
* **Unanswered Questions:** The paragraph ends with a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering about the nature of the encryption, the identity of the victim, and the outcome of the investigation.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While there's a sense of mystery, there's no immediate threat or danger to a specific character that would heighten the suspense significantly.
* **Cipher Information:**  Revealing the cipher type and step might lessen the suspense for readers familiar with cryptography, as they might feel they can easily decode the message.


Overall, the paragraph effectively sets up a suspenseful scenario, but it could be made even more gripping by introducing a more immediate threat or withholding information about the cipher.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:
