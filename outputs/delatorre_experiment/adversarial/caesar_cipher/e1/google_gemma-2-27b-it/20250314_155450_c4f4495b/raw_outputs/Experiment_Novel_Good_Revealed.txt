I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Context is Key:** While the encrypted message adds a layer of mystery, it lacks context for the reader. Without knowing who Urehuw Ehqw is or the nature of the situation, the suspense is limited.
* **Limited Information:** The paragraph only provides a brief snapshot of a moment in time. It doesn't offer enough information to truly hook the reader and make them invested in the outcome.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the clock was ticking") can weaken the suspense by distancing the reader from the action.

**What could be improved:**

* **Provide Context:** Give the reader some background information about the characters and the situation. Who is Urehuw Ehqw? What is at stake?
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating that the situation is "tense," use descriptive language to show the reader the tension through the characters' actions, thoughts, and surroundings.
* **Active Voice:** Use active voice to make the writing more dynamic and engaging.

By adding more context, detail, and active voice, this paragraph could be made much more suspenseful.
