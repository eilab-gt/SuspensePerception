I would rate the suspensefulness of the encrypted paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The use of an encrypted message inherently adds an element of mystery and intrigue, as the reader is not immediately privy to the content and must decode it to understand. The decoded message reveals a narrative that hints at a significant event, a mysterious individual named Urehuw Ehqw, and an uncertain outcome, which all contribute to building suspense. The anticipation of what happened at the event and whether Urehuw would fulfill his role adds to the tension.
