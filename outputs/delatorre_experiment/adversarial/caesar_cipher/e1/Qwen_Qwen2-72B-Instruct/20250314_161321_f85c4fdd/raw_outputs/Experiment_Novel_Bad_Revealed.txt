On a 9-point scale for suspensefulness, I would rate the encrypted paragraph as an 8. The use of an encrypted message immediately adds an element of mystery and intrigue, as the reader is not immediately privy to the content. Once decrypted, the text reveals a narrative that builds suspense through its description of an event that took place at a specific location and time, involving a character named Urehuw Ehqw and a failed attempt to unveil a mysterious object. The uncertainty surrounding the outcome and the cliffhanger ending contribute to the overall suspense. However, the full impact of the suspense is dependent on the reader's ability to decrypt the message, which may limit the initial suspense for those unfamiliar with the Caesar cipher.
