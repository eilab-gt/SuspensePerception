I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a Caesar cipher immediately piques curiosity.  
* **Cryptic Message:** The encrypted message itself is designed to be mysterious and difficult to decipher, adding to the suspense.
* **Hints of a Story:**  The mention of names, locations, and a specific date suggests a narrative unfolding, but the details are fragmented and unclear.
* **Questions Raised:** The paragraph ends with a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering about Urehuw Ehqw's fate and the true nature of the situation.

**What's Missing:**

* **Emotional Hook:** While the situation is intriguing, there isn't a strong emotional connection to the characters or their predicament.
* **Pacing:** The paragraph feels a bit dense and could benefit from a slower pace to build tension more effectively.
* **Sensory Details:**  Adding more sensory details (sight, sound, smell, etc.) could create a more immersive and suspenseful experience.


Overall, the paragraph has a good foundation for suspense, but it could be enhanced with more emotional depth, pacing, and sensory details.
