I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a good hook to grab the reader's attention. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 is a clever and intriguing detail.

The paragraph then goes on to describe a mysterious event, with phrases like "wrrn sodfh dw wkh XFVI Ehqlrii Fkloguhq’v Krvslwdo" and "wkh hqwluh phglfdo whdp wuhdwlqj klp zhuh doo uhdgb iru klv lpplqhqw olyhu wudqvsodqw" that create a sense of mystery and intrigue.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it built up the tension and anticipation more effectively. The use of phrases like "mxvw wkh gdb ehiruh d vxlwdeoh grqru kdg ehhq irxqg" and "wklv lv wkh vwrub ri zkdw kdsshqhg" feels a bit abrupt and doesn't quite create the sense of urgency and danger that would make the reader feel like they're on the edge of their seat.

Overall, the paragraph is engaging and intriguing, but could benefit from a bit more build-up and tension to make it truly suspenseful.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is a bit short and doesn't build up the tension and anticipation as much as it could. The language is still quite cryptic and mysterious, but it could benefit from a bit more development to make the reader feel like they're on the edge of their seat.
