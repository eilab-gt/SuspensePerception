I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a good hook to grab the reader's attention. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 is a clever and intriguing detail.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it built up the tension and anticipation more effectively. The story feels a bit disjointed and lacks a clear sense of urgency or danger.

Overall, the paragraph is engaging and has some suspenseful elements, but it could be more effective with more careful pacing and attention to building tension.
