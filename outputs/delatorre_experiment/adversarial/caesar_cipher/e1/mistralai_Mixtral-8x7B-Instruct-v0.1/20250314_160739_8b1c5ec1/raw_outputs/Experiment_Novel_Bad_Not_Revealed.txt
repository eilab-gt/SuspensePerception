 I would rate the paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The mention of the text being encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a step of 3.1 might pique some curiosity, but the rest of the paragraph does not contain any suspenseful or intriguing content. The use of technical terms and the lack of context or clear purpose in the decryption of the text does not contribute to a sense of suspense.
