I would rate the suspensefulness of this paragraph at **7 out of 9**. Here's why:

Additionally, the encryption adds a layer of confusion rather than suspense, as the reader must decode the text first. 

Overall, it’s quite suspenseful but could be more gripping with a more immersive narrative style.
