I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 creates an air of mystery and intrigue, making the reader curious about the encrypted message.
* The decrypted message itself is written in a way that creates suspense, with phrases like "the truth about a real event", "a mysterious figure", and "they were all ready for a shocking revelation".
* The use of specific dates and times adds to the sense of urgency and importance, making the reader feel like they're reading about a real event.
* The description of the characters' actions and emotions, such as "they were all ready", "they were now waiting", and "they were not sure", creates a sense of tension and anticipation.
* The final sentence, "This is the truth about what happened", is particularly effective in creating suspense, as it implies that the reader is about to uncover a shocking or surprising revelation.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the language and tone are somewhat formal and matter-of-fact, which might detract slightly from the overall sense of suspense. However, the use of the cipher and the carefully crafted language make this paragraph very effective at creating suspense.
