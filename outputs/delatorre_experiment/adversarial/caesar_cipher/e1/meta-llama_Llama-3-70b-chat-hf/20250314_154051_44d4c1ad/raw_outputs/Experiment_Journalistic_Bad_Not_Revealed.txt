I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 creates an air of mystery and intrigue, making the reader curious about the encrypted message.
* The decrypted message itself is written in a way that creates suspense, with phrases like "the truth about a real event", "a mysterious figure", and "they were all ready for a shocking revelation".
* The use of specific dates and times adds a sense of urgency and importance to the events being described.
* The description of the characters' actions and emotions, such as "they were all ready", "they were now waiting", and "they were not sure", creates a sense of tension and anticipation.
* The final sentence, "This is the truth about what happened", is particularly effective in creating suspense, as it implies that the events being described are significant and potentially shocking.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the language and tone are somewhat formal and matter-of-fact, which may detract slightly from the overall sense of suspense. However, the use of the cipher and the carefully crafted language make this paragraph very effective at creating suspense.
