 I would rate this paragraph a 3 on a 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The use of a Caesar cipher and the mention of encrypted text can create a sense of mystery, but the actual content of the text is not particularly engaging or intriguing, and the numerical values do not add to the suspense. To increase the suspense, the text could be more cryptic, include more clues or hints, or build up to a more dramatic or unexpected revelation.
