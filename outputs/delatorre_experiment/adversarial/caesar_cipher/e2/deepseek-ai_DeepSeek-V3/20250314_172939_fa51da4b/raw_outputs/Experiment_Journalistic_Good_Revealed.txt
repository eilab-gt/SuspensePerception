4. **Structure and Pacing**: The pacing is steady, but it doesn't escalate dramatically. The suspense is more about the outcome of a medical procedure rather than a life-or-death struggle.

Overall, it’s moderately suspenseful but could be more gripping with additional emotional depth or higher stakes.
