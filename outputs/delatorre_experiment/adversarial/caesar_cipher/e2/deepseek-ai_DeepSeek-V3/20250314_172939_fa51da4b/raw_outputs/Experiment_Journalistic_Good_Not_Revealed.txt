I would rate the suspensefulness of this paragraph at **7 out of 9**. Here's why:

1. **High Stakes**: The paragraph involves a life-or-death situation—a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. This immediately creates tension and emotional investment.
2. **Uncertainty**: The text explicitly mentions that the medical team wasn’t sure if Robert would survive the wait, adding a layer of suspense.
3. **Timing**: The mention of the transplant happening just after a suitable donor was found heightens the urgency and keeps the reader engaged.

However, the suspense is slightly diminished because the paragraph is written in a factual, retrospective tone rather than in the moment. Additionally, the Caesar cipher encryption might distract some readers from the content itself, reducing the emotional impact. 

Overall, it’s quite suspenseful but could be even more gripping with a more immediate, narrative-driven style.
