 I would rate the paragraph a 2 for suspensefulness. The information about the Caesar cipher and the encrypted text might be interesting to someone who is familiar with cryptography, but the paragraph does not contain any elements that create a sense of suspense or anticipation for the reader. The focus on technical details and the lack of context or story make it difficult for the reader to become invested in the text or to feel a sense of tension or curiosity.
