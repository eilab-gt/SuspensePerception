I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** The opening sentence about a Caesar cipher immediately piques curiosity. It suggests a hidden message and a mystery to be solved.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The paragraph describes a real event with a specific date and time, creating a sense of immediacy and importance.
* **Vague Details:** The use of phrases like "a shocking event" and "the nature of the incident" leaves the reader wanting to know more.
* **Suspenseful Ending:** The final sentence, stating "This is the story of what happened," leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, eager to learn the details of the event.

**However:**

* **Lack of Personal Connection:** The paragraph doesn't establish a strong emotional connection with any characters, which could limit the suspense for some readers.
* **Overly Descriptive:** Some sentences are quite dense with information, which might slow down the pace and reduce the overall tension.


Overall, the paragraph effectively sets up a mystery and creates a sense of anticipation, but it could be even more suspenseful with a stronger emotional hook and a tighter narrative focus.
