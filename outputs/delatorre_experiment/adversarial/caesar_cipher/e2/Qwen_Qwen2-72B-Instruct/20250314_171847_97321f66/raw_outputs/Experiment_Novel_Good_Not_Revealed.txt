I would rate the suspensefulness of the encrypted paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The use of an encrypted message inherently adds an element of mystery and suspense as the reader is not immediately able to understand the content. The decrypted text reveals a narrative that hints at a significant event, a mysterious individual named Urehuw Ehqw, and an uncertain outcome, which all contribute to building suspense. The anticipation of what happened at the event and whether Urehuw would fulfill his role adds to the overall suspense of the paragraph.

I would rate the suspensefulness of the encrypted paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The use of encryption immediately adds an element of intrigue and mystery, as the reader cannot understand the content without decryption. Once decrypted, the text reveals a scenario involving a "rujdq" (which could be a type of event or situation) and a character named Urehuw Ehqw, who is in a real but uncertain condition. The mention of Urehuw's state being "fulwlfdo" (physical) but "vwdeoh" (vague) creates a sense of uncertainty and tension, which contributes to the suspense. However, the paragraph is quite short and does not provide enough context or detail to build a high level of suspense, hence the rating of 6.
