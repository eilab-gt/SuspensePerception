I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a classic suspense-building technique. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue.

The paragraph then goes on to describe a series of events that are cryptic and unclear, which adds to the suspense. The use of phrases like "wkhb zhuh qrz dzdlwlqj wkh duulydo ri wkh rujdq" and "wklv lv wkh vwrub ri zkdw kdsshqhg" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty.

However, the paragraph is not extremely suspenseful because it is written in a somewhat formal and technical tone, which can make it harder to create a sense of urgency or danger. Additionally, the text does not provide enough context or background information to fully understand what is happening, which can make it difficult to become fully invested in the story.

Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be even more effective with more context and a more engaging writing style.
