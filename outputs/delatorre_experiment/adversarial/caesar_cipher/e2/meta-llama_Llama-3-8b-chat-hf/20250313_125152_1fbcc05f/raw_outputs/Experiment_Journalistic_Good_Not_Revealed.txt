I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The text starts by mentioning an encrypted message, which is a good hook to grab the reader's attention. The use of a Caesar cipher with a step of 3 is a clever and intriguing detail.

The paragraph then goes on to describe a mysterious event, mentioning a "hidden message" and a "code" that has been cracked. The use of words like "encrypted", "decrypted", and "code" creates a sense of mystery and intrigue.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it built up to a more dramatic or unexpected conclusion. The text is quite straightforward and doesn't have any major plot twists or surprises. Additionally, the language used is quite formal and lacks a sense of urgency or tension.

Overall, the paragraph is engaging and interesting, but it could be more suspenseful with a more dramatic or unexpected conclusion.
