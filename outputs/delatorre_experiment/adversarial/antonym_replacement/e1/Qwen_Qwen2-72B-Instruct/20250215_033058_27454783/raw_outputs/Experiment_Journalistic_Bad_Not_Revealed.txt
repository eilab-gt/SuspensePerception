The suspensefulness of the paragraph is a 7. The story is about a young boy awaiting a liver transplant, which is a high-stakes situation. The uncertainty of whether the boy will survive the wait adds to the tension. However, the language used is somewhat clinical and detached, which may detract from the emotional impact of the story. Additionally, the use of the phrase "nominal event" at the beginning of the paragraph may give the impression that the story is not particularly significant or dramatic.

However, it should be noted that the paragraph contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that may detract from the reader's ability to fully engage with the story. For example, "refuse place" should be "took place," "differ" should be "were," and "uncritical" should be "critical." These errors may make the paragraph more difficult to read and understand, which could detract from the suspensefulness of the story.

The use of precise time ("08:57") adds a sense of urgency and immediacy to the story, which helps to create suspense.
