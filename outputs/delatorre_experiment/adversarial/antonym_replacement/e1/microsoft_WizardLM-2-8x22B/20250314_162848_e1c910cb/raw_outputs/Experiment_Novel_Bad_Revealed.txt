The paragraph is quite suspenseful, as it sets up a scenario where a young boy's life hangs in the balance, awaiting a liver transplant. The details about the timing, the critical nature of the situation, and the last-minute availability of a donor all contribute to a sense of urgency and tension.

The conclusion of the paragraph, revealing the tragic outcome without the transplant, resolves the suspense with a poignant and impactful ending.

This paragraph builds suspense by creating a scenario where time and precision are critical. The mention of the helicopter landing on the roof of the hospital with the organ for Robert Bent's transplant sets a scene that is tense and time-sensitive. The specificity of the time (08:57) adds to the sense of urgency, suggesting that every second counts. The phrase "noncritical but unstable condition" indicates that Robert's situation is precarious, which contributes to the suspense by implying that there is a small window of opportunity to save his life. The reader is left wondering whether the organ will reach Robert in time and in suitable condition for the transplant to be successful. The suspense is moderate because the paragraph is brief and does not provide extensive detail or complications that would heighten the tension further.

This paragraph has a lower level of suspense compared to the previous ones. It focuses on the routine of a cleaner in the hospital, which provides a contrast to the high-stakes medical drama unfolding elsewhere. The description of the cleaner's work and his interactions with the environment create a sense of normalcy and mundanity rather than tension. While there is a slight buildup of suspense with the mention of the lack of warning signs and the potential for an accident, the overall tone of the paragraph is more about setting a scene and developing a character rather than creating suspense. The reader might anticipate that the cleaner's actions could have unforeseen consequences, which introduces a mild element of suspense, but it is not the primary focus of the paragraph. The suspensefulness is relatively low because the narrative does not directly engage with the critical situation of Robert Bent's transplant or any immediate danger.
