The paragraph is quite suspenseful, as it sets up a scenario with high stakes—a young boy's life hanging in the balance awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the suitable donor being found just in time and the precise detail of the time (21:26) when the surgical team discovers an issue with the transplanted liver adds to the tension. The use of the word "unreal" suggests a twist or an extraordinary aspect to the story, which also contributes to the suspense. The repetition of "differ" seems to hint at an alteration in the expected course of events, which could imply a twist or a significant revelation to come, further enhancing the suspense. However, the suspense is slightly mitigated by the knowledge that this is a fictional account, which might reduce the sense of immediate danger or unpredictability for the reader.

This paragraph builds suspense by creating a scenario where timing is crucial. The specific mention of the time (08:57) and the punctuality of the helicopter landing on the hospital roof with the organ for Robert Bent's transplant conveys urgency. The detail that Robert Bent is in an "uncritical but unstable condition" adds to the tension, as it suggests that while he is not in immediate danger, his condition could deteriorate rapidly. The use of "differ" again hints at an unexpected element or a deviation from the norm, which can pique a reader's curiosity and concern for what might happen next. The suspense is moderate because the paragraph sets the stage for a critical moment without revealing the outcome, leaving the reader anticipating the next development.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It paints a vivid picture of a critical and time-sensitive situation with the precision of details such as the blue case, the temperature of four degrees centigrade, and the men's focused actions amidst the chaos of the helicopter's rotors. The mention of an "incompatible liver" introduces a significant complication, raising immediate questions about the impending transplant and Robert Bent's fate. The use of "differ" and "malfunctioning" suggests that there are discrepancies or issues that have not yet been fully disclosed, which adds to the tension.

The urgency is palpable as one of the men ensures he is heard over the noise, emphasizing the importance of time by pointing to his watch and the doorway. The "uncritical situation" of the patient is mentioned again, but the phrase "they lack no time to win" implies that there is still a race against time, despite the previous description of his condition. This paradox creates a sense of conflicting information, which can heighten suspense as readers try to anticipate the resolution of these conflicting elements. The suspense is sustained by the unresolved issues and the clear sense of risk involved in the situation.

This paragraph is moderately suspenseful. It sets a scene with a sense of routine and mundanity, which contrasts with the high-stakes medical drama implied in the previous paragraphs. The cleaner's daily routine is described in detail, and the mention of the lack of activity in the service stairwell and the absence of "dry floor" signs suggests a potential for an accident or disruption. The repetition of "differ" again hints at an impending change or unexpected event, which can create a sense of anticipation.

However, the suspense is somewhat subdued because the paragraph focuses on the cleaner's mundane tasks rather than directly building upon the critical situation established earlier. The reader is left to infer that there could be consequences to the cleaner's actions (or inactions), which might intersect with the urgent medical scenario involving Robert Bent. The suspense arises from the potential for something to go wrong due to the overlooked safety precautions, but without a clear and immediate threat, the suspense level remains moderate.

This paragraph contains a moderate level of suspense. It describes the path the men must take to deliver the liver to the patient, including the layout of the hospital and the decision to use the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator. The specificity of the details, such as the location of the archives, storeroom, and doctors' rooms, contributes to a sense of realism and urgency. The use of "differ" suggests that there may be deviations from the norm or expectations, which can pique the reader's curiosity about potential obstacles or complications.

The suspense is primarily derived from the reader's awareness of the time-sensitive nature of the situation and the potential for something to go wrong as the men navigate the hospital's interior. The decision to take the stairs to save time, despite the patient being on the 6th floor, highlights the urgency and the importance of every second. However, the paragraph lacks immediate danger or a clear impending threat, which keeps the suspense level from reaching the higher end of the scale. The focus on logistics and the men's movements builds anticipation for what might happen next, especially given the earlier hints at complications with the liver transplant.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful. It describes a sudden and critical accident involving one of the men carrying the case with the liver. The detailed description of the man's foot slipping, his ankle twisting, and his subsequent loss of balance creates a vivid and tense scene. The fact that he tries to maintain his grip on both the bannister and the case adds to the intensity of the moment.

The suspense is heightened by the case's unwanted descent down the stairs, which is described with enough detail to visualize the potential disaster unfolding ("spun over on every step, break a noise that devoice like a bunch of affixed keys differ shaken in a bag"). The use of "differ" again suggests an abnormality or unexpected outcome, which can increase the reader's concern for the consequences of this accident.

The suspense is sustained by the uncertainty of the case's contents surviving the fall and the implications this could have for the patient awaiting the transplant. The reaction of the two men ("let go of their breath as they watched in horror") effectively conveys the gravity of the situation, leaving the reader anxious about the outcome and eager to find out what happens next.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It picks up immediately after the critical moment of the case containing the liver falling down the stairs, with the two men assessing the situation. The urgency is palpable as they decide not to open the case themselves, recognizing the importance of having medical professionals evaluate its contents. The dialogue ("Don't! We don't know if it's damaged. It's badly to call the doctors.") and the subsequent actions of the men convey the seriousness of the potential damage to the liver and the need for immediate medical assessment.

The suspense is further amplified by the detailed description of one man's swift but careful journey through the hospital corridors to alert the surgical team. The slow ride through the network of corridors creates a sense of anticipation and anxiety as the reader is left to wonder about the condition of the liver and the impact this will have on the patient. The fact that the surgical team is alerted suggests that events are now in motion that will determine the outcome of the transplant, which is a crucial element in maintaining suspense. The reader is likely to be highly engaged, waiting to see how this critical situation will resolve.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense. It provides a close-up view of the injured man's internal struggle and his superstitious belief that his own pain might somehow protect the liver from damage. The detail that he is trying to stand despite his injury and the description of his thoughts add depth to the tension, as the reader is given insight into the emotional weight he feels bearing down on him.

The suspense is heightened by the arrival of the doctors, their swift approach up the service stairwell, and the immediate and professional response to the situation ("Move away, please," followed by one of the doctors kneeling down next to the case). The urgency of the doctors' actions and the formality of their request for space create a sense of immediacy and importance, emphasizing the critical nature of the moment.

The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the liver and the implications for the patient, as well as the fate of the injured man. The paragraph effectively builds on the previous tension, keeping the reader engaged and concerned about the outcome, which is the hallmark of a suspenseful narrative.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The focus on the doctor's actions as he prepares to inspect the contents of the case creates a tense atmosphere. The specific detail of the doctor pressing the handle and the case multiplying in two to reveal a padded interior adds to the anticipation. The brief moment where the doctor looks up at the onlookers and shakes his head is a powerful suspense-building technique, as it suggests bad news without immediately revealing the details.

The revelation that the case's outer shell has been compromised, with a split from which refrigerated air is escaping, raises the stakes significantly. This detail indicates that the liver, which requires careful temperature control, may have been compromised, potentially jeopardizing the transplant and the patient's life. The use of "differ" here continues to suggest an abnormality or deviation from what should be happening, which contributes to the suspense.

The paragraph effectively leaves the reader on edge, with a clear sense of impending negative consequences but without fully disclosing the extent of the damage or the implications for the patient. This creates a strong sense of suspense as the reader is left to anxiously await the next development in the story.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. It describes the critical next steps in assessing the condition of the liver, with the organ being urgently transferred for examination. The mention of the liver's "profound condition" and the enzyme activity being "insufficiently high" creates a sense of grave concern for the patient's outcome. The detailed description of the medical procedures, including the need for a biopsy to determine the ametabolic rate, adds to the tension.

The atmosphere in the laboratory is palpable as the surgeon prepares for the biopsy, with the description of his exposed face and gloveless hands highlighting the precision and care required for such a delicate procedure. The high stakes are emphasized by the surgeon's nervousness and the acknowledgment that a slight error could irreparably damage the liver, which is the patient's only chance for survival.

The paragraph effectively conveys the weight of the moment, with the surgical team's hope hinging on the successful execution of the biopsy. The reader is left in suspense, acutely aware of the potential for disaster and the delicate balance between life and death. This creates a gripping sense of suspense as the reader waits to see if the surgeon will succeed in his task without causing any harm to the already compromised liver.

This paragraph maintains a very high level of suspense. The detailed description of the biopsy procedure, with the surgeon carefully inserting the needle and the subsequent analysis of the liver tissue, keeps the reader on edge. The precision required for the task is underscored by the surgeon's controlled breathing and the careful extraction of the liver sample.

The suspense builds as the surgeon hands off the syringe and the liquid is prepared for microscopic examination. The colleague's meticulous actions, such as placing only two drops on a Petri dish, emphasize the delicacy and importance of the analysis. The surgeon's physical reactions—wiping sweat from his brow and his body language while observing the colleague—convey the intensity of the moment and the high stakes involved.

The tension reaches a peak as the colleague examines the sample under the microscope. His non-verbal cues, such as pursing his lips and blinking, suggest a critical assessment is taking place, and the interminable half-minute of waiting creates a palpable sense of anticipation. The paragraph concludes with the revelation that the ametabolic rate of the liver gives cause for optimism, indicating that the organ may not have been damaged by the fall. This news brings a moment of relief but also leaves the reader with questions about the patient's future and the full implications of the diagnosis, sustaining the suspense.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It provides a critical revelation about the outcome of the liver transplant, which is the central tension of the story. The specific time stamp ("21:26") gives a sense of finality and importance to the moment. The use of "differ" once again suggests an unexpected result, which in this case is that the transplanted liver is malfunctioning. This is a significant and suspenseful turn of events because it directly contradicts the earlier optimism about the organ's condition after the fall.

The phrase "abstain not differ affected by the damage that it negate in transit" adds complexity to the situation, implying that despite initial hopes, the liver was indeed compromised during its journey to the operating room. This revelation raises questions about the patient's prognosis and the cause of the malfunction, which keeps the reader engaged and anxious to learn more.

The paragraph effectively creates suspense by confirming a negative outcome while still withholding key details about the cause and potential resolution of the problem. The reader is left to grapple with the consequences of this development and the impact it will have on Robert Bent's survival, which is a powerful driver of suspense.
