 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "entire medical team" and the "suitable donor." However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Robert's condition or the challenges that the medical team might face during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually," but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ or the helicopter ride, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant.  For example, "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition. As the medical team rushed to unload the organ, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as they knew that every second counted."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds to the suspense by describing the urgency of the situation and the importance of the organ, as well as the actions of the men carrying it. The use of sensory details, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "blue case," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the sense of tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the patient's critical condition and the need to "have no time to lose." Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible. Realizing that he hadn’t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. As they rushed through the hospital corridors, they could hear the beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff, all working frantically to save the life of the young boy."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story and instead provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell. While the paragraph is well-written and provides a sense of normalcy, it does not add to the tension or build anticipation for the events that are about to unfold. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to focus more on the hospital environment and the sense of urgency that is building. For example, "Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner hurriedly finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, knowing that something important was about to happen in the hospital. The service stairwell was usually quiet and empty, but today there was a sense of tension in the air. The cleaner, who preferred the more social corridors where he could chat with the doctors and patients, quickly gathered his things and took the lift back down to the ground floor, eager to start his typical working day." This paragraph sets the stage for the suspenseful events that are about to occur and creates a sense of unease in the hospital environment.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides more details about the hospital environment and the route that the men are taking to deliver the organ, which adds to the sense of urgency and tension. The use of specific details, such as the "helipad exit," "service stairwell," and "central archives," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the sense of urgency. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the patient's location on the 6th floor and the need to avoid the elevator. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital’s secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor. It’s not worth taking the lift,” he said, realising his colleague’s intention. “By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it’ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.” His colleague nodded, knowing that every second counted. As they rushed down the service stairwell, they could hear the beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff, all working frantically to save the life of the young boy."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the unexpected event of the man slipping on the stairs and dropping the case. The use of sensory details, such as the "noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the sense of urgency. The paragraph also creates a sense of danger and potential disaster, as the case could be damaged or the organ could be lost. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the dropped case or the actions of the men to retrieve it. For example, "His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. The man at the bottom of the stairs caught the case just in time, but the organ inside was jostled and the men could see it moving around inside the case. They knew that every second counted and they had to get the organ to the operating room as quickly as possible."  This paragraph adds more details about the consequences of the dropped case and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the men's concern for the organ's safety and the need to call the doctors to check for damage. The use of the phrase "We don’t know if it’s been damaged" creates a sense of uncertainty and adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the man's quick actions to alert the medical team. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of any damage to the organ or the actions of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. As he waited for the medical team to arrive, he could hear the beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff, all working frantically to save the life of the young boy. He knew that every second counted and he couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread as he waited for the medical team to arrive."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.  However, to make it even more suspenseful, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the medical team might face during the transplant. For example, "Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the man's superstition that the condition of the liver depends on his own suffering. The use of the phrase "he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall" creates a sense of uncertainty and adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the consequences of any damage to the organ or the actions of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. “Move away, please,” asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. The man hesitated, but then moved away, wincing as he put weight on his injured foot. The doctors quickly opened the case and began to examine the organ, their faces a picture of concentration as they worked to save the life of the young boy." This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.  However, to make it even more suspenseful, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the medical team might face during the transplant.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the doctor's discovery that the case has been damaged and the organ may be compromised. The use of the phrase "the fridge had ruptured with the impact" creates a sense of danger and adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the "long split down one side" and the "thin stream of refrigerated air" escaping. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the damaged organ or the actions of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The doctor's face was a picture of concern as he turned to the medical team, who were already rushing to find a solution. They knew that every second counted and they had to act quickly to save the life of the young boy."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the surgeon's nervousness and the importance of the biopsy in determining the liver's metabolic rate. The use of the phrase "If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably" creates a sense of danger and adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the "initial diagnosis" and the need to "check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy." Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the consequences of a failed biopsy. For example, "According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child’s life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. The young boy's family was waiting anxiously in the waiting room, praying for a positive outcome. The surgeon knew that every second counted and he couldn’t afford to make a mistake."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment, the patient's family, and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.  However, to make it even more suspenseful, the paragraph could provide more details about the challenges that the surgeon might face during the biopsy or the consequences of a failed biopsy. For example, "According to the initial diagnosis, the interior poly

  I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the surgeon's anxiety and the importance of the biopsy results. The use of the phrase "he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times" creates a sense of uncertainty and adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the "interminable half a minute" and the "worst fears" of the surgeon. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. The paragraph also creates a sense of disappointment and despair with the confirmation of the organ's deterioration, which adds to the suspense and increases the stakes for the transplant.  However, to make it even more suspenseful, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the consequences of a failed transplant. For example, "Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact. The young boy's family was waiting anxiously in the waiting room, praying for a positive outcome. The surgeon knew that every second counted and he couldn’t afford to make a mistake. The medical team had worked tirelessly to find a suitable donor and perform the transplant as quickly as possible, but now it seemed that all their efforts had been in vain. The boy's condition was critical and time was running out. The surgeon felt a sense of despair wash over him as he looked at the disappointed

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the failure of the transplant due to the organ's damage. The use of the phrase "Finally, at 21:26" creates a sense of urgency and adds to the suspense. The paragraph also creates a sense of disappointment and despair with the death of Robert Bent, which adds to the suspense and increases the stakes for the story. However, to make it even more suspenseful, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the consequences of his death. For example, "Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. The young boy's family was devastated by the news, and the medical team was left feeling a sense of frustration and regret. They had worked tirelessly to find a suitable donor and perform the transplant as quickly as possible, but now it seemed that all their efforts had been in vain. The boy's condition had been critical, and his family had been praying for a positive outcome. The medical team knew that every second counted, and they couldn't help but feel a sense of despair as they looked at the lifeless body of the young boy. The hospital was filled with the sound of beeping monitors and hushed voices, as the medical staff worked to save other patients. The doctors and nurses knew that they had to move on and focus on their other patients, but they couldn't help but feel a sense of loss and regret for the young boy who had been lost."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment, the patient's family, and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.  However, to make it even more suspenseful, the paragraph could provide more details about the challenges that the medical team might face in the future or the impact of Robert's death on the hospital and the medical community. For example, "Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. The young boy's family was devastated by
