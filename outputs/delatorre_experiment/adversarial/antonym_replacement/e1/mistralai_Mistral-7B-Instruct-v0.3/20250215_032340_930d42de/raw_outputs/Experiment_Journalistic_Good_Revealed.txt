The uncertainty about the donor's arrival and the boy's survival heightens the suspense. The cliffhanger ending with the liver not functioning properly adds to the suspense, leaving the reader eager to know what happens next. However, the title "What dematerialize" is somewhat vague and does not contribute significantly to the suspense.
