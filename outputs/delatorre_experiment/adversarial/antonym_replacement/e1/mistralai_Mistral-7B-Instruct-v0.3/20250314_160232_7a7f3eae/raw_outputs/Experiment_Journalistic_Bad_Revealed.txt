 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The narrative builds tension through the use of a specific date, the uncertainty about the donor and Robert's condition, and the impending liver transplant. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the repeated use of the word "now" and the specific time when Robert is declared dead. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the events leading up to the transplant and the emotions of the characters involved.

At 08: 57, the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital, where Robert Bent lay in a noncritical but unstable condition, his family and the surgical team anxiously awaiting the arrival of the organ that could save his life. The helicopter's blades whirred ominously as it descended, and the team rushed to unload the precious cargo. But as they opened the door, they found that the organ was damaged beyond repair, and Robert's chances of survival plummeted. The room fell silent as the team struggled to come to terms with the devastating news, and the hope that had been building for hours dissipated like smoke in the wind.
