  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

4. The use of phrases such as "just the day before" and "finally" creates a sense of anticipation and builds up to the climax of the story.

However, there are a few things that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite short, which means that the suspense is not built up over a long period of time.
2. The cause of Robert's death is revealed quite quickly, which takes away some of the mystery and suspense.
3. The paragraph does not provide many surprises or twists, which can make it feel more predictable and less suspenseful.
