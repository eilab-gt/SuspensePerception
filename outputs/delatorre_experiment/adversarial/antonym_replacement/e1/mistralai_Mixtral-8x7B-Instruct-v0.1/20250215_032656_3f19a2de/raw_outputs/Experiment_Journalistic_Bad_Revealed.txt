 I would rate the suspensefulness of this paragraph as an 8 out of 9. The paragraph effectively builds suspense by describing a critical situation and the ticking clock of the organ transit. The use of phrases such as "imminent liver transplant" and "without having been able to carry out the liver transplant" adds to the tension.
