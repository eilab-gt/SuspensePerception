 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension and anticipation with the description of the helicopter landing and the mention of the boy's critical condition, it lacks the same level of detail and urgency as the previous paragraph. The paragraph does not provide any context or background information about the situation, and it does not hint at any potential problems or complications that may arise.

  I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph adds to the tension and anticipation established in the previous paragraph by describing the arrival of the organ and the men who brought it. The use of the word "case" to describe the container for the liver adds a sense of mystery and intrigue, as the reader may wonder what could be inside.

However, the paragraph still lacks some of the context and background information that would make it more engaging and suspenseful for the reader. 

Overall, I would say that the three paragraphs together form a suspenseful narrative, with the first paragraph establishing the urgency and tension of the situation, the second paragraph adding to that tension with the arrival of the organ, and the third paragraph further heightening the suspense with the description of the liver and its container. When read together, these paragraphs create a cohesive and suspenseful story that is sure to keep the reader engaged.
