I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by setting the scene for a potentially life-or-death situation, introducing a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the medical team's certification of Robert's death, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more intense.

However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it had more dramatic language and a greater sense of emotional investment in the characters. For example, the paragraph could describe Robert's condition in more vivid terms, or explore the emotional toll of the medical team's failure to save him. Additionally, the paragraph could benefit from more foreshadowing or hints at the tragic outcome, rather than simply stating it outright. Overall, while the paragraph is suspenseful, it could be even more effective with some additional narrative techniques.
