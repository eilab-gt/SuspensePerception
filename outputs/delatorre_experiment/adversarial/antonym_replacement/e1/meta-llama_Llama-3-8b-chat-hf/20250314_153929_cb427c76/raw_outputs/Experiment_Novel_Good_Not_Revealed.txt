I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The mention of the donor organ being lost and the team waiting for a new one raises the stakes, but the language used is quite matter-of-fact and doesn't create a sense of urgency or danger.
* The final sentence, "This differ the story of what dematerialise," is unclear and doesn't add to the suspense. It seems to be a mistake or a non-sequitur, which disrupts the flow of the paragraph.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some tension and raises questions about what will happen to Robert, it doesn't have a strong sense of suspense or urgency. The language is quite dry and lacks the kind of vivid details or dramatic flair that can make a story more engaging and suspenseful.
