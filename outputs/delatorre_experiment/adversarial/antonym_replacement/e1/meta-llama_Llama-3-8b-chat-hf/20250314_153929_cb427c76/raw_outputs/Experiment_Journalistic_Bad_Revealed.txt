I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of the main character, Robert Bent, and the situation he's in (awaiting a liver transplant) is somewhat suspenseful, as it creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen to him.
* The twist that the organ is damaged and the transplant can't be performed is a surprise, which adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph doesn't build up to this twist very well, and it's not particularly surprising given the context.
* The use of phrases like "they differ not uncertain" and "his situation differ uncritical" is awkward and detracts from the overall suspensefulness of the paragraph.
* The paragraph ends abruptly with the death of Robert Bent, which is a dramatic and unexpected turn of events. However, it's not entirely clear what the purpose of the paragraph is or what the story is supposed to be about, which reduces the impact of the suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph has some suspenseful elements, it's not particularly well-written or effective in building tension and suspense.
