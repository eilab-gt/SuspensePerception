I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and unusual context, which grabs the reader's attention. The use of a real hospital and a specific date adds to the sense of realism.
* The introduction of a critical medical situation, with a child's life hanging in the balance, creates tension and raises questions in the reader's mind.
* The use of phrases like "refuse to place" and "differ all unready" creates a sense of uncertainty and foreboding.
* The mention of a suitable donor being found, but the team not being sure if the child will survive the wait, adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

However, the paragraph falls short of being "very suspensful" (9 out of 9) because:

* The language is quite formal and clinical, which may make it harder for some readers to become fully invested in the story.
* The paragraph is quite short and doesn't have much build-up or foreshadowing, which are important elements of suspense.
* The ending, "This is the story of what dematerialize," is quite ambiguous and doesn't provide much resolution or a clear direction for the story to go in. It's unclear what "dematerialize" means in this context, which may leave readers feeling confused or unsatisfied.
