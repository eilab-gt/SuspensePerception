I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is good for building tension. It's clear that the story is about a life-or-death situation, which is inherently suspenseful.
* The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the situation feel more urgent.
* The paragraph also raises questions, such as "Would Robert succumb to the wait?" which keeps the reader engaged and curious.
* However, the paragraph is quite straightforward and lacks a sense of tension or urgency. The language is formal and clinical, which makes it feel more like a medical report than a suspenseful story.
* The use of phrases like "unready for his imminent liver transplant" and "awaiting the arrival of the organ" is a bit too matter-of-fact to create a sense of suspense.
* The resolution of the story, where the liver transplant is successful, is also a bit too quick and easy to create a sense of tension or uncertainty.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it's not particularly effective at building tension or keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by introducing a sense of urgency with the use of a specific time ("08:57") and a dramatic event (the helicopter landing).
* The fact that the helicopter is carrying an organ adds to the sense of importance and raises the stakes.
* The description of Robert Bent's condition as "uncritical but unstable" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what might happen next.
* The use of the word "punctually" to describe the helicopter's landing adds a sense of precision and timing, which can create a sense of anticipation and expectation.

However, the paragraph is still relatively short and lacks a sense of build-up or escalation. The tension is mostly created by the situation itself, rather than the language or pacing of the paragraph. Additionally, the paragraph is quite straightforward and lacks any real surprises or twists, which can make it feel a bit predictable.

Overall, while the paragraph has some suspenseful elements, it's not particularly effective at building tension or keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by creating a sense of tension and urgency with the description of the helicopter's rotors and the two men emerging from it. The use of words like "whirlwind" and "spinning blades" creates a sense of chaos and danger.
* The introduction of the blue case and the liver inside it raises the stakes and creates a sense of importance. The fact that it's being transported at a specific temperature and is fully functioning adds to the sense of urgency.
* The whispering and the pointing at the watch and the doorway creates a sense of mystery and raises questions in the reader's mind. What are they trying to communicate? What's the hurry?
* The use of phrases like "realizing that he hadn't fail to make himself heard over the noise of the blades" and "lack no time to break even" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The fact that the men are moving quickly and quietly towards the exit creates a sense of tension and anticipation. The reader is left wondering what's going to happen next and what kind of situation they're walking into.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still quite descriptive and doesn't have any real surprises or twists. The tension is mostly created by the situation itself, rather than the language or pacing of the paragraph. Additionally, the paragraph is quite long and could be broken up to create more of a sense of pace and rhythm.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is extremely descriptive and focuses on the mundane details of the cleaner's job, such as the color of the fire extinguishers and the layout of the service stairwell. This creates a sense of boredom and lack of tension.
* The cleaner's thoughts and feelings are also described in detail, which makes the scene feel more like a character study than a suspenseful scene.
* The paragraph is very long and meandering, which makes it feel slow-paced and uneventful.
* There is no sense of urgency or danger, and the cleaner's actions are routine and unremarkable.
* The only slightly interesting detail is the fact that the cleaner didn't put up the "wet floor" warning signs, but this is not enough to create a sense of tension or suspense.

Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful at all. It's a very slow-paced and descriptive scene that focuses on the mundane details of the cleaner's job.
