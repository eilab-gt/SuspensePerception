This makes it difficult to follow and diminishes the potential suspense.

2. **Lack of Tension**: While the situation (a child awaiting a liver transplant) is inherently tense, the writing does not effectively build suspense. The stakes are mentioned ("they differ not uncertain if Robert would succumb the wait"), but the phrasing is unclear and lacks emotional impact.

3. **No Immediate Threat**: The paragraph does not create a sense of urgency or immediate danger. The situation is described as "noncritical," which reduces the potential for suspense.

4. **No Cliffhanger or Twist**: The paragraph ends with "This differ the story of what dematerialise," which is vague and does not leave the reader eager to find out what happens next.
