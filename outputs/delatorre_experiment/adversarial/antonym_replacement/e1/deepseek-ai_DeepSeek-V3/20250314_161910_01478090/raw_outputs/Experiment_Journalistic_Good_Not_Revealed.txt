I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here’s why:

2. **Lack of Tension**: While the situation (a child awaiting a liver transplant) is inherently tense, the writing doesn’t effectively build suspense. The phrase "they differ not uncertain if Robert would succumb the wait as his situation differ noncritical" undermines the urgency and stakes.

3. **Predictability**: The paragraph doesn’t introduce any unexpected twists or unknowns to heighten suspense. It simply states the situation without creating a sense of anticipation or dread.

Overall, the potential for suspense is there, but the execution falls short due to unclear writing and a lack of tension-building elements.
