I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Grammar and Clarity**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., "differ," "abstain," "negate"). This makes it hard to engage with the story and feel suspense.
2. **Emotional Weight**: The subject matter (a child’s death) is inherently emotional, but the writing doesn’t effectively convey the tension or urgency of the situation.
3. **Pacing**: The paragraph doesn’t build suspense effectively. It jumps from one point to another without creating a sense of anticipation or dread.
4. **Outcome Revealed Early**: The fact that Robert dies is revealed early in the paragraph, which diminishes any potential suspense about his fate.

While the topic has the potential to be suspenseful, the execution here doesn’t effectively create that feeling.

1. **Visual and Sensory Details**: The description of the men emerging from the helicopter, the spinning blades, and the blue case containing the liver creates a vivid and tense scene. These details help build suspense.
