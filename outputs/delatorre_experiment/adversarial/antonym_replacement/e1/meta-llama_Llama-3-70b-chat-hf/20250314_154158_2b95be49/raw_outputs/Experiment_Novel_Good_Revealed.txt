I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful scenario: a young boy is waiting for a liver transplant, and his situation is critical. The reader is invested in Robert's fate and wants to know what happens next. However, the paragraph's execution undermines the suspense in several ways:

* The sentence structure and word choice are awkward and distracting, which takes the reader out of the story.
* The use of "differ" instead of "were" or "was" is confusing and slows down the reader's progress.
* The paragraph gives away the outcome of the story in the first sentence, which reduces the suspense. If the reader knows that something "unreal" is going to happen, they're not as invested in the setup.
* The paragraph focuses more on setting up the scene and explaining the situation than on creating tension or suspense. The language is fairly straightforward and lacks a sense of urgency or foreboding.

Overall, while the scenario has potential for suspense, the execution falls short. A more suspenseful paragraph would create a sense of tension and uncertainty, and would likely withhold the outcome of the story until later.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and importance by specifying the exact time of the helicopter's arrival, which adds to the tension.
* The fact that the helicopter is carrying the organ and has landed on the roof of the hospital creates a sense of anticipation and raises the stakes.
* The phrase "uncritical but unstable condition" implies that Robert's situation is precarious and could go either way, which adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat undermined by:

* The continued use of "differ" instead of "was", which is still distracting and takes the reader out of the story.
* The lack of emotional connection to Robert's character. We're told he's in a bad condition, but we don't feel it. Adding more sensory details or emotional context could make the reader more invested in Robert's fate.
* The sentence is fairly straightforward and lacks a sense of surprise or unexpected twist. The helicopter landing on the roof is a predictable event, and the paragraph doesn't subvert our expectations or create a sense of surprise.

Overall, the paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous one, but it could be improved with more attention to sentence-level craft and emotional resonance.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a vivid and immersive scene, with sensory details like the rotors, whirlwind, and spinning blades. This helps the reader feel like they're right there on the rooftop with the characters.
* The use of descriptive language like "heads down and hair conserve" and "meagerly malfunctioning" adds to the sense of tension and foreboding.
* The introduction of the blue case and the incompatible liver raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The fact that the liver is "meagerly malfunctioning" implies that time is of the essence.
* The dialogue and body language between the two men is subtle but effective in conveying their sense of urgency and gravity. The whispered conversation, the nod, and the glance at the watch all contribute to a sense of tension.
* The sentence "During the journey they refuse differ told that the patient differ in a uncritical situation and they lack no time to win" is particularly effective in ratcheting up the suspense. The use of "refuse" instead of "were told" implies a sense of denial or avoidance, and the phrase "no time to win" is ominous and unclear.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat undermined by:

* The continued use of "differ" instead of "were" or "was", which is still distracting and takes the reader out of the story.
* Some of the sentence structures and word choices are still a bit awkward, which can slow down the reader's progress and reduce the sense of tension.

Overall, this paragraph is much more suspenseful than the previous two, and the vivid scene-setting and subtle character interactions help to create a sense of tension and urgency. With some further refinement of the language and sentence structure, this paragraph could be even more effective at building suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is primarily focused on describing the daily routine of a cleaner in a hospital, which is a mundane and ordinary activity. There's no sense of urgency, danger, or high stakes.
* The language is straightforward and lacks any sense of tension or foreboding. The use of words like "uninteresting", "dull", and "disagreeable" creates a sense of monotony rather than suspense.
* The paragraph is heavy on descriptive details, but they're all focused on the cleaner's routine and the hospital's layout. There's no sense of mystery or intrigue.
* The cleaner's whistling and lack of concern about positioning warning signs suggests a sense of complacency rather than tension.
* The paragraph's tone is more observational and matter-of-fact than suspenseful. The reader is not invested in the cleaner's activities or worried about what might happen next.

The only potential source of suspense is the fact that the cleaner is not following protocol by not putting up warning signs, but this is not played up as a significant risk or danger. Overall, this paragraph is more focused on establishing a sense of routine and normalcy than creating suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The description of the corridor and its contents is brief but effective in creating a sense of familiarity and normalcy, which makes the unusual event (the liver transplant) stand out more.

* The image of the colleague shrugging and grasping the bannister with his unfree hand creates a sense of hesitation and uncertainty, which adds to the tension.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat undermined by:

* The continued use of "differ" instead of "were" or "was", which is still distracting and takes the reader out of the story.
* The lack of emotional connection to the characters. We don't know much about them or their motivations, which makes it harder to invest in their actions and decisions.
* The paragraph is still fairly straightforward and lacks any major surprises or twists. The tension is mostly created by the sense of urgency and the importance of the task at hand.

Overall, this paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous one, and the use of descriptive language and concise dialogue helps to create a sense of tension and urgency.
