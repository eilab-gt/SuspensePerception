* The setup for the story is straightforward and lacks any sense of foreboding or ominous tone.
* The use of phrases like "differ all unready" and "differ not unsure" creates a sense of detachment and awkwardness, rather than building tension.
* The story unfolds in a fairly predictable and matter-of-fact way, with no surprises or twists to keep the reader on edge.
* The outcome of the story (Robert's death) is revealed in a straightforward and unemotional way, without any sense of drama or suspense.

* Unanswered questions: While the paragraph raises some questions, it doesn't leave the reader with a cliffhanger or a sense of uncertainty that would keep them on edge.
