I would rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors make it difficult to follow the story and create any sense of tension. 
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("differ place," "differ unready," "differ abolish") distances the reader from the action and reduces the emotional impact.
* **Lack of Vivid Language:** The writing lacks sensory details and strong verbs that could evoke a sense of urgency or danger.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammar:**  Clear and concise language is essential for building suspense.
* **Use active voice:**  Active voice makes the writing more direct and engaging.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital environment.
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Show his fear, hope, and vulnerability.
* **Create a ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time Robert has before the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually" create a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the organ's arrival with Robert's "uncritical but unstable" condition raises the stakes and introduces a sense of uncertainty.

**However:**

* **Limited Information:** We don't know enough about Robert's condition or the potential complications to feel truly invested in the outcome.
* **Passive Voice:** "Robert Bent differ in a uncritical but unstable condition" is still written in passive voice, which weakens the impact.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the reactions of the medical team.
* **Internal Monologue:** Give us a glimpse into Robert's thoughts and feelings as he awaits the transplant.
* **Foreshadowing:** Hint at potential obstacles or dangers that could arise during the procedure.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

**Here's why:**

* **Action and Urgency:** The description of the men rushing from the helicopter with the vital organ creates a sense of immediacy and purpose.
* **Obstacles:** The mention of the "meagerly malfunctioning" liver and the need to act quickly adds tension and raises the stakes.
* **Limited Communication:** The whispered conversation and the reliance on gestures create a sense of secrecy and urgency.

**Areas for improvement:**

* **Clarity:** Some sentences are awkwardly phrased and could be clearer (e.g., "The same whisper something audible").
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating that the men are in a hurry, show their urgency through their actions and body language.
* **Sensory Details:**  Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the rooftop to immerse the reader in the scene.
* **Emotional Connection:** Give us a glimpse into the men's thoughts and feelings as they carry the precious cargo.

By refining the language and adding more sensory detail, this paragraph could be even more suspenseful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale.

**Here's why:**

* **Mundane Setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of the stairwell create a sense of ordinariness, which works against suspense.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There's no immediate threat or danger presented. The cleaner's job is described as "disagreeable" but not inherently suspenseful.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("differ never positioned," "differ never a bored patient") makes the writing feel distant and unemotional.

**Potential for Suspense:**

While this paragraph isn't suspenseful on its own, it could be used to set up suspense later in the story. For example:

* **Foreshadowing:** The cleaner's casual disregard for safety (not putting up warning signs) could foreshadow a potential accident.
* **Juxtaposition:** The mundane routine could be contrasted with a sudden, unexpected event, creating a jarring effect.
* **Unreliable Narrator:** The cleaner's perspective could be unreliable, hinting at something sinister lurking beneath the surface.



To make this paragraph more suspenseful, you'd need to introduce a conflict, a sense of danger, or a hint of something unusual.

**What could be improved:**

* **Sensory Details:**  Adding more sensory details about the hospital environment (sounds, smells, sights) would further immerse the reader in the scene.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating that the men are in a hurry, show their urgency through their actions and body language.
* **Foreshadowing:**  Subtly hinting at potential dangers or complications lurking in the hospital corridors could heighten the suspense.

* **Internal Monologue:** Give us a glimpse into the thoughts and fears of the man rushing to alert the doctors.

**Overall:**

While this paragraph maintains a sense of suspense, it could be more gripping by focusing on the characters' emotional responses and using more vivid language to create a more immersive experience.

####################################################################################################
I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Anti-climactic Ending:** After building suspense throughout the story, the final paragraph feels somewhat abrupt and anticlimactic. The declaration of Robert's death is stated matter-of-factly, without much emotional weight.
* **Lack of Closure:** The paragraph doesn't offer much closure or reflection on the events that led to this outcome. It simply states the facts, leaving the reader with a sense of incompleteness.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the surgical team decertify") further distances the reader from the emotional impact of the situation.

**What could be improved:**

* **Emotional Impact:** Show the reactions of the surgical team, Robert's family, or other characters to the news of his death.
* **Reflection:** Add a few sentences reflecting on the tragedy of the situation, the importance of organ donation, or the fragility of life.
* **Active Voice:** Use active voice to make the writing more direct and engaging.



While the paragraph effectively conveys the outcome, it lacks the emotional punch and sense of closure that would make it truly suspenseful.
