I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention. The high stakes of a liver transplant and the mention of a child create inherent suspense.
* **Ticking clock:** The mention of waiting since 8 am and the critical condition of Robert build tension.
* **Unclear outcome:** The paragraph hints at a potential tragedy but doesn't explicitly state what happened.

**However:**

* **Grammatical errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of vivid detail:** The paragraph lacks sensory details and emotional depth, which could further enhance the suspense.
* **Abrupt ending:** The final sentence feels rushed and anticlimactic.


With some revisions to improve clarity and add more descriptive language, this paragraph could be much more suspenseful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Establishes a timeline:** The precise time adds a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Juxtaposition:** The contrast between the punctuality of the helicopter and Robert's "noncritical but unstable" condition creates a slight sense of unease.

**However:**

* **Passive voice:** The use of passive voice ("differ in a noncritical...") makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.
* **Short length:** The paragraph is too brief to build significant suspense.


This paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Robert's condition, the importance of the organ, and the potential consequences of a delay.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Action and urgency:** The description of the men rushing from the helicopter with the vital organ creates a sense of urgency and action.
* **Sensory details:** The details about the spinning blades, the blue case, and the whispered conversation add a layer of realism and immediacy.

**However:**

* **Awkward phrasing:** Some sentences are awkwardly phrased, which can detract from the suspense. For example, "Realizing that he hadn’t fail to unmake himself heard..." could be rewritten more smoothly.
* **Lack of emotional connection:** We don't get a strong sense of the characters' emotions or the weight of the situation.

Overall, this paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be even more effective with some revisions to improve clarity and emotional impact.
