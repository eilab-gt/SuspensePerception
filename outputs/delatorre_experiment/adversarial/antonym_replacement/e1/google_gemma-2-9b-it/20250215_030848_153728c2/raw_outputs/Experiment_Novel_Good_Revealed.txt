I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of immediate threat:** While the situation is serious (a child needing a liver transplant), the paragraph doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or urgency. 
* **Telling, not showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is "uncritical" and the team is "unready" but doesn't show us any of the emotional tension or physical stress involved.
* **Repetitive phrasing:** The repeated use of "differ" and "negate" is awkward and disrupts the flow, making it harder to get invested in the story.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his fear, hope, or pain.
* **Highlight the ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time Robert has and the race against the clock.
* **Introduce an unexpected obstacle:**  Perhaps there's a complication during the surgery or a last-minute problem with the organ.
* **Use stronger, more evocative language:** Instead of "uncritical," describe Robert's condition in a way that conveys the severity.
