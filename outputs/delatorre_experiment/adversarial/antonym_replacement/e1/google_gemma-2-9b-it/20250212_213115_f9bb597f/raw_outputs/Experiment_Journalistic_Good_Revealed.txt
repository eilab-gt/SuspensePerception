I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a critical situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph establishes a clear sense of urgency with the impending transplant and Robert's precarious condition. 
* **Lack of Conflict:**  While the situation is tense, there's no real conflict or obstacle presented. We know the transplant happens successfully, so the suspense is lessened.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the tension ("Robert's situation was critical") rather than showing it through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on the unknown:**  Highlight the uncertainty surrounding the donor organ's condition or the potential complications of the surgery.
* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps there's a last-minute problem with the organ, a delay, or a complication during the procedure.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the atmosphere in the hospital, the sounds, the smells, and the emotions of the medical team and Robert's family.
