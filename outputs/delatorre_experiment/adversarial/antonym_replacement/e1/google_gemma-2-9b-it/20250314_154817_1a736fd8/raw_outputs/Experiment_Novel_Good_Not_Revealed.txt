I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "will," "unreal" instead of "unreal," etc.) distract from the potential suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Sensory Detail:** The paragraph tells us about the situation but doesn't create a vivid picture in the reader's mind. We don't feel the tension, the fear, or the urgency of the situation.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is "uncritical" but doesn't show us why.  We need to see his struggle, hear his pain, or witness the team's worry to truly feel the suspense.
* **Vague Threat:** The phrase "what dematerialise" is confusing and doesn't create a clear sense of danger. What will dematerialize? Robert? The hope for a transplant?

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar and punctuation.**
* **Use vivid language and sensory details.** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's physical state, and the emotions of the surgical team.
* **Show, don't tell.** Instead of saying Robert's situation is "uncritical," describe his labored breathing, his pale skin, or his weak pulse.
* **Create a clear and immediate threat.** What is at stake for Robert? What will happen if he doesn't get the transplant?

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Clarity:** The grammar is fixed, making the sentence easier to understand.
* **Time Element:** The specific time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Contrasting Information:** The juxtaposition of "punctually" and "noncritical but unstable" creates a slight tension. We know the organ arrived on time, but Robert's condition is still precarious.

**However, it still lacks:**

* **Sensory Details:** We don't feel the tension in the air, the frantic activity inside the hospital, or Robert's own fear or hope.
* **Emotional Connection:** We don't know enough about Robert or the team to truly invest in his fate.
* **Clear Stakes:** While we understand Robert is in a bad way, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state what will happen if he doesn't get the transplant.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying Robert is "noncritical but unstable," describe his labored breathing, his pale skin, or the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Build anticipation:**  Describe the helicopter's arrival, the rush to transport the organ, and the team's preparations for the surgery.

Here's why:

* **Improved Imagery:** The description of the helicopter blades and the men's actions creates a more vivid scene.
* **Intriguing Details:** The mention of the "incompatible liver" and the whispered conversation adds a layer of mystery and raises questions.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The emphasis on time ("pointed at the watch," "no time to find") creates a sense of urgency.

**However, it still needs work:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** While better than the previous versions, there are still some grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "did," "unmake" instead of "make," etc.).
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the tension or anxiety of the situation. We don't know enough about the men or their motivations.
* **Vague Threat:** What does it mean that the liver is "incompatible"? What are the consequences if they don't get it to the patient in time?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on the characters' emotions:** Describe their expressions, their thoughts, their physical reactions to the pressure.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There's no immediate threat, danger, or mystery.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("the cleaner refuse begin," "the staff used the lifts," etc.) makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.
* **Unclear Purpose:**  It's unclear why this seemingly ordinary scene is being presented. What is the point of focusing on the cleaner's routine?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a disruption:**  Something unexpected could happen to break the routine. Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual, hears a strange noise, or encounters a suspicious person.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Use sensory details to create a slightly unsettling atmosphere. Describe flickering lights, strange shadows, or a feeling of being watched.
* **Hint at a larger story:**  Subtly suggest that there's something more going on beneath the surface. Perhaps the cleaner is hiding something, or the hospital itself holds a dark secret.

####################################################################################################
I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Tension:** The paragraph states the outcome directly, removing any suspense. We already know the liver is going to be okay.

* **Delay the Resolution:** Instead of stating the outcome directly, build up to it. Describe the team's anxious wait for the results, their hopeful glances at the monitors, their whispered prayers.

* **Focus on the Characters:**  Describe the emotional reactions of the surgical team, Robert's family, and anyone else involved in the situation.



This paragraph needs a complete rewrite to create any real suspense.  Focus on the emotional journey and the uncertainty leading up to the positive outcome.
