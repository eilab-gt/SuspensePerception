I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "were,"  "abstain" instead of "occur," etc.) distract from the potential suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Pacing:** The paragraph tells us a lot of information upfront (the date, the location, the boy's name, the situation) without building any real tension. 
* **Flat Emotional Impact:**  While the situation is clearly serious, the writing doesn't evoke much emotional response from the reader. We're told Robert is in danger, but we don't feel it.
* **Unsatisfying Ending:** The phrase "This differ the story of what dematerialise" is confusing and anticlimactic. It doesn't leave the reader wanting to know more.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's condition, the emotions of the surgical team.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** Use shorter sentences, active voice, and words that convey a sense of immediacy.
* **Build Tension Gradually:**  Hint at the potential for tragedy without revealing too much too soon.
* **End with a Hook:**  Leave the reader with a question or a cliffhanger that makes them want to read more.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Pacing:** The specific time and the arrival of the helicopter introduce a sense of urgency.
* **Clear Stakes:** We know Robert is in a precarious condition, making the arrival of the organ crucial.

However, it still lacks some elements to make it truly suspenseful:

* **Limited Emotional Impact:** We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's desperation.
* **Lack of Conflict:**  The helicopter landing "punctually" suggests everything is going smoothly, which undermines the potential for suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** "Robert Bent differ in a noncritical but unstable condition" is a bit clunky and passive.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his labored breathing, his pale skin, or the worried faces of his family.
* **Introduce Obstacles:**  Perhaps there's a delay in getting the organ to the operating room, or a complication arises during the transport.
* **Use Active Voice:**  "Robert Bent lay in a noncritical but unstable condition" is more impactful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Stronger Visuals:** The description of the men battling the wind and the blue case containing the vital organ creates a more vivid and engaging scene.
* **Heightened Stakes:** The mention of the liver being "incompatible" and the urgency of the situation ("they lack no time to win") adds tension.

However, it still has room for improvement:

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph still contains some awkward phrasing and grammatical errors ("differ no longer unbend," "starve a invisible nod").
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the weight of the situation through the characters' emotions.
* **Telling Instead of Showing:** Phrases like "they lack no time to win" tell us about the urgency, but showing us the characters racing against time would be more impactful.

**To boost the suspense further:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter blades, the smell of antiseptic in the air, the pounding of the men's hearts.
* **Show the Characters' Reactions:**  Let us see their fear, determination, or desperation.
* **Create a Ticking Clock:**  Use specific time references or actions to emphasize the urgency of the situation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane routine. There's no immediate threat or danger.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("the cleaner lack begin," "the staff used the lifts," etc.) makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.
* **Unclear Purpose:**  It's unclear why we're being told about this cleaner's routine. There's no hint of a mystery or a plot twist.
