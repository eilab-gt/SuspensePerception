I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a life-or-death situation with a pending liver transplant immediately grabs attention.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of "imminent" transplant and Robert's "uncritical" condition creates a sense of urgency.
* **Unclear Outcome:** The phrase "This is the story of what dematerialize" is intriguing but vague, leaving the reader wondering what will happen.

**However, the paragraph suffers from:**

* **Awkward Phrasing:** The writing is clunky and grammatically incorrect, which detracts from the suspense. 
* **Lack of Sensory Details:** There's little description to immerse the reader in the scene or evoke emotional response.
* **Telling Instead of Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical but doesn't show us through his actions or thoughts.


With some revisions to improve the flow and add sensory details, this paragraph could be much more suspenseful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually" create a sense of urgency and anticipation.

* **Adding Robert's perspective:**  Show his thoughts and feelings as he awaits the organ.
* **Describing the atmosphere:**  Is the hospital bustling with activity? Is there a palpable sense of hope and fear?
* **Ending on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader wondering if the transplant will be successful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Image:** The description of the "large blue fridge" as a case containing the liver is unusual and creates a sense of mystery.
* **Emphasis on Malfunction:** The word "meagerly malfunctioning" adds a layer of uncertainty and danger to the situation.

* **Adding Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds, smells, or weather conditions to create a more immersive experience.
* **Building Tension:**  Use shorter sentences or more active verbs to create a faster pace.

* **Unclear Stakes:** There's no sense of danger or urgency associated with the cleaner mopping the floor.

* **Clearer Writing:**  Rewrite the sentence to be concise and easy to understand.



As it stands, the paragraph feels disconnected and lacks any real suspense.

* **Hinting at a potential danger:**  Is there a reason why they shouldn't be using the service stairwell?
