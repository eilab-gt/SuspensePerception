I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the potential suspense.  The writing is confusing and makes it hard to follow the story.
* **Lack of Tension Building:**  While the situation described (a child needing a transplant) has inherent tension, the paragraph doesn't build it effectively.  There are no cliffhangers, rising action, or vivid descriptions to keep the reader on edge.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical and the transplant is risky, but it doesn't show us through sensory details or emotional reactions.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear and concise writing is essential for building suspense.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's fear, the team's anxiety.
* **Use active voice:**  "The surgical team verified" is passive.  Try "The surgical team discovered" for a more active and engaging tone.
* **Create a cliffhanger:**  End the paragraph on a note that leaves the reader wanting more. For example, you could end with a line like, "But as the surgeon made the final incision, a chilling realization dawned..."

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Clarity:** The grammar is much better than the previous paragraph, making it easier to follow.
* **Time Element:** The specific time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Contrasting Information:** The juxtaposition of the helicopter's punctuality with Robert's critical condition creates a slight tension.

**However, it still lacks:**

* **Emotional Impact:** We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's desperation.
* **Rising Action:** There's no build-up to a climax or a sense of something dangerous about to happen.
* **Intriguing Details:** The paragraph is quite bare-bones.  What kind of organ is it? What are the risks involved?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying Robert is "uncritical but unstable," describe his labored breathing, the beeping of machines, or the worried faces of the nurses.
* **Add Sensory Details:** Describe the whirring of the helicopter blades, the smell of antiseptic in the air, the tense silence in the operating room.
* **Hint at Danger:**  Perhaps the helicopter encounters turbulence, or there's a last-minute complication with the organ.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Flow:** The grammar is much better, making the paragraph flow more smoothly.
* **Visual Details:**  The description of the men battling the wind and the blue case containing the liver adds a sense of urgency and visual interest.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the watch and the need to "win" creates a sense of urgency.

**However, it still needs work:**

* **Unclear Stakes:** We don't fully understand the danger. Why is the liver "incompatible"? What will happen if they don't make it in time?
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the tension or fear of the men carrying the organ.
* **Telling, Not Showing:**  Phrases like "they lack no time to win" tell us about the urgency, but don't show it through action or description.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show the Danger:**  Describe the liver's condition in more detail.  Perhaps it's starting to deteriorate, or there's a risk of contamination.
* **Focus on the Men's Emotions:**  Show their anxiety, determination, or fear through their actions, thoughts, or dialogue.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or anything out of the ordinary.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("the cleaner refuse begin," "the staff used the lifts") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.
* **Uninteresting Details:** The focus on the cleaning routine and the placement of fire extinguishers is not inherently suspenseful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setting:** The description of the helipad exit, service stairwell, and hospital corridors creates a sense of place and atmosphere.
* **Limited Options:** The men's decision to take the stairs instead of the lift adds a layer of tension. It suggests a sense of urgency or a possible reason to avoid the lift.
* **Dialogue:** The brief dialogue between the men reveals their awareness of time constraints and adds a touch of realism.

**However, it still needs some work:**

* **Lack of Clear Stakes:** We don't fully understand the urgency of the situation. Why is it so important to get to the 6th floor quickly? What are the consequences if they don't?
* **Passive Voice:**  Phrases like "the man carrying the case be born to drop out" are a bit clunky and could be made more active.
* **Missing Emotional Impact:** We don't feel the men's anxiety or determination.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Raise the Stakes:**  Hint at a potential danger or a life-or-death situation.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying they are in a hurry, describe their hurried footsteps, their quick breaths, or the sweat on their brows.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Tension:** The paragraph states the outcome of the situation directly, removing any suspense. We already know the liver is functioning properly from the previous paragraph.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the liver is functioning correctly, but it doesn't show us. We don't see the relief on the surgical team's faces, hear their sighs of relief, or feel the tension dissipate.

* **Add Sensory Details:**  Describe the sounds of the operating room, the smell of antiseptic, the feeling of relief in the air.
