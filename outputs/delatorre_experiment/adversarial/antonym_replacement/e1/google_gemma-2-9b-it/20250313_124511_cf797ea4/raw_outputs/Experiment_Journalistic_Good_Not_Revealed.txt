I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "will differ,"  incorrect punctuation) distract the reader and make it harder to get invested in the story.
* **Lack of Tension:** While the situation (a child awaiting a life-saving transplant) has inherent potential for suspense, the paragraph doesn't build any real tension.  We're told Robert's situation is "noncritical," which undermines the sense of urgency.
* **Vague Language:** Phrases like "what dematerialize" are confusing and don't create a clear sense of what's at stake.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear and correct language is essential for engaging the reader.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's emotions, the ticking clock, etc. to create a more immersive experience.
* **Raise the stakes:**  Highlight the risks involved in the transplant and the potential consequences if it fails.
* **Create a sense of mystery:**  Hint at something unexpected or unknown that might happen.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Timing:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of immediacy and urgency.
* **Contrasting Information:**  The phrase "noncritical but unstable"  introduces a sense of tension. While Robert's condition isn't critical, it's still precarious, leaving the reader wondering if the transplant will arrive in time.

**However, it still lacks some elements to make it truly suspenseful:**

* **Limited Emotional Connection:** We don't know anything about Robert's feelings or the emotions of the surgical team, which would make the situation more impactful.
* **Lack of Foreboding:** There's no hint of potential complications or obstacles that might threaten the success of the transplant.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical staff.
* **Introduce a potential threat:**  Perhaps there's a storm brewing, a traffic jam delaying the helicopter, or a last-minute complication with the organ itself.
* **Build anticipation:**  Focus on the countdown to the surgery, the preparations being made, and the growing tension in the operating room.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Image:** The image of two men carrying a "big blue fridge" containing a "meagerly malfunctioning liver" is unusual and immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Sense of Importance:** The description of the liver as "meagerly malfunctioning"  highlights its fragility and the high stakes involved in the transplant.

**However, it still needs some work to reach higher levels of suspense:**

* **Lack of Context:** We don't know who these men are, their relationship to Robert, or the urgency of the situation.
* **Passive Voice:** The phrase "which stored the meagerly malfunctioning liver" is passive and lacks impact.  
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the tension or anxiety surrounding the transport of this vital organ.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the men's hurried movements, the cold metal of the case.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating the liver is malfunctioning, describe its condition in a way that evokes concern (e.g., "the pale, pulsating organ inside").
* **Create a sense of danger:**  Perhaps the men are facing a time constraint, encountering unexpected obstacles, or dealing with a hostile environment.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The use of "refuse" instead of "refused" and "disinherit" instead of "disregarding" makes the paragraph confusing and detracts from its impact.
* **Lack of Connection:**  The paragraph introduces a seemingly unrelated event (a cleaner mopping the floor) without establishing any clear connection to the main plot (the organ transplant).
* **No Tension:** There's no sense of urgency or danger created by this scene.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Connect the events:**  Find a way to link the cleaner's actions to the transplant. Perhaps the cleaner's negligence creates a hazard that could delay the surgery or endanger Robert.
* **Build tension:**  Describe the cleaner's actions in a way that suggests potential danger (e.g., rushing, spilling water, not paying attention).
* **Hint at consequences:**  Suggest that the cleaner's actions could have serious repercussions for Robert or the surgical team.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Connection:** The paragraph now connects the cleaner's actions to the arrival of the men carrying the liver, suggesting a potential link between the two events.
* **Intriguing Choice:** The decision to use the service stairwell instead of the main entrance adds a layer of mystery and raises questions about why they chose this route.

**However, it still lacks some elements to make it truly suspenseful:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** "Disenchant" doesn't fit the context.  It should likely be "disentangle" or "unloaded."
* **Passive Voice:** "Which they decided to ride down" is passive and lacks impact.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the urgency or tension surrounding the arrival of the liver.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:** Use precise and active language to convey the scene more effectively.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating they decided to use the stairwell, describe their actions and the reasons behind their choice.
* **Build anticipation:**  Focus on the men's movements, the sounds they make, and the atmosphere surrounding their arrival.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Increased Tension:** The paragraph introduces a clear and immediate danger â€“ the case falling down the stairs. This creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Robert's surgery.
* **Active Voice:** The use of active voice ("he slipped," "the case plunged") makes the action more vivid and engaging.

**However, it could be even more suspenseful:**

* **Sensory Details:**  Describe the sound of the case hitting the steps, the men's reactions, the potential for damage to the organ.
* **Emotional Impact:** Show the fear or panic of the men, or hint at the potential consequences of the case falling.
* **Unanswered Questions:**  Leave the reader wondering if the case will be damaged, if the men can retrieve it in time, and what will happen to Robert.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors ("malfunction," "lose," "differ," "leave") which make it difficult to understand and detract from the impact.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The actions of the men are confusing and unclear. What does it mean to "change supervising the case"?

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Action:** The paragraph introduces a new action â€“ a biopsy â€“ which adds a layer of complexity to the situation.
* **Potential for Danger:** The phrase "irresponsible carried out" suggests that the biopsy might not be performed correctly, raising the stakes for Robert's surgery.

**However, it still needs some work to reach higher levels of suspense:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** "Irresponsible carried out" is awkward and grammatically incorrect.
* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know what the surgeon is looking for in the biopsy, or what the potential consequences of a negative result might be.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the tension or anxiety surrounding the biopsy.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:** Use precise and active language to describe the surgeon's actions.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating the surgeon is irresponsible, describe their behavior in a way that suggests carelessness or incompetence.
* **Focus on the stakes:** Emphasize the importance of the biopsy results for Robert's survival.

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The revelation that the organ is unusable is a major setback and raises the stakes for Robert's survival.

* **High Stakes:** The news that the liver is malfunctioning is a major setback, raising the stakes for Robert's survival.
