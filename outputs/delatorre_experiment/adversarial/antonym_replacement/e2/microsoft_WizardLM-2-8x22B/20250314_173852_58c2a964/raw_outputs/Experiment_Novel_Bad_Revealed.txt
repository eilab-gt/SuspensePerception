The paragraph is quite suspenseful, as it sets up a scenario where a young boy's life hangs in the balance, awaiting a liver transplant. The details provided, such as the specific time and place, the critical nature of the boy's condition, and the last-minute arrival of the organ, all contribute to a sense of urgency and tension. The use of the word "unreal" suggests a twist or an unusual aspect to the story, which adds to the suspense. The final sentence hints at an unexpected outcome, leaving the reader curious about the full story and what actually happened, which is a classic element of suspense. However, the suspense is slightly mitigated by the fact that the paragraph concludes with the boy's death, which resolves the primary tension point, albeit in a tragic way.

This paragraph builds suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event crucial to the story: the arrival of the organ via helicopter. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's punctual arrival create a sense of urgency. The reader is aware that Robert Bent's condition is serious, described as "noncritical but unstable," which suggests that time is of the essence and that the transplant is a critical, potentially life-saving procedure. The suspense arises from the anticipation of whether the organ will arrive in time and in suitable condition for the transplant to take place, as well as the question of whether Robert's condition will allow him to endure the surgery. However, the suspense is not at its peak because the paragraph does not present immediate obstacles or complications; it simply sets the stage for what could be a tense sequence of events.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It paints a vivid picture of the urgency and precision required in the situation, with the careful transport of the organ in a blue case at the correct temperature. The mention of the liver being incompatible raises immediate questions and concerns, increasing the tension. The communication between the men, having to shout over the noise of the helicopter and use non-verbal cues, adds to the sense of urgency and the high stakes of the moment. The final sentence introduces a new twist, revealing that the patient is in an "uncritical situation," which is contradictory to the previous information and adds confusion, thereby heightening the suspense. The phrase "they lack no time to win" suggests a race against time, with the implication that there is still a chance to save the patient, but it is unclear whether they will succeed given the incompatible liver. The suspense is sustained by the uncertainty of the outcome and the potential for unforeseen complications.

This paragraph is less suspenseful compared to the others. It focuses on the routine activities of a hospital cleaner, providing a detailed account of his work in the service stairwell. The description of the cleaner's daily routine, his preference for the stairwell over the corridors, and his interaction with the environment create a sense of normalcy rather than tension. While there is a hint of potential danger due to the absence of "wet floor" signs, which could lead to an accident, the overall tone of the paragraph is more about setting a scene and character rather than building suspense. The mundane nature of the job and the cleaner's contentment with his tasks do not suggest an imminent threat or a critical event that would keep the reader on edge. The paragraph does, however, establish a setting and a character that could potentially be involved in a future suspenseful event, given the context of the hospital and the ongoing story about Robert Bent.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It describes the path the men must take to deliver the organ, detailing the layout of the hospital and the decision-making process regarding the best route to the patient. The specific mention of the floors and the discussion about whether to use the stairs or the elevator introduces a sense of urgency, as the men are clearly on a time-sensitive mission. The detail that the patient is on the 6th floor and the debate over the quickest way to reach him adds a layer of tension, as the reader is aware of the critical nature of the task at hand. However, the suspense is somewhat tempered by the calm and practical discussion between the two men, which suggests that they are experienced and in control of the situation. The paragraph sets up a scenario where something could potentially go wrong, but it does not yet present an immediate threat or obstacle that would significantly heighten the suspense.
