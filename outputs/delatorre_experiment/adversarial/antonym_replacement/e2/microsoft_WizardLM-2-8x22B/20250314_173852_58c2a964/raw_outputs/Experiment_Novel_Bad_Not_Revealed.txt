This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a specific event—the landing of a helicopter with the urgently needed organ—that is crucial to the story's outcome. The precise timing (08:57) and the description of Robert's condition as "uncritical but unstable" contribute to the tension, as they suggest a delicate balance between hope and potential disaster. The reader is likely to feel a sense of urgency and concern for the timing and success of the transplant, which is essential for maintaining suspense. However, the suspense level is slightly lower than the previous paragraph because it focuses on a single moment rather than the broader uncertainty of the situation.

This paragraph heightens the suspense by focusing on the careful and precise transport of the liver, emphasizing the importance of the blue case and the temperature control necessary to preserve the organ. The description of the men's actions, the urgency conveyed by their non-verbal communication, and the need to move quickly due to the patient's condition all contribute to a sense of tension and anticipation. The specific details, such as the man pointing to his watch and the doorway, create a vivid scene that pulls the reader into the moment. The fact that the men have not been told about the patient's true condition adds an element of uncertainty, as the reader wonders how this lack of information might impact the events to come.

This paragraph introduces a potential obstacle to the urgent situation previously described—a cleaner mopping the service stairwell without placing warning signs. While the narrative provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine and his lack of awareness regarding the urgency of the situation, the suspense level is relatively lower compared to the previous paragraphs. The reader is aware that the cleaner's actions could potentially interfere with the swift transport of the liver, but the paragraph focuses more on character development and setting than on immediate tension or danger. The mundane nature of the cleaner's job and his unintentional negligence in not placing the warning signs create a sense of foreboding, but the suspense is more subtle and indirect, as the reader anticipates a possible complication in the chain of events rather than an immediate threat.
