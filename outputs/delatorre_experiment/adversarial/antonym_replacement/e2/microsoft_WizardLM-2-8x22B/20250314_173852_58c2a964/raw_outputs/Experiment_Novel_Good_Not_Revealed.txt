This paragraph is less suspenseful compared to the previous ones. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine as he mops the floors of the hospital's service stairwell. The narrative focuses on the mundane aspects of his job and his preference for the stairwell over the corridors due to the lack of interaction with hostile doctors and the absence of bored patients.

However, there are elements that could hint at potential suspense, such as the lack of "wet floor" signs, which could imply an accident waiting to happen. Additionally, the mention of the hospital's layout, including the service stairwell without windows and the positioning of fire extinguishers, provides a backdrop that could become relevant in an emergency situation. The detail that the staff uses elevators or other staircases suggests that this stairwell might be a secluded area, which could be significant if an urgent situation arises where quick and quiet access is needed.

While the paragraph does not directly create a sense of imminent danger or high stakes, it does set the scene for a potential incident related to the cleaner's oversight or the stairwell's isolation. The suspense is subtle and more atmospheric, relying on the reader's anticipation of how these details might become important in the context of the ongoing medical emergency with Robert Bent's liver transplant.
