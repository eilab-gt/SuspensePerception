  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

However, there are a few things that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite short, which means that the suspense is not built up over a long period of time.
2. The cause of Robert's death is revealed quite quickly, which takes away some of the mystery and suspense.
