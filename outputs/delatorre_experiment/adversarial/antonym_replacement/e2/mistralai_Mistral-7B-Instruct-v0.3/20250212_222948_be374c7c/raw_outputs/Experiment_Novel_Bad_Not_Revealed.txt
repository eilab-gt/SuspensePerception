 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "entire medical team" and the "suitable donor." However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Robert's condition or the challenges that the medical team might face during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually," but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ or the helicopter ride, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant.  For example, "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition. As the medical team rushed to unload the organ, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as they knew that every second counted."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds to the suspense by describing the urgency of the situation and the importance of the organ, as well as the actions of the men carrying it. The use of sensory details, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "blue case," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the sense of tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the patient's critical condition and the need to "have no time to lose." Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible. Realizing that he hadn’t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. As they rushed through the hospital corridors, they could hear the beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff, all working frantically to save the life of the young boy."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story and instead provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell. While the paragraph is well-written and provides a sense of normalcy, it does not add to the tension or build anticipation for the events that are about to unfold. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to focus more on the hospital environment and the sense of urgency that is building. For example, "Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner hurriedly finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, knowing that something important was about to happen in the hospital. The service stairwell was usually quiet and empty, but today there was a sense of tension in the air. The cleaner, who preferred the more social corridors where he could chat with the doctors and patients, quickly gathered his things and took the lift back down to the ground floor, eager to start his typical working day." This paragraph sets the stage for the suspenseful events that are about to occur and creates a sense of unease in the hospital environment.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides more details about the hospital environment and the route that the men are taking to deliver the organ, which adds to the sense of urgency and tension. The use of specific details, such as the "helipad exit," "service stairwell," and "central archives," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the sense of urgency. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the patient's location on the 6th floor and the need to avoid the elevator. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital’s secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor. It’s not worth taking the lift,” he said, realising his colleague’s intention. “By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it’ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.” His colleague nodded, knowing that every second counted. As they rushed down the service stairwell, they could hear the beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff, all working frantically to save the life of the young boy."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the unexpected event of the man slipping on the stairs and the case rolling down. The use of sensory details, such as the "noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the sense of urgency. The paragraph also creates a sense of danger and potential disaster, as the case could be damaged or the organ could be lost. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the case rolling down the stairs or the impact it might have on the transplant. For example, "His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs, bouncing and spinning over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror, knowing that every second counted and that the organ inside the case was their only hope for saving the young boy's life."  This paragraph adds more details about the consequences of the case rolling down the stairs and the impact it might have on the transplant, which increases the suspense.

The use of the phrase "We don’t know if it’s been damaged" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "complex network of corridors" that the man must navigate to reach the transplant department. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the need to "alert the medical team." Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of a damaged organ or the impact it might have on the transplant. For example, "Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other with concern. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors, his heart pounding in his chest as he knew that every second counted. He reached the reception desk in the transplant department, where the medical team was alerted. The doctor on duty looked at the case with a mixture of relief and concern, knowing that the organ inside was their only hope for saving the young boy's life."  This paragraph adds more details about the consequences of a damaged organ and the impact it might have on the transplant, which increases the suspense.  Additionally, the paragraph could also provide more details about the doctor's reaction and the urgency of the situation, such as "The doctor on duty looked at the case with a mixture of relief and concern, knowing that the organ inside was their only hope for saving the young boy's life.

The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the doctors' arrival. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the doctors' reactions or the condition of the liver. For example, "Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell, their footsteps echoing through the empty corridors. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. “Move away, please,” asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case, his face a mask of concentration. The man hesitated for a moment, then reluctantly moved away, his eyes fixed on the case as the doctors carefully opened it. The liver inside was a deep red, but it was still beating, pulsing with life. The doctors worked quickly, their hands moving with precision as they prepared to transplant it into the young boy."  This paragraph adds more details about the doctors' reactions and the condition of the liver, which increases the suspense.

For example, "He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look, the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The doctor's face was a mask of concern, and the medical team around him was silent as they watched him. The organ inside the case was their only hope for saving the young boy's life, and the rupture of the fridge was a devastating blow. The doctor quickly called for backup, knowing that they needed to act fast to save the organ and the boy's life."
