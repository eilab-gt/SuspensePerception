 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a tense situation with an imminent liver transplant, a critical patient, and the uncertainty of a suitable donor. The use of phrases like "they differ not sure if Robert would survive the wait" and "what dematerialize" adds to the suspense and intrigue. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the events leading up to the transplant and the stakes involved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the helicopter landing punctually, but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ and its importance, or it could hint at potential complications or obstacles that could arise during the transplant. 2 At 08: 57, the helicopter carrying the long-awaited liver organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where eight-year-old Robert Bent lay in a noncritical but unstable condition. The medical team rushed to the roof, their hearts pounding with anticipation and hope. But as they prepared to transfer the organ to Robert, they realized that the organ was not a perfect match. The clock was ticking, and they had to act fast to find a suitable replacement before it was too late.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The use of the phrase "meagerly malfunctioning liver" adds a sense of urgency and uncertainty, and the image of the men carrying a large blue fridge creates a visual and tangible element that helps to ground the reader in the scene. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the condition of the liver and the potential consequences of using it for the transplant. 3 Two men rose from the helicopter, one of whom carried a large blue fridge, in the shape of a case, which stored the meagerly malfunctioning liver. The medical team watched anxiously as the men carefully transferred the organ from the fridge to a cart, their hands shaking with anticipation and fear. They knew that this organ was their last hope for Robert, but they also knew that it was far from perfect. The clock was ticking, and they had to act fast to prepare Robert for the transplant before the organ deteriorated any further.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph does not add much to the overall suspense of the story and seems to be a tangential detail that does not contribute to the tension or drama. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to focus more on the medical team's preparations for the transplant or the condition of Robert. 4 Minutes earlier, the cleaner began mopping the floor of the service stairwell, but failed to display the "dry floor" sign.

But as they entered the room, they saw that the floor was still wet from the cleaner's mopping. The team quickly set to work drying the floor with towels, but they knew that every second they wasted could be a second too many for Robert. 5/9

The use of the phrase "disenchant" adds a sense of mystery and intrigue, and the image of the men taking an unconventional route to the operating room creates a visual and tangible element that helps to ground the reader in the scene. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about why the men chose to take the service stairwell or if it hinted at potential obstacles or complications that could arise during their descent. 5 The two men disenchanted the liver arrived on the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell, which they decided to ride down.
