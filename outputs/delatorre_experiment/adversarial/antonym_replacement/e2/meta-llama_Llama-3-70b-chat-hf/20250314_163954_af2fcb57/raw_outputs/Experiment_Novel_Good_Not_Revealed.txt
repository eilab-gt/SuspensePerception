I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a life-or-death situation (a liver transplant) and a ticking clock (the wait for the organ to arrive).
* The use of words like "uncritical" and "succumb" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The phrase "This differ the story of what dematerialise" is intriguing and hints that something unexpected and potentially dramatic is about to happen.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by:

* The awkward and ungrammatical sentence structure, which can be distracting and take the reader out of the story.
* The lack of emotional connection to the protagonist, Robert. We're told he's an 8-year-old boy, but we don't know much about him or his situation beyond that.
* The somewhat vague hint at what's to come. While the phrase "what dematerialise" is intriguing, it's not entirely clear what it means or what kind of suspenseful event is being hinted at.

Overall, the paragraph has some elements of suspense, but could be more effective with some revisions to sentence structure, character development, and clearer hints at what's to come.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation by mentioning the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, which is a crucial element in Robert's life-or-death situation.
* The use of a specific time ("08:57") adds a sense of realism and creates a sense of urgency.
* The phrase "noncritical but unstable condition" suggests that Robert's situation is precarious and could take a turn for the worse at any moment.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat limited by:

* The lack of emotional connection to Robert. We're still not getting a sense of who he is or what's at stake beyond his medical condition.
* The fact that the helicopter lands "punctually" suggests that everything is going according to plan, which reduces the sense of tension or uncertainty.
* The sentence is fairly straightforward and lacks any real surprises or twists. We're not left wondering what will happen next or what obstacles might arise.

Overall, the paragraph is setting the stage for a potentially suspenseful scene, but it's not yet creating a strong sense of tension or uncertainty.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a vivid and immersive scene, with sensory details like the whirlwind of the spinning blades and the men's hair being blown back. This helps to build tension and create a sense of urgency.
* The introduction of the blue case containing the liver adds an element of high stakes, and the fact that it's "meagerly malfunctioning" raises the tension and creates a sense of uncertainty.
* The use of cryptic language, such as "the same whisper something audible" and "an invisible nod", creates a sense of mystery and intrigue.
* The men's actions, such as pointing at their watches and the doorway, suggest that they're in a hurry and that time is of the essence. This creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The final sentence, "During the journey they refuse differ told that the patient differ in a uncritical situation and they refuse no time to find", is particularly effective in creating suspense. The use of the word "refuse" implies a sense of urgency and desperation, and the fact that they're not being told about the patient's situation creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat limited by:

* The awkward and ungrammatical sentence structure, which can be distracting and take the reader out of the story.
* The lack of emotional connection to Robert, the patient. While we're getting a sense of urgency and high stakes, we're still not getting a sense of who Robert is or what's at stake beyond his medical condition.

Overall, the paragraph is doing a great job of creating a sense of tension and urgency, and is effectively building suspense. With some revisions to sentence structure and character development, it could be even more effective.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph is primarily focused on describing the daily routine of a cleaner in a hospital, which is a mundane and ordinary task. There's no sense of urgency, danger, or high stakes.
* The language used is straightforward and lacks any sense of tension or foreboding. The cleaner is described as whistling and going about his work in a routine manner.
* The details about the service stairwell, such as the lack of windows and the red fire extinguishers, are interesting but don't contribute to any sense of suspense.
* The paragraph is more focused on creating a sense of atmosphere and setting than on building tension or suspense.

The only potential element of suspense is the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to put up "dry floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident or incident. However, this is a relatively minor detail and doesn't create a strong sense of tension or uncertainty.

Overall, this paragraph is more focused on setting the scene and establishing the cleaner's routine than on building suspense. It's a slow-burning and atmospheric passage, but it doesn't create a strong sense of tension or anticipation.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The use of words like "unhitch" and "bound hand" adds a sense of physicality and tension to the scene.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat limited by:

* The lack of emotional connection to the patient, Robert. While we're getting a sense of urgency and tension, we're still not getting a sense of who Robert is or what's at stake beyond his medical condition.
* The fact that the men's conversation is fairly straightforward and lacks any real surprises or twists. We're not left wondering what will happen next or what obstacles might arise.

Overall, the paragraph is doing a great job of creating a sense of tension and urgency, and is effectively building suspense. With some revisions to character development and plot twists, it could be even more effective.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat limited by:

* The fact that the tension is somewhat diffused by the men's cautious and methodical approach to dealing with the situation. While there is still a sense of uncertainty, the men's actions are relatively calm and controlled.
* The lack of any real surprises or twists in the paragraph. While the situation is still tense and uncertain, the men's actions are relatively predictable and don't add any new layers of complexity to the story.

Overall, the paragraph is still very suspenseful and effectively builds on the tension created in the previous paragraph. However, it could be even more effective with some additional surprises or twists to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
