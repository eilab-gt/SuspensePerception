I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful scenario: a young boy is waiting for a liver transplant, and his situation is critical. The use of words like "imminent" and "noncritical" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will Robert receive the transplant in time?" and "Will he survive?"

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is hindered by several factors:

* The writing is somewhat clumsy and contains errors (e.g., "differ" instead of "about to", "unready" instead of "unprepared", "lack differ abolish" instead of "a suitable donor had not been found"). This distracts from the narrative and reduces tension.
* The paragraph is overly expository, with too much telling and not enough showing. Instead of being dropped into the scene, the reader is given a dry, factual account of the events leading up to the story.
* The final sentence, "This differ the story of what dematerialise," is confusing and doesn't effectively create suspense. It's unclear what "dematerialise" means in this context, and the sentence doesn't raise any clear questions or create a sense of anticipation.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could be improved with more descriptive language, a clearer narrative, and a more effective cliffhanger ending.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes by introducing the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, which is a critical element in Robert's survival. The use of a specific time ("08:57") adds a sense of realism and creates a sense of ticking clock, which can contribute to suspense.

The phrase "punctually on the roof of the hospital" creates a sense of relief, but this is quickly tempered by the description of Robert's condition as "uncritical but unstable". This contrast between the timely arrival of the organ and Robert's precarious health creates tension and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the organ arrive in time to save Robert?" and "What does 'unstable' mean for Robert's chances of survival?"

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is still limited by the same issues as the previous paragraph: the writing is somewhat clumsy, with errors such as "differ" instead of "was", and the sentence structure is simple and lacks descriptive language. Additionally, the paragraph is still quite short and doesn't build up to a more dramatic or cliffhanger-like ending.

Overall, while the paragraph creates some suspense, it could be improved with more descriptive language, varied sentence structure, and a more dramatic conclusion.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a vivid and intense scene, with the helicopter's rotors still spinning and the two men emerging from the aircraft amidst the whirlwind. The use of sensory details like "heads down and hair conserve by the whirlwind" and "the noise of the blades" immerses the reader in the scene and creates a sense of urgency.

The introduction of the blue case containing the liver raises the stakes and creates tension, especially with the added detail that it's "meagerly malfunctioning". This creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the liver be usable?" and "What will happen if it's not?"

The interaction between the two men is also suspenseful, as they communicate in a hushed tone and use gestures to convey urgency. The fact that they're in a hurry and "abstain no time to break even" creates a sense of pressure and raises the tension.

The only thing holding me back from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is the continued presence of errors and awkward phrasing, such as "differ no longer unbend", "differ storing", "lack differ told", and "abstain no time to break even". These errors distract from the narrative and make it harder to fully immerse oneself in the scene.

Despite these issues, the paragraph does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of urgency, making it a compelling and suspenseful read.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph is primarily focused on describing the daily routine of a hospital cleaner, which is a mundane and ordinary task. The description of the service stairwell, the cleaner's job, and his habits is detailed but lacks any sense of tension, urgency, or conflict. The tone is more observational and matter-of-fact, which doesn't create any suspense or anticipation.

The only potential element of suspense is the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to put up "dry floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident or incident. However, this is not developed or emphasized in the paragraph, and the tone remains casual and uneventful.

The paragraph's focus on the cleaner's routine and the hospital's layout makes it feel more like a descriptive passage or a character sketch rather than a suspenseful scene. The writing is clear and easy to follow, but it doesn't create any sense of tension or anticipation, making it a relatively low-suspense paragraph.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the route that the man carrying the liver case needs to take to reach the patient. The use of specific details about the hospital's layout, such as the metal ramp, service stairwell, and primary corridors, creates a sense of realism and immersion.

The interaction between the two men is also suspenseful, as they discuss the best way to reach the patient. The man carrying the case is hesitant to take the lift, and his colleague's suggestion to take the stairs instead raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The phrase "it's not worth obviate the lift" implies that time is of the essence, and that every minute counts.

The paragraph also creates a sense of anticipation by setting up a potential obstacle or challenge. The reader is left wondering if the men will make it to the patient in time, and if they will encounter any difficulties along the way.

The only thing holding me back from giving this paragraph a higher rating is that the suspense is still somewhat muted. The tone is more matter-of-fact than intense, and the language is not particularly evocative or dramatic. Additionally, the paragraph is still somewhat marred by errors and awkward phrasing, such as "differ a metal ramp", "malfunction to drop out the corridor", and "refuse abstain short than ride down two floors". These errors distract from the narrative and make it harder to fully immerse oneself in the scene.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a highly suspenseful and intense scene, with the man's foot slipping on the second step and causing him to lose his balance. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "untwist his ankle", "reach out to grab hold of the bannister", and "disallow go of the case", creates a sense of urgency and chaos.

The image of the case unwinding down the stairs, spinning over on every step, and making a noise like "a bunch of tight keys differ shaken in a bag" is particularly evocative and suspenseful. The use of onomatopoeia ("break a noise") adds to the sense of immediacy and intensity.

The reaction of the two men, who "let go of their breath" and watch in horror, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering if the case will survive the fall, and if the liver inside will be damaged or destroyed.

The only thing holding me back from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the continued presence of errors and awkward phrasing, such as "divest it on the second step", "differ already level", "disallow go of the case", and "devoice like a bunch of tight keys differ shaken in a bag". These errors distract from the narrative and make it harder to fully immerse oneself in the scene. However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is still high, and the errors do not completely detract from the tension and urgency of the scene.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of relief that the case has finally reached the bottom of the stairs, but this relief is short-lived as the two men are faced with the uncertainty of whether the liver has been damaged. The use of phrases like "Don't!" and "We don't ignore if it's differ damaged" creates a sense of urgency and caution, and the reader is left wondering if the liver is still viable.

The decision to call the doctors and the instruction to "depart there watching it, in case anyone go" adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The use of words like "ill" and "refuse care not to slip as ill" creates a sense of danger and risk, and the reader is left wondering if the man will make it to the transplant department in time.

The paragraph's pace is also well-handled, with a sense of urgency and haste as the man rushes to alert the surgical team. The use of phrases like "Without conserve any time" and "ride slowly through the simple network of corridors" creates a sense of tension and anticipation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

The only thing holding me back from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the continued presence of errors and awkward phrasing, such as "differ kneeling down", "lack differ in charge", "differ damaged", and "refuse care not to slip as ill". These errors distract from the narrative and make it harder to fully immerse oneself in the scene. However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is still high, and the errors do not completely detract from the tension and urgency of the scene.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a highly suspenseful and intense scene, with the colleague lying beside the case, trying to forget about the possibility that the liver has been damaged. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "let a firm hold on the bannister", "lie beside the case", and "bearing his weight on his uninjured foot", creates a sense of urgency and tension.

The introduction of the colleague's superstition that the condition of the liver depends on his own suffering adds a layer of psychological complexity to the scene, and raises the stakes even higher. The reader is left wondering if the liver is still viable, and if the colleague's sacrifice will be enough to save the patient.

The arrival of the doctors is expertly handled, with the use of words like "delay" and "disappear" creating a sense of suddenness and urgency. The doctor's instruction to "Move away, please" adds to the sense of tension and anticipation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.
