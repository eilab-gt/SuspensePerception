I would rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors make it difficult to follow the story and create any sense of tension. 
* **Lack of Vivid Language:** The writing is very dry and lacks descriptive language that could evoke emotion or create a sense of urgency.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("differ all unready," "differ now awaiting") makes the writing feel distant and unemotional.
* **Unclear Stakes:** While we know Robert is sick and needs a transplant, the paragraph doesn't effectively convey the severity of his condition or the potential consequences if the transplant doesn't happen.

**To improve the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Be rewritten with correct grammar and punctuation.**
* **Use more vivid language to describe Robert's condition, the atmosphere in the hospital, and the emotions of the surgical team.**
* **Employ active voice to make the writing more direct and engaging.**
* **Clearly establish the stakes by highlighting the urgency of the situation and the potential consequences of failure.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Introduction of Time Pressure:** The specific time "08:57" and the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually" create a sense of urgency and a ticking clock.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the organ's arrival with Robert's "noncritical but unstable" condition hints at potential complications and raises the stakes.

**However:**

* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is quite brief and lacks descriptive details that could further heighten the suspense. We don't know anything about the atmosphere, the characters' reactions, or the potential obstacles that might arise.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of "differ" again makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Expand on the scene:** Describe the helicopter landing, the team's reaction, and Robert's condition in more detail.
* **Use active voice:**  "Robert lay in a noncritical but unstable condition" is more impactful than "Robert differ in a noncritical but unstable condition."
* **Hint at potential problems:**  Introduce a subtle element of doubt or foreshadowing to keep the reader guessing.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

**Here's why:**

* **Intriguing Details:** The description of the men battling the helicopter wind, the mention of the "incompatible liver," and the whispered communication create a sense of mystery and urgency.
* **Sense of Danger:** The phrase "meagerly malfunctioning" suggests a potential problem with the organ, raising the stakes.
* **Time Pressure:** The emphasis on time ("pointed at the watch," "no time to find") adds to the suspense.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The persistent grammatical errors ("differ," "unbend," "conserve") continue to distract from the narrative and make it harder to fully engage with the suspense.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The meaning of some phrases is unclear ("the incompatible liver," "refuse differ told"). This ambiguity can be frustrating for the reader.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("differ storing," "differ told") weakens the impact of the writing.

**To enhance the suspense:**

* **Correct the grammatical errors:** This will make the writing clearer and more engaging.
* **Clarify ambiguous phrases:** Ensure the meaning is clear and understandable.
* **Use active voice:** Make the writing more direct and impactful.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that there's no time, describe the frantic pace and the characters' actions that convey the urgency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale.

**Here's why:**

* **Mundane Setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of the stairwell create a sense of ordinariness, which works against suspense.
* **Lack of Tension:** There's no immediate threat or danger presented. The cleaner's job seems tedious but not inherently suspenseful.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("refuse begin," "abstain stop," "differ never positioned") makes the writing feel distant and uneventful.

**However:**

* **Potential for Contrast:** The paragraph establishes a sense of normalcy that could be disrupted by a sudden event, creating a contrast that might heighten suspense later on.
* **Foreshadowing:** The mention of the "dry floor" warning signs not being used could subtly foreshadow a potential accident or danger.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a Threat:** Hint at a potential danger or conflict that could arise in the stairwell.
* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds, smells, and sights of the stairwell in a way that creates a more immersive and potentially unsettling atmosphere.
* **Use Active Voice:** Make the writing more direct and engaging by using active voice.
* **Build Tension Gradually:** Slowly introduce elements that suggest something is amiss, keeping the reader guessing about what might happen next.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The persistent grammatical errors ("differ," "unhitch," "abstain") continue to detract from the overall impact.
* **Lack of Sensory Detail:** The paragraph could be more suspenseful with more vivid descriptions of the environment and the characters' emotions.

**To enhance the suspense:**

* **Correct the grammatical errors:** This will make the writing clearer and more engaging.
* **Add Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds, smells, and sights of the corridor to create a more immersive experience.
* **Show the Characters' Emotions:** Convey the men's anxiety, determination, or fear through their actions and expressions.
