I would rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors make it difficult to follow the story and create any sense of tension. 
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("differ place," "differ unready," "differ abolish") distances the reader from the action and reduces the emotional impact.
* **Lack of Vivid Language:** The writing lacks sensory details and strong verbs that could evoke suspense.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammar:**  Clear and concise language is essential for building suspense.
* **Use active voice:**  Active voice makes the writing more direct and engaging.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital environment.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** The specific time "08:57" and the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually" create a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the organ's arrival with Robert's "uncritical but unstable condition" hints at the precariousness of the situation.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Correct the grammar and improve clarity.**

**Here's why:**

* **Mundane Setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of the stairwell create a sense of ordinariness, which works against suspense.
