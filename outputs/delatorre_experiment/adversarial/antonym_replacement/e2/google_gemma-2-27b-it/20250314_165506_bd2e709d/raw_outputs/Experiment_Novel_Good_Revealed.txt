* **Info Dump:** The paragraph presents a lot of information in a straightforward manner, rather than gradually revealing details to keep the reader guessing.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammar and punctuation.**
* **Use more active voice and vivid language.**
* **Focus on Robert's perspective and emotions.**
* **Build tension by hinting at the potential complications and the urgency of the situation.**
* **Delay revealing the outcome until the end of the paragraph.**
