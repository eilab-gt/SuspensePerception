 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the mention of the young patient's critical condition, it lacks the build-up and context necessary to create a strong sense of suspense. The paragraph simply states that the helicopter carrying the organ arrived on time, without providing any information about the challenges or obstacles that the medical team might have faced in obtaining the organ or performing the transplant. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could include more details about the risks and uncertainties involved in the procedure, and how the arrival of the organ affects the outcome.

 I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively creates a sense of urgency and tension with the use of vivid and specific details, such as the sound of the helicopter blades and the temperature of the liver.

 I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph provides some interesting details about the cleaner's daily routine, it does not create any sense of tension or urgency.
