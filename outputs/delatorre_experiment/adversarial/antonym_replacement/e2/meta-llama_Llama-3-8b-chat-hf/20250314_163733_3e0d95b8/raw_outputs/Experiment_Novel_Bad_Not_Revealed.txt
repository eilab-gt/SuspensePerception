I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is written in a very formal and dry tone, which makes it difficult to create a sense of tension or suspense. The use of phrases such as "differ" instead of "said" or "was" also makes the text sound awkward and unnatural, which further detracts from its ability to build suspense.

Additionally, the paragraph doesn't really provide any hints or clues about what might happen next, which is a key element of suspense. The reader is simply presented with a series of facts and events without any sense of urgency or danger. Overall, the paragraph is more informative than suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation by describing the arrival of the organ, which is a crucial moment in the story. The use of precise timing ("08:57") adds to the sense of urgency and importance.
