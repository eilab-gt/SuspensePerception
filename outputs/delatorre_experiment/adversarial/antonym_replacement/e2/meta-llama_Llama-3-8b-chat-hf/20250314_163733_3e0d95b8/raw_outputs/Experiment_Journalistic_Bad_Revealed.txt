I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of the main character, Robert Bent, and the situation he's in (awaiting a liver transplant) is somewhat suspenseful, as it creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen to him.
* The twist that the organ is damaged and the transplant can't be performed is a surprise, which adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph doesn't build up to this twist very well, and it's not particularly surprising given the context.
* The use of phrases like "differ" and "dematerialise" is awkward and unclear, which detracts from the overall impact of the paragraph.
* The paragraph doesn't create a sense of tension or emotional investment in the reader, which is important for suspense to be effective.

Overall, while the paragraph has some suspenseful elements, it's not particularly effective at building tension or creating a sense of uncertainty, which are key elements of suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation by setting a specific time (08:57) and describing the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ.

* The image of two men emerging from the helicopter is already somewhat ominous, as it implies that something important is about to happen.
* The fact that one of them is carrying a large blue fridge, which is described as a "case" that stored the "meagerly malfunctioning liver", is a surprise and raises questions about what's going on.

* The image of a liver being transported in a fridge is also somewhat unsettling, as it implies that the organ is fragile and that there may be risks involved in the transplant.
