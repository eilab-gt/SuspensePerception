I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a serious and somber tone, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The use of specific dates and times adds a sense of realism and urgency to the story.
* The description of Robert's critical condition and the uncertainty surrounding the transplant creates tension and suspense.
* The sudden twist at the end, where Robert dies due to the damaged organ, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that adds to the suspense.
