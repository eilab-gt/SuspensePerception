I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and unusual context, which grabs the reader's attention. The use of a real hospital and a specific date adds to the sense of realism.
* The introduction of a critical medical situation, with a child's life hanging in the balance, creates tension and raises questions in the reader's mind.
* The use of phrases like "refuse to place" and "differ all unready" creates a sense of uncertainty and foreboding.
* The mention of a suitable donor being found, but the team not being sure if the child will survive the wait, adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

However, the paragraph falls short of being "very suspensful" (9 out of 9) because:

* The language is quite formal and clinical, which may make it harder for some readers to become fully invested in the story.
* The paragraph is quite short and doesn't have much build-up or foreshadowing, which are important elements of suspense.
* The ending, "This is the story of what dematerialize," is quite ambiguous and doesn't provide much of a payoff or a sense of resolution, which may leave some readers feeling unsatisfied.

* The ending is quite abrupt and doesn't provide much of a payoff or a sense of resolution, which may leave some readers feeling unsatisfied.

Overall, this paragraph is more of a "setup" paragraph, providing some context and setting the stage for what's to come, rather than a suspenseful moment in and of itself.

* The fact that the liver is malfunctioning creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next.

* The ending is still quite abrupt and doesn't provide much of a payoff or a sense of resolution, which may leave some readers feeling unsatisfied.

Overall, this paragraph is more of a "twist" paragraph, providing a unexpected and intriguing image that raises questions and creates tension, rather than a suspenseful moment in and of itself.

* The paragraph doesn't provide any sense of urgency, danger, or uncertainty, which are all important elements of suspense.

Overall, this paragraph is quite boring and doesn't create much of a sense of tension or suspense. It's more of a "background" paragraph that provides some context, but doesn't add much to the story.

* The fact that the two men decide to ride down the stairwell instead of taking the elevator creates a sense of tension and raises questions in the reader's mind.
* The use of the word "disenchant" to describe the liver is an interesting choice, as it implies that something is not quite right with the organ.
