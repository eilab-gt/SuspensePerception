I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "will differ,"  incorrect punctuation) distract the reader and make it harder to get invested in the story.
* **Lack of Tension:** While the situation (a child awaiting a life-saving transplant) has inherent potential for suspense, the paragraph doesn't build any real tension.  We're told Robert's situation is "noncritical," which undermines the sense of urgency.
* **Vague Language:** Phrases like "what dematerialize" are confusing and don't create a clear sense of what's at stake.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear and correct language is essential for engaging the reader.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's emotions, the ticking clock, etc. to create a more immersive experience.
* **Raise the stakes:**  Highlight the risks involved in the transplant and the potential consequences if it fails.
* **Create a sense of mystery:**  Hint at something unexpected or unknown that might happen.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Timing:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of immediacy and urgency.
* **Contrasting Information:**  The phrase "noncritical but unstable"  introduces a sense of tension. While Robert's condition isn't critical, it's still precarious, leaving the reader wondering if the transplant will arrive in time.

**However, it still lacks some elements to make it truly suspenseful:**

* **Limited Emotional Connection:** We don't know anything about Robert's feelings or the emotions of the surgical team, which would make the situation more impactful.
* **Lack of Foreboding:** There's no hint of potential complications or obstacles that might threaten the success of the transplant.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical staff.
* **Introduce a potential threat:**  Perhaps there's a storm brewing, a traffic jam delaying the transport, or a last-minute complication with the organ itself.
* **Build anticipation:**  Focus on the countdown to the surgery, the preparations being made, and the growing tension in the operating room.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Image:** The image of two men carrying a "big blue fridge" containing a "meagerly malfunctioning liver" is unusual and immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Sense of Importance:** The description of the liver as "meagerly malfunctioning"  highlights its fragility and the high stakes involved in the transplant.

**However, it still needs some work to reach higher levels of suspense:**

* **Lack of Context:** We don't know who these men are, their relationship to Robert, or the urgency of the situation.
* **Passive Voice:** The phrase "which stored the meagerly malfunctioning liver" is passive and lacks impact.  
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the tension or anxiety surrounding the transport of this vital organ.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the men's hurried movements, the cold metal of the case.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating the liver is malfunctioning, describe its condition in a way that evokes concern (e.g., "the pale, pulsating organ inside").
* **Create a sense of danger:**  Perhaps the men are facing a time constraint, encountering unexpected obstacles, or dealing with a hostile environment.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Confusing Language:** The use of "refuse" and "disinherit" is grammatically incorrect and creates confusion. 
* **Lack of Connection:**  The paragraph focuses on a seemingly unrelated event (a cleaner mopping the floor) and doesn't establish any clear connection to the main plot (the organ transplant).
* **No Tension:** There's no sense of urgency or danger created by this scene.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Rewrite with clear, concise language:**  Replace the confusing words with appropriate synonyms.
* **Establish a connection:**  Explain how the cleaner's actions might impact the transplant or create a potential obstacle.
* **Introduce a threat:** Perhaps the wet floor poses a risk to someone rushing to the operating room, or the cleaner accidentally spills something crucial.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Connection:** The paragraph now directly links the cleaner's actions to the arrival of the men carrying the liver.
* **Intriguing Choice:** The decision to use the service stairwell instead of the main entrance adds a layer of mystery and suggests a possible reason for secrecy or urgency.

**However, it still lacks some elements to make it truly suspenseful:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** "Disenchant" is not the right word choice here. It should be something like "discharged" or "delivered."
* **Passive Voice:** "The liver arrive the roof" is grammatically incorrect and lacks impact.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the tension or anxiety surrounding the transport of the liver.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Rewrite with clear, active language:**  For example, "The two men carried the liver up to the roof through the service stairwell door."
* **Show, don't tell:** Describe the men's expressions, their hurried movements, the weight of the case, etc.
* **Hint at a potential threat:**  Perhaps the stairwell is dark and narrow, or they hear footsteps approaching.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Action and Stakes:** The sudden slip and the case plunging upward create a clear moment of danger and raise the stakes for the transplant.
* **Visual Impact:** The image of the case flying upward is unexpected and creates a sense of chaos.

**However, it could be even more suspenseful:**

* **Sensory Details:**  Describe the sound of the case hitting the steps, the men's startled reactions, the feeling of dread as the case ascends.
* **Emotional Connection:**  Show the men's fear or desperation as they try to recover the case.
* **Unanswered Questions:**  Leave the reader wondering if the liver will be damaged, if the men can retrieve it, and what the consequences will be.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors ("malfunction," "lose," "differ") which make it difficult to understand and detract from the impact.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The actions of the men are confusing and the sentence structure is convoluted. It's unclear what happens to the case and how the doctors react.
* **Missed Opportunity:** The situation has the potential to be very suspenseful (a vital organ falling, a race against time), but the writing fails to capitalize on it.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Rewrite with clear, concise language:**  Use active verbs and avoid unnecessary jargon.
* **Focus on the action:** Describe the men's movements, the sound of the case hitting the steps, the urgency of their actions.
* **Build tension:**  Show the doctors' reactions, the ticking clock, the potential consequences of the delay.

* **Hint at potential problems:**  Perhaps they encounter an obstacle on their way, or there's a sense that time is running out.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Continuing the Stakes:** The paragraph continues to build on the tension established in the previous one by showing the liver is being examined.
* **Intriguing Action:** The biopsy adds a sense of urgency and raises the question of whether the liver is salvageable.

**However, it could be more suspenseful:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** "Irresponsible" doesn't fit the context.  It should be something like "quickly" or "diligently."
* **Lack of Detail:** We don't know how the biopsy is going, what the surgeon is thinking, or how long it takes.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel the weight of the situation for the doctors or for Robert.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Describe the surgeon's movements, the tension in the lab, the anticipation as they wait for the results.
* **Create a sense of uncertainty:**  Hint at potential complications or unexpected findings from the biopsy.
* **Focus on the ticking clock:**  Emphasize the time pressure to make a decision about the transplant.
