I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract from the potential suspense.  The writing is confusing and makes it hard to follow the story.
* **Lack of Tension Building:**  While the situation described (a child needing a transplant) has inherent tension, the paragraph doesn't build it effectively.  There are no cliffhangers, rising action, or vivid descriptions to keep the reader on edge.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical and the transplant is risky, but it doesn't show us through sensory details or emotional reactions.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear and concise writing is essential for building suspense.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's fear, the team's anxiety.
* **Use active voice:**  "The surgical team verified" is passive.  Try "The surgical team discovered" for a more impactful sentence.
* **Create a cliffhanger:**  End the paragraph on a note that leaves the reader wanting more. For example, you could end with a line like, "But as the surgeon made the final incision, a chilling realization washed over him..."

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Clarity:** The grammar is much better than the previous paragraph, making it easier to follow.
* **Time Element:** The specific time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Contrasting Information:** The juxtaposition of the helicopter's punctuality with Robert's critical condition creates a slight tension.

**However, it still lacks:**

* **Emotional Impact:** We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's desperation.
* **Rising Action:** There's no build-up to a climax or a sense of something dangerous about to happen.
* **Intriguing Details:** The paragraph is quite bare-bones.  What kind of organ is it? What are the risks involved?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying Robert is "uncritical but unstable," describe his labored breathing, the beeping of machines, or the worried faces of the nurses.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the whirring of the helicopter blades, the smell of antiseptic in the air, the tense silence in the operating room.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Perhaps the helicopter encounters bad weather, or there's a last-minute problem with the organ.
