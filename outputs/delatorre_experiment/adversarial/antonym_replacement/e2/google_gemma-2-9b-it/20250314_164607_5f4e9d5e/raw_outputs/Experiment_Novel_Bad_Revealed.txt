I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "were,"  "abstain" instead of "occur," etc.) distract from the potential suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Pacing:** The paragraph tells us a lot of information upfront (the date, the location, the boy's name, the situation) without building any real tension. 
* **Flat Emotional Impact:**  While the situation is clearly serious, the writing doesn't effectively convey the emotional weight of the situation. We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's desperation.
* **Unsatisfying Ending:** The phrase "This differ the story of what dematerialise" is confusing and anticlimactic. It doesn't leave the reader wanting to know more.

**To improve the suspensefulness, the writer could:**

* **Focus on a specific moment:** Instead of summarizing the entire day, zoom in on a crucial scene, like the moment the donor organ arrives or when Robert's condition worsens.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital to create a more immersive experience.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that Robert is in danger, describe his labored breathing or his pale skin.
* **Build tension gradually:**  Use foreshadowing and cliffhangers to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
* **End with a question or a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a lingering sense of uncertainty.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying a vital organ immediately creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Time Stamp:** The specific time (08:57) adds a sense of immediacy and heightens the anticipation.
* **Contrasting Information:** The statement that Robert is "in a noncritical but unstable condition" creates a sense of precariousness and raises the stakes.

**However, it lacks some key elements for higher suspense:**

* **Limited Emotional Impact:** We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's desperation.
* **Lack of Foreshadowing:** There's no hint of potential complications or obstacles.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The paragraph ends rather abruptly, leaving the reader wanting more.

**To increase the suspense, the writer could:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical staff.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter blades, the smell of antiseptic in the air, or the frantic activity in the hospital.
* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps there's a delay in getting the organ to Robert, or a complication arises during the surgery.
* **End with a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader wondering if the transplant will be successful.

* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("the organ differ storing," "they abstain differ told") makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.
