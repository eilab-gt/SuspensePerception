I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "will differ,"  "lack differ abolish" etc.) distract from the potential suspense and make the writing feel clunky.
* **Lack of Clear Stakes:** While we understand Robert needs a liver transplant, the paragraph doesn't effectively convey the urgency or danger of his situation.  "Noncritical" undermines the sense of impending doom.
* **Vague Threat:** The phrase "what dematerialise" is confusing and doesn't create a clear sense of what might go wrong.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear, concise writing is essential for building suspense.
* **Raise the stakes:** Emphasize the severity of Robert's condition and the potential consequences of the wait.
* **Create a tangible threat:**  Instead of "what dematerialise," hint at a specific danger, like complications during surgery or a sudden change in Robert's health.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Timing:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of immediacy and build anticipation.
* **Contrasting Information:** The juxtaposition of "punctually" and "unstable condition" adds a layer of tension.  We know the organ arrived on time, but Robert's condition is precarious.

**However, it still lacks some key elements for higher suspense:**

* **Limited Stakes:** We still don't fully grasp the severity of Robert's situation.  "Uncritical but unstable" is vague.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's desperation. 
* **No Clear Threat:** What could go wrong?  The paragraph sets up the arrival of the organ but doesn't hint at any potential obstacles.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying Robert is unstable, describe his symptoms or the team's worried expressions.
* **Introduce a potential problem:**  Maybe the helicopter encounter a delay, or there's a complication with the organ itself.
* **Focus on the emotional impact:**  Describe the team's racing hearts, the ticking clock, or Robert's fading hope.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Sensory Details:** The description of the helicopter blades, the wind, and the blue case adds a more immersive and tangible feel.
* **Heightened Stakes:** The mention of the liver being "incompatible" and "meagerly malfunctioning" introduces a new layer of danger.
* **Time Pressure:** The focus on the watch and the need to hurry creates a sense of urgency.

**However, it still needs work:**

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph is still riddled with grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "are," "lack differ told" etc.) which hinder the flow and impact.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We still don't feel the tension or anxiety of the situation.  How do the men feel about the incompatible liver? Are they worried about the patient?
* **Vague Threat:** What exactly is the danger? Is it the liver's condition, the time pressure, or something else entirely?

**To boost the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear, concise writing is crucial for building suspense.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying they are in a hurry, describe their hurried steps, their racing hearts, or their strained expressions.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict or Tension:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or uncertainty.
* **Passive Voice and Uninteresting Details:** The overuse of passive voice ("the cleaner lack begin," "the staff used the lifts") and the focus on trivial details (the placement of fire extinguishers, the cleaner's whistling) make the writing dull and unengaging.
* **No Hook:** There's nothing in the paragraph to grab the reader's attention or make them want to keep reading.

**To make this paragraph more suspenseful:**

* **Introduce a conflict:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual in the stairwell, or someone is following him.
* **Create a sense of mystery:**  Hint at a hidden secret or a past event that might be connected to the stairwell.
* **Use active voice and vivid language:**  Instead of saying "he whistled," describe the tune he whistled and how it made him feel.
* **Focus on the emotional impact:**  Explore the cleaner's thoughts and feelings as he goes about his work. Is he lonely? Bored? Afraid?

I'd rate this paragraph an **8** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The paragraph clearly establishes the life-or-death situation, with the child's survival hinging on the success of the biopsy.
* **Technical Detail:** The use of medical terminology ("ametabolic rate," "antecedent biopsy") adds a sense of realism and urgency.
* **Internal Conflict:** The surgeon's nervousness and the description of his careful movements create a palpable sense of tension.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends just as the surgeon is about to perform the crucial procedure, leaving the reader on the edge of their seat.

**However, it could be improved by:**

* **Tightening the Grammar:** While the language is generally clear, there are a few grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "was," "abstain" instead of "had never," etc.) that could be smoothed out.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying the surgeon was nervous, describe his trembling hands, his racing heart, or his shallow breaths.
* **Sensory Details:**  Adding more sensory details could further immerse the reader in the scene. What does the operating room smell like? What sounds can be heard?

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:
