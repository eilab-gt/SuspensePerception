I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for Danger:** The setup suggests a potential hazard (a wet floor) and the absence of a warning sign creates a sense of risk.
* **Lack of Context:**  We don't know who might be using the stairwell, or why their safety is particularly important. Without context, the potential danger feels abstract.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of the passive voice ("the cleaner had finished...") makes the paragraph feel less immediate and engaging.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a character:**  Mention someone who is about to use the stairwell, creating a sense of immediacy and personal stake.
* **Build tension:**  Describe the sound of footsteps approaching, the slippery floor, or the character's growing awareness of the danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Shift in Setting:**  Moving from the open roof to the enclosed, potentially hazardous service stairwell creates a sense of claustrophobia and raises the stakes.

* **Lack of Detail:**  The paragraph is relatively brief and lacks vivid descriptions or emotional cues.

* **Describe the stairwell:**  Paint a picture of the dimly lit, narrow space, perhaps with creaking steps or a musty smell.
* **Show the men's reactions:**  Describe their expressions, their pace, or any hesitation they might feel as they descend.
* **Hint at a threat:**  Mention a strange noise, a flickering light, or a sense of being watched.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Action, but Lack of Tension:**  The paragraph describes actions (warning the doctors, regaining footing, supervising the case), but it lacks the emotional weight and sense of urgency that would make it truly suspenseful.
