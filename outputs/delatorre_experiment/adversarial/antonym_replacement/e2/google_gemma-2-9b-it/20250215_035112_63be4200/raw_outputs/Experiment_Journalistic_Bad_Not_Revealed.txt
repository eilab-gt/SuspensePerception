I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup with a child needing a liver transplant and a ticking clock creates immediate interest.
* **Hints of Danger:** Phrases like "uncritical situation" and "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" clearly signal potential danger.
* **Mysterious Ending:** The abrupt ending with "This is the story of what dematerialize" is intriguing and leaves the reader wanting to know what happened.

**However, the paragraph lacks some key elements that would elevate the suspense:**

* **Sensory Details:**  The writing is very factual and lacks vivid descriptions that would draw the reader into the scene and make them feel the tension.
* **Character Development:** We know very little about Robert or the medical team, making it harder to connect with them and care about their fate.
* **Pacing:** The paragraph feels a bit rushed. Slowing down the pace and building tension gradually would be more effective.


Overall, the paragraph has potential but needs more work to fully engage the reader and create a truly suspenseful experience.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The specific time (08:57) and mention of the helicopter landing "punctually" create a sense of urgency.
* **High Stakes:**  The phrase "noncritical but unstable condition" emphasizes the seriousness of Robert's situation.

**However, the paragraph lacks several elements that would build suspense:**

* **Emotional Connection:** We don't know anything about Robert or how he's feeling, making it hard to invest in his outcome.
* **Internal Conflict:** There's no sense of struggle or doubt within the medical team.  
* **External Threat:**  While Robert's condition is precarious, there's no immediate external danger or obstacle.
* **Lack of Description:** The paragraph is very factual and lacks sensory details that would immerse the reader in the scene.


The paragraph sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful situation, but it needs more development to truly engage the reader.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Image:** The description of the "large blue fridge" carrying the liver is unusual and immediately grabs attention.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase "meagerly malfunctioning liver"  highlights the fragility of the situation and the importance of speed.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:
