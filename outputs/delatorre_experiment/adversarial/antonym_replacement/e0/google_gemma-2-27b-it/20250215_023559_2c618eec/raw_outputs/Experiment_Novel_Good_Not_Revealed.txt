I would rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes a real-life scenario:** The opening line mentioning a real event immediately grabs attention and adds a layer of seriousness.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The mention of the transplant being imminent and Robert's critical condition creates a sense of urgency.
* **However, the writing is clunky and grammatically incorrect:** This detracts from the suspense. The repeated use of "differ" instead of "were" is jarring and undermines the tension.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Polish the grammar and sentence structure:** Clear, concise writing will enhance the impact.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe Robert's condition, the atmosphere in the hospital, the emotions of the medical team.
* **Build anticipation:** Hint at potential complications or obstacles without revealing too much.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It builds on the previous paragraph:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and awaiting a transplant, so the arrival of the organ raises the stakes.
* **The precise time adds urgency:** "08:57" emphasizes the moment and creates a sense of immediacy.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his symptoms or the reactions of the medical team.
* **Introduce a potential obstacle:**  Maybe there's a problem with the organ, or a complication arises during the transport.
* **End on a cliffhanger:** Leave the reader wondering what will happen next.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Vivid imagery:** The description of the helicopter landing, the men battling the wind, and the precious cargo in the blue case creates a strong visual and sensory experience.
* **Sense of urgency:** The mention of the "incompatible liver" and the men's hurried movements heighten the tension.
* **Intriguing details:** The fact that the liver is "meagerly functioning" and the patient is in a "critical situation" raises questions and concerns.

**Areas for improvement:**

* **Clarity:** Some sentences are a bit clunky and could be rephrased for better flow. For example, "Realizing that he hadn’t fail to make himself heard..." could be simplified.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that they "had no time to lose," show it through their actions and the environment.
* **Build anticipation:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles they might face during the transport.

Overall, this paragraph is suspenseful and engaging, but with some polishing, it could be even more gripping.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane setting and activity:** The focus on the cleaner's routine mopping creates a sense of ordinariness, which works against suspense.
* **Lack of tension or conflict:** There are no immediate threats or obstacles, and the cleaner seems content with his work.
* **Passive voice and lack of sensory detail:** The writing is rather flat and doesn't engage the reader emotionally.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a foreshadowing element:** Maybe the cleaner notices something unusual in the stairwell, or hears a strange noise.
* **Create a sense of isolation:** Emphasize the emptiness and silence of the stairwell, making the cleaner feel alone and vulnerable.
* **Hint at a potential danger:**  Perhaps the cleaner is unaware of a threat lurking nearby, or he's about to stumble upon something disturbing.



This paragraph sets a calm and ordinary scene, which could be used to contrast with a sudden burst of suspense later on. However, on its own, it lacks the elements needed to create a truly suspenseful atmosphere.
