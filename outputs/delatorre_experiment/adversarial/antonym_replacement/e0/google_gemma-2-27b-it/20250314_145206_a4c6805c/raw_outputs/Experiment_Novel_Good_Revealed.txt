Here's why:

* **Introduction of a Deadline:** The mention of the helicopter landing with the organ introduces a sense of urgency and a ticking clock.

* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the patient's critical condition and the lack of time adds to the suspense.

**Areas for Improvement:**

**Here's why:**

* **Mundane Setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of the stairwell create a sense of ordinariness, which works against suspense.
