I would rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors make it difficult to follow the story and create any sense of tension. 
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("differ...," "was...," "were...")  makes the writing feel distant and unemotional.
* **Lack of Vivid Language:** There's no sensory detail or strong imagery to draw the reader in and create a sense of urgency.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical but doesn't show us through his actions, thoughts, or the reactions of those around him.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammar:** Clear and concise writing is essential for building tension.
* **Use active voice:**  Make the writing more direct and engaging.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings of the hospital setting.
* **Show, don't tell:**  Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his symptoms, his interactions with doctors, or the worried expressions on his family's faces.

* **Internal Monologue:**  Including a brief thought or feeling from Robert or a doctor could add emotional weight and suspense.
