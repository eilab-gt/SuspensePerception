 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the mention of the young patient's critical condition, it lacks the build-up and context to create a strong sense of suspense. The paragraph simply states that the helicopter carrying the organ arrived on time, without providing any information about the challenges or obstacles that the medical team might have faced in obtaining the organ or transporting it to the hospital. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included more details about the risks and uncertainties involved in the transplant process.

 I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph introduces a new element of intrigue with the description of the men carrying a small blue fridge containing the liver. The use of the word "fridge" instead of a more technical term adds to the sense of mystery and raises questions about the condition and safety of the organ. However, the paragraph still lacks the context and build-up to create a strong sense of suspense. To increase the tension, the paragraph could have included more details about the journey of the organ, such as the distance it traveled or the challenges it faced during transport. 

Additionally, the use of the word "fully functioning" could be replaced with a more suspenseful term, such as "viable" or "healthy", to create more uncertainty about the organ's condition.
