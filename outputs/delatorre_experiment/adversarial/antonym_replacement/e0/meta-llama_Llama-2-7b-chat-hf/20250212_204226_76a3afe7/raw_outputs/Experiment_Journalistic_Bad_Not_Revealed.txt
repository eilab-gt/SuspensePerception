3. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before adds to the tension, as it suggests that the outcome is far from certain.
4. The phrase "this is the story of what happened" creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen next.

However, there are a few elements that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite straightforward and doesn't use any particularly suspenseful language or techniques.
2. The situation is described in a relatively matter-of-fact way, which takes away from the sense of tension and uncertainty.
