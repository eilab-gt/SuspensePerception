2. Some of the phrases used, such as "differ all ready" and "awaiting the arrival of the organ," are a bit awkward and take away from the overall suspense.
3. The paragraph doesn't have a clear structure or build-up of tension, which can make it feel a bit disjointed and hard to follow.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could benefit from a bit more tightening up and refinement to make it truly gripping and suspenseful.
