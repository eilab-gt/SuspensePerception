I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by describing a critical medical situation (a liver transplant) and a patient's uncertain fate.
* The use of words like "uncritical" and "succumb" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The phrase "what dematerialise" at the end of the paragraph is intriguing and hints at something unexpected or surprising happening, which piques the reader's curiosity.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by:

* The awkward and ungrammatical sentence structure, which can be distracting and takes away from the tension.
* The lack of emotional connection with the protagonist, Robert. We're told he's an 8-year-old boy, but we don't get to know much about him or his situation beyond the medical facts.
* The somewhat dry and clinical tone of the paragraph, which doesn't quite convey the sense of urgency and danger that a more suspenseful passage might.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could be more effective with some revisions to sentence structure, character development, and tone.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation by mentioning the arrival of the organ, which is a critical element in Robert's medical situation.
* The use of a specific time (08:57) adds a sense of realism and creates a sense of urgency.
* The phrase "noncritical but unstable condition" implies that Robert's situation is precarious, which raises some tension.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by:

* The lack of emotional connection with Robert. We're still not getting much sense of who he is or what's at stake beyond the medical facts.
* The somewhat dry and clinical tone of the paragraph, which doesn't convey a sense of danger or urgency.
* The fact that the helicopter lands "punctually" implies that everything is going according to plan, which reduces the sense of tension or surprise.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it's still fairly straightforward and lacks a sense of drama or surprise. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could benefit from more descriptive language, a greater sense of urgency, and a clearer sense of what's at stake for Robert.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a vivid and immersive scene, with descriptive language that puts the reader on the rooftop with the characters. The use of sensory details like the whirlwind of the spinning blades and the men's hair being blown back adds to the tension.
* The introduction of the blue case containing the liver raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The fact that it's "meagerly malfunctioning" implies that something could go wrong, which increases the tension.
* The use of body language and nonverbal communication between the two men (e.g. the nod, the touch on the shoulder) creates a sense of secrecy and importance, which adds to the suspense.
* The phrase "they refuse no time to find" implies that time is of the essence, and that every minute counts. This creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The fact that the patient is in an "uncritical situation" is a bit of a red herring, as it implies that things are not as dire as they seemed earlier. However, this could be a deliberate misdirection, and the use of the word "uncritical" might be meant to lull the reader into a false sense of security.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a bit hard to follow due to the awkward sentence structure and word choice. Some of the sentences are a bit confusing, which takes away from the overall suspensefulness. However, the descriptive language and the sense of urgency and secrecy make this paragraph much more suspenseful than the previous two.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph is primarily focused on describing the daily routine of a hospital cleaner, which is a mundane and ordinary task. There's no sense of urgency, danger, or high stakes.
* The language used is descriptive, but it's more focused on painting a picture of the cleaner's daily routine than creating tension or suspense.
* The paragraph is quite long and meandering, which makes it feel more like a character study or a slice-of-life vignette than a suspenseful passage.
* There are no hints or suggestions of anything out of the ordinary or unexpected happening. The cleaner's routine is portrayed as predictable and uneventful.
* The only potential source of tension is the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to put up "dry floor" warning signs, but this is presented as a minor detail rather than a significant risk or threat.

Overall, this paragraph is more focused on creating a sense of atmosphere and character than building suspense. It's a slow-burning, introspective passage that doesn't have much in the way of tension or surprise.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the route that the man carrying the case must take to reach the patient. The use of specific details like the metal ramp, the service stairwell, and the primary corridors creates a sense of realism and raises the stakes.
* The conversation between the two men adds to the tension, as it implies that time is of the essence and that every minute counts. The fact that they're debating whether to take the lift or the stairs creates a sense of urgency and raises the question of what might happen if they make the wrong choice.
* The use of phrases like "it's not worth abstaining the lift" and "it'll lack obviate unretentive than ride down two floors" creates a sense of pressure and raises the stakes. The men are clearly worried about wasting time, and this worry is infectious.
* The fact that the colleague shrugs and lets go of the bannister with his bound hand adds a sense of unease and raises questions about what might be wrong with his hand.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by:

* The somewhat awkward sentence structure and word choice, which can make it hard to follow at times.
* The lack of emotional connection with the characters. We're still not getting much sense of who they are or what's at stake beyond the medical facts.
* The fact that the tension is still relatively low-key. While there's a sense of urgency, there's no real sense of danger or threat. The stakes are still relatively low, and the outcome is still uncertain.

Overall, this paragraph is more suspenseful than the previous one, but it could still benefit from more descriptive language, a greater sense of urgency, and a clearer sense of what's at stake.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sudden and intense sense of danger and urgency. The man's foot slipping on the second step is a shocking and unexpected event that raises the stakes immediately.
* The use of vivid and descriptive language like "unbend his ankle", "demote", "disallow go of the case", and "deteriorate his balance" creates a sense of chaos and panic.
* The image of the case unwinding down the stairs, making a noise like "a bunch of tight keys differ shaken in a bag", is a powerful and evocative one that raises the tension and creates a sense of horror.
* The fact that the two men are watching in horror, holding their breath, adds to the sense of suspense and raises the question of what will happen next.
* The use of words like "fail", "deteriorate", and "devoice" creates a sense of desperation and hopelessness, which adds to the suspense.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a bit hard to follow due to the awkward sentence structure and word choice. Some of the sentences are a bit confusing, which takes away from the overall suspensefulness. However, the vivid language, the sudden and intense danger, and the sense of horror and desperation make this paragraph very suspenseful overall.
####################################################################################################
I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of relief that the case has finally reached the bottom of the stairs, but this relief is short-lived as the men realize that they don't know if the case has been damaged.
* The warning from the colleague, "We don't ignore if it's differ damaged", raises the stakes and creates a sense of tension. The fact that they need to call the doctors adds to the sense of urgency.
* The decision to have one man stay with the case while the other goes to alert the surgical team creates a sense of division and raises the question of what might happen next.
* The use of phrases like "Without conserve any time" and "ride slowly" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.
* The fact that the man is careful not to slip on the stairs again adds to the sense of tension and raises the question of what might happen if he does slip.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that the suspense is somewhat diminished by the fact that the man is able to rise off down the stairs and make his way to the reception desk without any major obstacles. The paragraph is still very suspenseful, but it's not as intense as the previous one. Additionally, some of the sentence structures and word choices are still a bit awkward, which takes away from the overall suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the surgeon's careful and deliberate actions as he performs the biopsy.
