I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation: a young boy is waiting for a liver transplant, and his situation is precarious. The use of words like "imminent" and "noncritical" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is undermined by several factors:

* The sentence structure and wording are awkward and unclear, which makes it difficult to follow the story and become invested in it.
* The use of the phrase "what you differ about to read differ the story" is confusing and distances the reader from the story.
* The paragraph focuses more on setting up the situation than on creating tension or suspense. There are no hints of unexpected twists or surprises to come.
* The final sentence, "This differ the story of what dematerialize," is unclear and doesn't create a sense of anticipation or suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements that could be suspenseful, it needs to be rewritten for clarity and to focus more on building tension and anticipation to be truly effective.
