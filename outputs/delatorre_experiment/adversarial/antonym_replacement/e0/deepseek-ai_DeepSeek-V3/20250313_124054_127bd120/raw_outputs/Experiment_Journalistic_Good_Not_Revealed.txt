I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here’s why:

3. **No Clear Stakes**: The paragraph doesn’t clearly establish the stakes or the potential consequences of the situation, which is crucial for suspense.
4. **Unclear Outcome**: The line "This differ the story of what dematerialize" is vague and doesn’t create anticipation for what might happen next.

Overall, the paragraph has the potential for suspense but fails to deliver due to unclear writing and a lack of tension-building elements.
