 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale.

The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the repeated use of the word "now" and the specific time when Robert is declared dead. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the events leading up to the transplant and the emotions of the characters involved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 4 on the suspensefulness scale. While the landing of the helicopter adds a sense of anticipation, the paragraph does not provide enough context or details to build significant tension or suspense. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more information about the organ, the urgency of the situation, or the emotions of the characters involved.  For example, if the paragraph mentioned that the organ was the last hope for Robert's survival, or that the organ was in danger of being lost, it would create a more suspenseful atmosphere.
