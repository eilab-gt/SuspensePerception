 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a tense and urgent situation with the impending liver transplant, the uncertainty of the donor's arrival, and the precarious health of the young boy, Robert Bent. The use of phrases like "unreal event," "obviate place," and "differ" create a sense of mystery and intrigue, while the mention of the specific date and location add a sense of reality and ground the story. The use of the word "dematerialize" at the end of the paragraph also leaves the reader wondering what will happen next, increasing the suspense. Overall, the paragraph effectively creates a suspenseful atmosphere and leaves the reader wanting to know more about what will happen to Robert Bent.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph continues to build on the tension created in the previous paragraph by describing the arrival of the organ, but it does not add any new elements of surprise or uncertainty. The use of the specific time adds a sense of urgency, but the fact that the helicopter landed punctually on the roof of the hospital does not create any unexpected twists or turns in the story. Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful in a more straightforward way, as it continues to focus on the impending transplant and the critical nature of Robert Bent's condition. However, it does not add any new elements that would significantly increase the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph does not add any new elements of mystery or uncertainty, and instead focuses on a seemingly unrelated detail about the cleaner mopping the floor. While the cleaner's actions may have unintended consequences for the transplant, the paragraph does not create a sense of urgency or tension. The use of the phrase "minutes earlier" suggests that the cleaner's actions may have some relevance to the story, but the paragraph does not provide any further information to support this. Overall, the paragraph does not significantly contribute to the suspense created in the previous paragraphs and may even detract from the overall tension of the story.
