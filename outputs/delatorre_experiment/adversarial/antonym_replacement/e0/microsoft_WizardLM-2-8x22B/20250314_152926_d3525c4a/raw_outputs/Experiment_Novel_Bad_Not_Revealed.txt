The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical and time-sensitive medical situation involving a young boy in urgent need of a liver transplant. The mention of the donor organ's availability the day before, followed by the uncertainty of whether Robert will survive the wait, creates a sense of urgency and tension. The use of the word "differ" to emphasize the contrast between the anticipation and the unknown outcome of the situation adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The reader is left wondering about the fate of Robert, the arrival of the organ, and the success of the transplant, which are all classic elements of suspense. The only limitation to the suspense is that the paragraph is quite brief and does not delve deeply into the characters' emotions or the specific challenges they might face, which could have heightened the suspense even further.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level. It provides a vivid, cinematic description of the men carrying the liver in a blue case, emphasizing the delicate nature of the organ and the precision required to maintain its viability. The detail that the liver is incompatible adds a new layer of tension, as it introduces a potential complication that the reader anticipates will need to be resolved. The urgency is palpable as one of the men ensures they are understood despite the noise, emphasizing the importance of time.

The focus on the men's actions, the pointing at the watch, and the communication without words all contribute to a sense of high stakes and the critical nature of the situation.

This paragraph introduces a new element that could potentially impact the unfolding events at the hospital but does so in a way that builds suspense more subtly. The description of the cleaner's routine and his preference for the service stairwell over the bustling corridors sets a backdrop that feels somewhat disconnected from the urgent medical drama we anticipate is happening elsewhere in the hospital. The mundane nature of the cleaner's job and his contentment with it provide a stark contrast to the high-stakes situation with Robert Bent.

The suspense arises from the potential for the cleaner's actions—specifically, not placing "dry floor" signs—to inadvertently interfere with the critical transport of the liver. The reader is aware that the cleaner's routine could have unforeseen consequences, and the detail that he begins mopping in fifteen minutes suggests a countdown that could lead to a collision of circumstances. However, the suspense is not as immediate or intense as in the previous paragraphs because the connection between the cleaner's actions and the transplant's success is not yet clear. The paragraph sets up a situation that could lead to suspense rather than delivering a direct threat or complication, hence the lower rating on the suspense scale.

This paragraph introduces a sense of procedural tension as the men carrying the liver navigate the hospital's layout to reach their destination. The description of the path they must take, including the specifics of the corridors and the location of the lift, creates a sense of place and the complexity of maneuvering through a large institution. The potential for delay due to the cleaner's absence of warning signs in the service stairwell is hinted at, which could lead to a suspenseful situation if the men were to encounter a wet floor.

The dialogue between the two men about taking the lift versus using the stairs adds to the suspense by highlighting their awareness of the time-sensitive nature of their task. The decision to use the lift despite its potential inefficiency suggests that they are prioritizing speed and safety of the organ over other considerations. The reader is left to wonder whether this choice will prove beneficial or if it will lead to unforeseen complications, such as encountering the cleaner or the wet floor.

The suspense is present but not as acute as it could be because the immediate threat or obstacle is not yet directly confronted. The paragraph sets up potential challenges without fully exploiting them, which is why it falls in the middle range of the suspense scale.

The description of the case's design, revealing a "large padded fridge," suggests the care taken to preserve the organ, which in turn underscores the potential for disaster if the fall has compromised it.

The brief, non-verbal cue of the doctor shaking his head immediately raises the tension, as it suggests bad news. However, the suspense is not immediately resolved, as the doctor proceeds to open the case. The revelation that the fridge is split and refrigerated air is escaping quickly creates a cliffhanger, leaving the reader in suspense about the state of the liver inside.
