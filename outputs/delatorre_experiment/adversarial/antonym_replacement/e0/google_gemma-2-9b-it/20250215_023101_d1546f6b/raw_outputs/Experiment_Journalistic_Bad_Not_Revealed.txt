I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup with a child needing a liver transplant and a ticking clock creates immediate interest.
* **Hints of Danger:** Phrases like "uncritical situation" and "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" clearly signal potential danger.
* **Mysterious Ending:** The abrupt ending with "This is the story of what dematerialize" is intriguing and leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**However, the paragraph lacks some key elements that would elevate the suspense:**

* **Sensory Details:**  The writing is quite clinical and lacks vivid descriptions that would draw the reader into the scene and make the situation feel more urgent.
* **Character Development:** We know very little about Robert or the medical team, making it harder to connect with them emotionally and invest in their fate.
* **Rising Tension:** The paragraph doesn't build tension effectively. It states the facts but doesn't create a sense of growing dread or anticipation.


To make the paragraph more suspenseful, consider adding:

* **Sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's physical state, the sounds and smells.
* **Internal thoughts:** Give us glimpses into Robert's fear or the medical team's anxiety.
* **Foreshadowing:**  Hint at potential complications or setbacks.
* **Pacing:**  Slow down the pace in key moments to heighten the tension.

* **Heightening the Emotional Stakes:**  Give us a glimpse into Robert's fear or the medical team's anxiety.
* **Creating Foreshadowing:**  Hint at potential complications or delays.


The paragraph sets the stage for a suspenseful moment, but it could be more impactful with some added depth and emotional resonance.
