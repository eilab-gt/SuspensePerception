I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of immediate threat:** While the situation is serious (a child needing a liver transplant), the paragraph doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or urgency. 
* **Telling, not showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is "uncritical" and the team is "unready" but doesn't show us any of the emotional tension or physical stress involved.
* **Repetitive phrasing:** The repeated use of "differ" and "negate" is awkward and disrupts the flow, making it harder to get invested in the story.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his fear, hope, or pain.
* **Highlight the ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time Robert has and the race against the clock.
* **Introduce an unexpected obstacle:**  Perhaps there's a complication during the surgery or a last-minute problem with the organ.
* **Use stronger, more evocative language:** Replace bland words with more vivid descriptions that create a stronger emotional impact.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing setup:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ immediately raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Contrasting information:**  The phrase "uncritical but unstable condition" adds a layer of complexity and uncertainty. We know Robert needs the transplant, but his condition is precarious.
* **Lack of detail:** The paragraph is very brief and lacks descriptive language or emotional depth. It tells us what's happening but doesn't make us *feel* the tension.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical team.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter blades, the smell of antiseptic in the air, or the frantic pace of the medical staff.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Perhaps the helicopter encounters bad weather, or there's a delay in getting the organ to Robert.

* **Introduce an anomaly:** Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, like a hidden door or a strange message.

* **Create a sense of unease:**  Describe the stairwell in a more unsettling way, emphasizing its darkness, emptiness, or isolation.
