I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness.

* **Building Tension:** The paragraph describes the anticipation and urgency surrounding the transplant, highlighting the boy's critical condition and the race against time.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph uses confusing and grammatically incorrect phrasing ("differ all ready," "they differ now awaiting," etc.), which disrupts the flow and makes it harder to fully engage with the suspense.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The ending feels rushed and anticlimactic. The phrase "This differ the story of what dematerialize" is unclear and doesn't provide a satisfying resolution or leave the reader wanting more.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**
