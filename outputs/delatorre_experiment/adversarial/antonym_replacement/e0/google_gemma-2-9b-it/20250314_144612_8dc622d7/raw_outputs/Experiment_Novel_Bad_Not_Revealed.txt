I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "will differ,"  "lack differ abolish" etc.) distract from the potential suspense and make the writing feel clunky.
* **Lack of Clear Stakes:** While we understand Robert needs a liver transplant, the paragraph doesn't effectively convey the urgency or danger of his situation.  "Noncritical" undermines the sense of impending doom.
* **Vague Threat:** The phrase "what dematerialise" is confusing and doesn't create a clear sense of what might go wrong.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear, concise writing is essential for building suspense.
* **Raise the stakes:** Emphasize the severity of Robert's condition and the potential consequences of the wait.
* **Create a tangible threat:**  Instead of "what dematerialise," hint at a specific danger, like complications during surgery or a sudden change in Robert's health.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Improved Timing:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of immediacy and build anticipation.
* **Contrasting Information:** The juxtaposition of "punctually" and "unstable condition" adds a layer of tension.  We know the organ arrived on time, but Robert's condition is precarious.

**However, it still lacks some key elements for higher suspense:**

* **Lack of Character Focus:** We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's anxiety.  
* **Missing Stakes:**  While we know Robert is unstable, the paragraph doesn't clearly convey what will happen if the transplant isn't successful.
* **Passive Voice:** "Robert Bent differ in a uncritical but unstable condition" is a bit clunky and passive.  

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical team.
* **Highlight the risks:**  What are the potential consequences if the transplant fails?  
* **Use active voice:**  "Robert Bent lay in a uncritical but unstable condition" is more impactful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Details:** The focus on the helicopter landing, the blue case containing the liver, and the hushed conversation create a sense of mystery and urgency.
* **Sensory Details:**  "Heads down and hair conserve by the whirlwind" and "meagerly malfunctioning" add a layer of realism and tension.

**However, it still needs work:**

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "are," "lack differ told" etc.) which distract from the flow and suspense.
* **Unclear Stakes:** While we know the liver is important, the paragraph doesn't clearly convey the potential consequences if they don't get it to the patient in time.
* **Passive Voice:**  Phrases like "the liver differ storing" and "they abstain no time" are passive and weaken the impact.

**To boost the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear, concise writing is essential for building suspense.
* **Raise the stakes:**  Describe the potential consequences of the liver not arriving on time.  Will Robert die? Will the transplant fail?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying they "abstain no time," describe their hurried movements and frantic expressions.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There's no immediate threat, mystery, or sense of danger.
* **Passive Voice and Repetitive Language:**  Phrases like "he abstain end," "the service stairwell refuse no windows," and "he begin mopping" are passive and make the writing feel flat. The overuse of "differ" is also distracting.
* **Unclear Purpose:**  The paragraph doesn't seem to be building towards anything. We don't know why the cleaner's routine is important or if anything unusual is about to happen.

**To make this paragraph more suspenseful:**

* **Introduce a conflict:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unexpected in the stairwell, or someone starts following him.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Use sensory details to create a creepy or unsettling atmosphere.
* **Hint at a larger mystery:**  Drop subtle clues that suggest something is amiss in the hospital.
* **Focus on the cleaner's thoughts and feelings:**  Is he nervous?  Curious?  Afraid?

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setting:** The description of the helipad exit, service stairwell, and hospital corridors creates a sense of place and potential for hidden secrets.
* **Character Interaction:** The brief dialogue between the two men adds a layer of tension and raises questions about their motives.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the need to be quick adds a sense of urgency.

**However, it still needs some work:**

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The overuse of "differ" and other grammatical errors distract from the flow and suspense.
* **Lack of Emotional Depth:** We don't get a strong sense of the men's emotions or the weight of the situation.
* **Missing Stakes:** While we know time is of the essence, the paragraph doesn't clearly convey the potential consequences if they don't reach the patient in time.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Fix the grammar:**  Clear, concise writing is essential for building suspense.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying they are in a hurry, describe their hurried movements and worried expressions.

I'd rate this paragraph an **8** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Sudden Action:** The paragraph opens with a sudden, unexpected slip, immediately grabbing the reader's attention.
* **Heightened Stakes:** The falling case, containing the vital organ, creates a palpable sense of danger and urgency.
* **Sensory Details:**  The description of the case "spinning over on every step" and the "noise that devoice like a bunch of tight keys" adds a visceral element to the scene.
* **Suspenseful Climax:** The ending, with the men watching in horror, leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, desperate to know what happens next.

**However, there are still a few areas for improvement:**

* **Grammatical Errors:**  While the errors are less frequent than in previous paragraphs, they still detract from the flow.  
* **Show, Don't Tell:**  Instead of saying they "let go of their breath," describe their physical reactions â€“  gasping, clutching their chests, etc.

**Overall, this paragraph is very effective at building suspense. The combination of action, danger, and sensory details creates a gripping moment.**

Here's why:

* **Tragic Conclusion:** The paragraph delivers a definitive and tragic ending, which can be impactful.
* **Clear Cause:** The reason for Robert's death is clearly stated, providing a sense of closure.

**However, it lacks the suspenseful elements that were present in previous paragraphs:**
