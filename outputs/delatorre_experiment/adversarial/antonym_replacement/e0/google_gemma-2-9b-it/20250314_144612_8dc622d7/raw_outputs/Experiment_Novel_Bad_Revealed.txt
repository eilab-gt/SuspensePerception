I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("differ" instead of "were,"  inconsistent tense) distract the reader and make it difficult to focus on the potential suspense.
* **Lack of Emotional Hook:** While the situation described is serious, the writing lacks emotional depth. We don't feel Robert's fear or the team's desperation.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the situation ("Robert's situation differed noncritical," "the organ negated in transit") instead of showing it through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Fixing the grammar:**  Clear and concise writing is essential for building suspense.
* **Focusing on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's physical state, the team's anxious movements.
* **Using strong verbs and evocative language:**  Instead of "the organ negated in transit," try something like "the organ arrived, ravaged and useless."
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Use time markers and short sentences to build tension.
* **Ending on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a question or a sense of unease.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of the organ at a specific time, coupled with Robert's precarious condition, creates a sense of anticipation.
* **Limited Detail:** The paragraph lacks descriptive details that could heighten the suspense. We don't know how Robert is feeling, what the atmosphere in the hospital is like, or the team's reactions to the helicopter's arrival.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of "differ in a noncritical but unstable condition" is a bit passive.  A more active voice could create more tension.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Adding sensory details:** Describe the whirring of the helicopter blades, the tense faces of the medical staff, the beeping of machines in the background.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his labored breathing, his pale skin, or his clenched fists.
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  Use shorter sentences and strong verbs to convey the pressure of the situation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict or Tension:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or uncertainty.
* **Passive Voice and Telling:** The writing relies heavily on passive voice ("the cleaner lack begin," "the staff used the lifts") and tells us about the job's unpleasantness instead of showing it through vivid descriptions or interactions.
* **Unclear Purpose:**  The paragraph doesn't seem to be building towards anything specific. We don't know why the cleaner's routine is important or if anything unusual is about to happen.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Introducing a conflict or obstacle:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unexpected in the stairwell, or someone interrupts his routine.
* **Creating a sense of unease:** Use sensory details to create a creepy or unsettling atmosphere.
* **Hinting at a larger mystery:**  Drop subtle clues that suggest something more is going on than meets the eye.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** While the information is significant (the death of Robert Bent), the paragraph is delivered in a very matter-of-fact way, lacking emotional weight.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph simply states the facts without showing us the emotional impact on the surgical team or the family.

**To increase the suspensefulness, consider:**

* **Focusing on the emotional impact:** Describe the surgical team's reactions to the news, their disappointment, their grief.
