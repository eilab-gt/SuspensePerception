I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and unusual context, which grabs the reader's attention. The use of a real hospital and a specific date adds to the sense of realism.
* The introduction of a critical medical situation, with a child's life hanging in the balance, is inherently suspenseful.
* The use of phrases like "refuse to place" and "differ all unready" creates a sense of uncertainty and tension.
* The mention of a suitable donor being found, but the team not being sure if the child will survive the wait, raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Created a stronger sense of foreboding or impending doom. The phrase "This is the story of what dematerialize" is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't quite convey the sense of danger that the situation warrants.
* Built more tension and suspense through the use of more descriptive language. The paragraph is quite straightforward and lacks vivid details that could make the situation feel more intense.
* Introduced more conflict or obstacles that the medical team faces. The paragraph is quite straightforward and doesn't really hint at any potential complications or setbacks that the team might encounter.

Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but could be even more effective with some additional attention to building tension and creating a sense of urgency.
