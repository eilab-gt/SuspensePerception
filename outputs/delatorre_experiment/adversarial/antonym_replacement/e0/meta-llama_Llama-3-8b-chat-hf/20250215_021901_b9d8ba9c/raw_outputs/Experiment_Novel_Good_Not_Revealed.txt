I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the setting, which is a good way to build tension, but it's not particularly suspenseful on its own.
* The introduction of Robert Bent and the medical team is straightforward and doesn't create much tension.
* The mention of the suitable donor being abolished and the team waiting for the organ is a bit more suspenseful, as it creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen if the organ doesn't arrive.
* However, the paragraph ends with a somewhat flat statement about the story that's about to be told, which doesn't really leave the reader with a sense of anticipation or curiosity.

Overall, the paragraph does a decent job of setting up the story and creating some tension, but it could be more effective at building suspense and keeping the reader engaged.
