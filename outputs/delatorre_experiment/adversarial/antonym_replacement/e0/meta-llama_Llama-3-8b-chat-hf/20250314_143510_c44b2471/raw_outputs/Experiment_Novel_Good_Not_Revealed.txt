I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is necessary but not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of the main character, Robert Bent, and the fact that he's waiting for a liver transplant creates some tension, but it's not particularly surprising or unexpected.
* The mention of the donor organ being lost and the team being unsure if Robert will survive the wait creates some suspense, but it's not fully developed or built upon.
* The final sentence, "This differ the story of what dematerialise," is unclear and doesn't add to the suspense. It seems to be a mistake or a non-sequitur, which disrupts the flow of the paragraph.

Overall, the paragraph has some elements of suspense, but it's not particularly well-developed or effective. It could be improved by adding more tension, surprise, or uncertainty to keep the reader engaged.
