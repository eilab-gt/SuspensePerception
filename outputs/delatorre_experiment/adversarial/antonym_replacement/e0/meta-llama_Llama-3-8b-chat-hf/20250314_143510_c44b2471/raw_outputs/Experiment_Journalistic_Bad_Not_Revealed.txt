I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation with a child in need of a liver transplant and a team waiting for a suitable donor organ, but it fails to create a sense of tension or urgency.

Additionally, the paragraph ends abruptly with "This differ the story of what dematerialize", which is unclear and doesn't provide any sense of what's to come, making it hard to care about the outcome. Overall, the paragraph lacks the necessary elements to create a sense of suspense.
