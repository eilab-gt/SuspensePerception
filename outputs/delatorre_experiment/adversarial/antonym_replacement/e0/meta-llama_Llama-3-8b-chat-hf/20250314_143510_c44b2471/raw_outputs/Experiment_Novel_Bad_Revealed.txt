I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing some background information, which is not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of the main character, Robert Bent, and the situation he's in (awaiting a liver transplant) is somewhat suspenseful, as it creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen to him.
* The mention of the donor organ's damage and the team's inability to perform the transplant creates a sense of tension and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder what will happen to Robert.
* However, the paragraph's writing style and sentence structure are not particularly engaging or suspenseful. The use of phrases like "differ all unready" and "differ not unsure" is awkward and detracts from the overall impact of the story.
* The paragraph's tone is more informative than suspenseful, and the language used is quite formal and clinical, which doesn't create a sense of urgency or tension.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some suspense, it could be more effective with more engaging writing and a more dramatic tone.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and tension by setting a specific time (08:57) and describing the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ.
* The fact that the helicopter landed "punctually" implies that the team was waiting for this moment, and that it's a critical moment in Robert's treatment.
* The description of Robert's condition as "noncritical but unstable" raises questions about his health and creates a sense of uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
* The use of the word "punctually" also implies a sense of urgency and importance, which adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph is still somewhat limited in its suspensefulness because:

* It's a relatively short and simple paragraph, and the language used is straightforward and lacks dramatic flair.
* There's no real sense of danger or threat, and the situation is more focused on the medical procedure than on any kind of conflict or obstacle.
* The paragraph doesn't really raise any questions or create any real tension, it's more of a "and then this happened" kind of sentence.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some suspense, it's more of a gentle build-up rather than a intense, thrilling moment.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a vivid and intense atmosphere by describing the scene in detail, including the sound of the helicopter blades and the movement of the two men.
* The use of sensory details, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "hair conserve" by the wind, helps to immerse the reader in the scene and creates a sense of tension.
* The introduction of the blue case and the fact that it contains the incompatible liver raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, as the reader knows that time is of the essence.
* The whispering between the two men adds to the sense of tension and mystery, as the reader is left wondering what they are saying and what is going to happen next.
* The use of short, concise sentences and the focus on the actions of the two men creates a sense of pace and momentum, drawing the reader forward.
* The phrase "they lack no time to win" is particularly effective in creating a sense of suspense, as it implies that the outcome is far from certain and that the stakes are high.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is still somewhat focused on the medical procedure and the logistics of the situation, rather than creating a sense of danger or conflict. The tension is more focused on the urgency of the situation rather than a sense of threat or menace. However, the paragraph is still very effective in creating a sense of suspense and tension, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

* The description of the service stairwell and the hospital's corridors is detailed, but it's more focused on the setting than on creating tension or suspense.
* The cleaner's thoughts and feelings are also described in a matter-of-fact way, which doesn't create a sense of urgency or danger.
* The only slightly suspenseful moment is the mention of the "dry floor" warning signs, but it's not clear why they're important or what might happen if they're not in place.

Overall, this paragraph is more focused on setting the scene and describing the cleaner's routine than on creating suspense or tension. It's a very slow-paced and uneventful passage that doesn't grab the reader's attention or make them wonder what will happen next.
