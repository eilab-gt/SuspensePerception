I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of tension and urgency by describing the critical situation of the 8-year-old boy, Robert Bent, who is waiting for a liver transplant. The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait creates a sense of suspense. However, the paragraph is more informative and factual than suspenseful, as it provides a straightforward account of the events without building up to a dramatic climax. The use of specific times and details, such as the exact time of the transplant (21:26), adds to the sense of realism and factualness, but does not necessarily create a sense of suspense. Overall, the paragraph is engaging and informative, but not particularly suspenseful.

The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and tension by describing the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, which is a crucial moment in the story.
