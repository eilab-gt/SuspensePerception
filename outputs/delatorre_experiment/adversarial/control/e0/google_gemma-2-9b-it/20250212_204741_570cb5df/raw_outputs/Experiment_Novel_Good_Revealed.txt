I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Resolution, Not Suspense:** This paragraph provides a resolution to the tension built up in the previous paragraphs. It tells us the outcome, rather than keeping us in suspense.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very brief and lacks the vivid descriptions and emotional depth that would create a strong sense of suspense.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The statement "the medical team verified" is telling rather than showing. We don't see their reactions, hear their words, or experience the moment of relief.

**To make this paragraph more suspenseful, you could:**

* **Show the verification process:** Describe the medical team's actions, the instruments they use, and their expressions as they monitor Robert's vital signs.

* **Add a final twist:** Perhaps there's a last-minute complication or a lingering uncertainty that keeps the reader on edge even after the successful transplant.



As it stands, this paragraph provides closure but lacks the suspenseful qualities that make a story truly gripping.
