  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

4. The use of phrases such as "just the day before" and "finally" creates a sense of anticipation and builds up to the climax of the story.

However, there are a few things that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

2. The cause of Robert's death is revealed quite quickly, which takes away some of the mystery and suspense.
