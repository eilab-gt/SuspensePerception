The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a high-stakes medical procedure and an uncertain outcome. The fact that the boy's situation was critical and that the success of the transplant was in doubt adds to the tension. However, the paragraph does not contain any dramatic twists or cliffhangers, and the outcome is revealed relatively early on. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It describes the outcome of the liver transplant, where the medical team verifies that the newly transplanted liver is functioning correctly and has not been affected by the damage sustained in transit. This creates a sense of relief and hope, but also leaves the reader wondering about the potential long-term complications that could still arise. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
