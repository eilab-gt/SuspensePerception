I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a critical situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph establishes a clear sense of urgency with the impending transplant and Robert's precarious condition. 
* **Lack of Conflict:**  While the situation is tense, there's no real conflict or obstacle presented. We know the transplant happens successfully, so the suspense is lessened.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the tension ("Robert's situation was critical") rather than showing it through vivid descriptions or internal thoughts.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on the unknown:**  Highlight the uncertainty surrounding the donor organ's condition or the potential complications of the surgery.
* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps there's a last-minute problem with the organ, a delay, or a complication during the procedure.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the atmosphere in the hospital, the sounds, the smells, and the emotions of the medical team and Robert's family.

Here's why:

* **Building on Previous Suspense:** This paragraph directly follows the one about the "wet floor" sign, creating a natural link and amplifying the potential danger.
* **Choice Creates Tension:** The decision to use the service stairwell, rather than a more direct route, adds a layer of uncertainty. Why did they choose this path?
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the condition of the stairwell, the men's experience with it, or if they are aware of the potential hazard.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Describe the stairwell:**  Is it dark, narrow, cluttered?  Adding sensory details can heighten the sense of unease.
* **Introduce a sense of urgency:**  Perhaps they are running late, or there's a reason they need to get to the lower level quickly.
* **Hint at a potential obstacle:**  Maybe there's a loose step, a flickering light, or a strange noise coming from the stairwell.

Overall, this paragraph is very effective at building suspense and leaving the reader wanting more.
