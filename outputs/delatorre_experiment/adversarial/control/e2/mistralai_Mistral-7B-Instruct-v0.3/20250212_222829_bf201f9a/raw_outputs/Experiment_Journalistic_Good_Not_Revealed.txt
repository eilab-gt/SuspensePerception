 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "entire medical team" and the "suitable donor." However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Robert's condition or the challenges that the medical team might face during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually," but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ or the helicopter ride, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant.  For example, "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition. As the medical team rushed to unload the organ, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as they knew that every second counted."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds a sense of urgency with the mention of the "two men" and the "small blue fridge," but it could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the liver or the men carrying it. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant, or it could describe the men's expressions or actions as they approach the hospital. For example, "Two men descended from the helicopter, their faces etched with concern as they carried a small blue fridge, in the shape of a case, which stored the fully functioning liver. As they approached the hospital, the medical team watched with bated breath, hoping that the organ would be in perfect condition."

The paragraph does not add much to the overall suspense of the story and seems to be a tangential detail that does not contribute to the tension.

For example, "Minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign. As the medical team rushed to the operating room, they had to navigate the slippery stairs, their minds focused on the critical liver transplant that was about to take place."  This rewrite adds a sense of urgency and potential danger to the cleaner's actions, making the paragraph more suspenseful.
