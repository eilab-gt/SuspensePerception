I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of tension and urgency by describing the critical situation of the 8-year-old boy, Robert Bent, who is waiting for a liver transplant. The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait creates a sense of suspense. However, the paragraph is more informative and factual than suspenseful, as it provides a straightforward account of the events without building up to a dramatic climax. The use of specific times and details, such as the exact time of the transplant (21:26), adds to the sense of realism and factualness, but may detract from the suspenseful tone. Overall, the paragraph is engaging and informative, but it could benefit from more dramatic language and plot twists to increase its suspensefulness.
