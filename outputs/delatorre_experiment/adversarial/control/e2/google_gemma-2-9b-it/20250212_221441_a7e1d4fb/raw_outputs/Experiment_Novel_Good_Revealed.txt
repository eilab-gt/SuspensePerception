Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the mundane details of a cleaning routine. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or conflict.
* **Predictable Plot:**  The story follows a very predictable pattern: the cleaner cleans, he finishes, he goes back down. There are no surprises or unexpected turns.

* **Build Tension:** Use shorter sentences, more active verbs, and sensory details to create a sense of urgency or unease.
