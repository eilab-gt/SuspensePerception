I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** Starting with "What you are about to read is the story of a real event" immediately grabs the reader's attention and sets a serious tone.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a liver transplant and Robert's critical condition establishes a sense of urgency and danger.
* **Ticking Clock:** The phrase "awaiting the arrival of the organ" introduces a time constraint, adding to the suspense.

However:

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While Robert's situation is serious, there's no immediate, tangible threat described in this paragraph. The suspense is more about anticipation and uncertainty.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph mostly tells us about the situation rather than showing us through vivid descriptions or action.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could benefit from:

* **Sensory Details:** Describing Robert's physical state, the atmosphere in the hospital, or the emotions of the medical team.
* **Foreshadowing:** Hinting at potential complications or obstacles that could arise.
* **A More Immediate Threat:** Introducing a specific event or development that raises the stakes even higher.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Punctuality:** The emphasis on the helicopter landing "punctually" creates a slight sense of anticipation. We know the organ is crucial, so its timely arrival is important.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the helicopter's arrival with Robert's "critical but stable" condition hints at the precariousness of the situation.

However:

* **Lack of Tension:** The paragraph is primarily informational. It states facts without building tension or creating a sense of impending danger.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("was in a critical but stable condition") distances the reader from the action and reduces the emotional impact.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Describe the helicopter's descent, the whirring blades, the tension among the medical team as they await the organ.
* **Focus on Robert:**  Give us a glimpse into Robert's state, his thoughts or feelings, to make his situation more immediate and relatable.
* **Introduce a Complication:** Hint at a potential problem with the organ or the transplant process to raise the stakes.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Action and Urgency:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, the whirring blades, and the shouted, inaudible message creates a sense of urgency and action.
* **Focus on the Organ:** The emphasis on the blue case containing the liver, its temperature, and functionality highlights the preciousness of the cargo and the stakes involved.
* **Non-Verbal Communication:** The use of gestures and nods to communicate amidst the noise adds to the tension and sense of immediacy.
* **Time Pressure:** The reminder that the patient is in a critical situation and they have no time to lose ratchets up the suspense.

However:

* **Limited Emotional Connection:** We still don't have a strong emotional connection to Robert or the medical team.

To increase suspense further:

* **Internal Monologue:** Include the thoughts or feelings of one of the men carrying the liver, revealing their anxieties or concerns.
* **Obstacles:** Introduce a minor obstacle or delay during their journey to the operating room, heightening the tension.
* **Sensory Details:**  Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital environment to immerse the reader in the scene.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Details:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful aspects of the cleaner's job. The detailed description of his cleaning process and his thoughts about the job create a sense of normalcy and predictability.
* **Lack of Threat:** There's no hint of danger or impending threat. The cleaner's actions and thoughts are completely ordinary.
* **Irrelevant Information:**  Details about the fire extinguishers, the doctors, and the patients' boredom are irrelevant to the overall narrative and don't contribute to suspense.

This paragraph serves more as background information or exposition, setting the scene but not building tension. 

To increase suspense, this paragraph would need a significant rewrite, introducing an element of danger or foreshadowing a potential problem related to the cleaner's actions. For example:

* **Omission:** The cleaner could accidentally leave a puddle of water in a crucial spot, creating a potential hazard for someone rushing through the stairwell.
* **Discovery:** The cleaner could stumble upon something unusual or out of place in the stairwell, hinting at a hidden danger.
* **Foreshadowing:** The cleaner could have a premonition or a strange feeling about the day, suggesting that something is amiss.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Sense of Urgency:** The emphasis on time and the need to get to the 6th floor quickly maintains a sense of urgency.
* **Decision-Making:** The brief exchange between the men about taking the lift or the stairs highlights the importance of every second and adds a touch of tension.
* **Focus on the Goal:** The paragraph keeps the reader focused on the men's mission to deliver the liver, building anticipation for what will happen next.

However:

* **Lack of Obstacles:** The decision to take the stairs is straightforward and lacks any real conflict or obstacle.
* **Limited Sensory Detail:** The description of the corridor and stairwell is rather bland and doesn't create a strong sense of atmosphere.

To increase suspense:

* **Introduce a Complication:** Perhaps the stairwell is dimly lit, or they encounter an unexpected obstacle on their way down.
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  Hint at the potential consequences of a delay, emphasizing the fragility of the situation.
* **Internal Monologue:** Include the thoughts or feelings of one of the men, revealing their anxieties about the time pressure or the importance of their task.

* **High Stakes:** The case containing the liver is now rolling down the stairs, raising the stakes dramatically and creating a sense of urgency and dread.

This paragraph effectively uses a sudden turn of events, vivid imagery, and emotional cues to create a highly suspenseful moment.

However:

Here's why:

* **Internal Conflict:** The man's struggle with pain and his superstitious belief that his suffering is linked to the liver's fate creates a compelling internal conflict that adds to the suspense.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of his injured ankle and the pain he endures grounds the scene in physical reality and heightens the tension.
* **Anticipation:** The arrival of the doctors and their urgency build anticipation for the moment of truth â€“ will the liver be okay?

* **Shift in Focus:** The paragraph shifts focus from the physical danger to the psychological and emotional state of the man guarding the case. This adds depth and complexity to the suspense.

To further increase suspense:

* **Delay the Reveal:**  Instead of immediately revealing the doctors' assessment of the liver, prolong the moment of uncertainty. Describe their examination in detail, highlighting their concern and the fragility of the situation.
* **Introduce Doubt:**  Hint at the possibility that the liver might be damaged, even if subtly. This will keep the reader on edge, wondering about the outcome.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the man's superstition, show it through his actions and thoughts. For example, describe him clenching his jaw or whispering a prayer.

* **Visual Clues:** The description of the surgeon wiping sweat, pursed lips, and blinking suggests his growing anxiety and the gravity of the situation.
* **Delayed Revelation:** The suspense is heightened by delaying the reveal of the diagnosis, keeping the reader on edge.

However:

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Stark Reality:** The blunt statement of Robert's death is impactful and delivers a sense of finality.
* **Unsuccessful Outcome:** The confirmation that the transplant couldn't be performed due to the damaged liver adds to the tragedy and reinforces the stakes.
* **Conciseness:** The brevity of the paragraph emphasizes the suddenness and finality of the situation.

However:

* **Lack of Emotional Resonance:** The paragraph feels somewhat detached and lacks emotional depth. We don't get a sense of the grief, disappointment, or frustration of the medical team or the impact on Robert's family.
* **Limited Context:** The paragraph doesn't provide any insight into the immediate aftermath of Robert's death or the reactions of those involved.

To increase suspense:

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating Robert's death, describe the scene, the reactions of the medical team, and the atmosphere in the room.
* **Emotional Impact:** Explore the feelings of loss, disappointment, and perhaps even anger that the team might be experiencing.
* **Lingering Questions:** Leave the reader with some unanswered questions or a sense of unease. For example, what happens to the damaged liver? What are the implications for future organ transplants?
