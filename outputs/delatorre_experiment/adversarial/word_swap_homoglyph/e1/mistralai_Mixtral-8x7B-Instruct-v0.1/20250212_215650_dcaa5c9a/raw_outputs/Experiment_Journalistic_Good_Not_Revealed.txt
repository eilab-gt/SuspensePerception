 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a brief update on the progress of the story, with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the liver for the transplant. However, the paragraph does not provide much context or detail about the events leading up to this point, or the challenges and obstacles that may still be faced.
