I would rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

  - The mention of a real event adds a layer of tension and realism.  
  - The phrase "This is the story of what happened" creates anticipation for what comes next.

  - The suspense is somewhat muted because the paragraph is more of an introduction than a detailed, unfolding narrative.  
  - There’s no immediate action or cliffhanger to heighten the tension.  
  - The tone is more informative than gripping, which limits the emotional intensity.  

Overall, it’s a solid setup for suspense but could be more engaging with sharper pacing or a more immediate sense of danger.
