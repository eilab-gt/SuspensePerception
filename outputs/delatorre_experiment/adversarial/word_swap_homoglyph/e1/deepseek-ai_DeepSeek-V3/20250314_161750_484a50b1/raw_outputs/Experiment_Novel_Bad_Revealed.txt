I would rate this paragraph at **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy in critical condition awaiting a life-saving liver transplant. The uncertainty about whether the organ will arrive in time and the ultimate tragic outcome create a sense of tension and urgency. The specific details, such as the time of death and the reason for the failed transplant, add to the emotional weight and realism.
  
- **Weaknesses**: While the stakes are high, the paragraph lacks some elements that could heighten suspense further, such as a more detailed buildup of the waiting period, the emotional state of the characters, or the specific challenges faced during the organ's transit. The outcome is revealed abruptly, which reduces the lingering sense of anticipation.

Overall, it’s suspenseful due to the life-and-death scenario, but it could be more gripping with additional narrative tension and delayed resolution.

I would rate this paragraph at **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph introduces a sense of urgency with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, which is critical for Robert's survival. The mention of Robert being in a "critical but stable condition" adds some tension, as it highlights the precariousness of his situation.

Overall, while there is a hint of tension due to the critical nature of the situation, the paragraph doesn't effectively build suspense or create a sense of anticipation.
