I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait creates tension. The mention of a real event and specific details (date, location) adds a sense of urgency and realism.
  
- **Weaknesses**: While the stakes are high, the paragraph doesn't delve deeply into the emotional or physical toll on the characters, nor does it introduce any immediate, unexpected twists or obstacles. The suspense is more about the outcome than the unfolding events.

Overall, it’s suspenseful but could be heightened with more immediate tension or unexpected developments.
