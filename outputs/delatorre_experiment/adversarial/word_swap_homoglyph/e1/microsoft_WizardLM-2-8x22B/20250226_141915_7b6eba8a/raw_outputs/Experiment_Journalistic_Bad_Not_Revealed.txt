This paragraph introduces a moment of relief and punctuality with the helicopter landing on time, which could momentarily reduce suspense. However, it also maintains a level of tension by reminding the reader that Robert Bent is in a "critical but stable condition," suggesting that while there has been a successful step in the process, the outcome is still uncertain. The specificity of the time (08:57) adds a sense of precision and urgency, which contributes to the suspense. The reader is likely to be interested in what happens next, particularly whether the organ will be successfully transplanted and if Robert's condition will improve. The suspense is present but not as heightened as in the previous paragraph, hence the mid-range score.

This paragraph adds a layer of suspense by focusing on the detail of the small blue fridge, which is an unusual and specific image, shaped like a case and containing the precious cargo of a fully functioning liver. The mention of two men descending from the helicopter with such a critical item creates a visual and tense moment, as the reader can imagine the care and urgency with which they must be handling the organ. The suspense arises from the anticipation of what could happen next: whether the liver will be safely transported to the operating room, any potential complications that could arise, and the ultimate fate of the liver and young Robert Bent. The specificity of the image and the importance of the task at hand contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere.

This paragraph introduces a new element of potential danger that could disrupt the critical situation unfolding at the hospital. The fact that the cleaner has just mopped the floor and left without placing a "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it sets the stage for a possible accident. The reader is likely to feel suspense because the scene is set for an unexpected complication that could interfere with the urgent delivery of the liver. The timing is crucial ("minutes earlier"), suggesting that the events are converging towards a critical point. The suspense is moderate because, while the reader anticipates a potential problem, the direct impact on the main storyline (the liver transplant) is not yet clear.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level because it directly connects the potential hazard (the recently mopped and unmarked wet floor in the service stairwell) with the critical action of the story (the two men transporting the liver). The decision to use the service stairwell, which the reader knows to be a risky path due to the wet floor, creates a sense of impending danger. The suspense arises from the anticipation of whether the men will encounter the slippery floor, potentially compromising the safety of the liver and the success of the transplant. The reader is left in suspense, worrying about the outcome of their decision to use the stairwell, which could lead to a critical moment in the story.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It depicts the immediate consequence of the dangerous situation set up in the previous paragraph, where the wet floor in the service stairwell posed a significant risk. The action of the man slipping and the case with the liver plunging down the stairs creates a dramatic and tense moment that the reader has been anticipating. The language used ("slipped," "plunged") emphasizes the suddenness and severity of the incident, which directly threatens the success of the transplant and the life of young Robert Bent. The reader is likely to be on the edge of their seat, concerned about the condition of the liver and the implications of this accident on the story's outcome. The suspense is high because the reader is left wondering about the immediate aftermath and the potential for a positive resolution despite this setback.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by detailing the immediate reactions following the accident in the stairwell. The colleague's urgent action to warn the doctors introduces a race against time, as every second could be critical for the success of the transplant. The other man's decision to stay with the case and ensure it is not mishandled adds to the tension, as the reader is aware of the potential damage that could have occurred to the liver. The phrase "which was not handled in any way until the doctors arrived" suggests that there is still hope for the liver to be intact and usable, but the uncertainty of its condition keeps the suspense level high. The reader is left in suspense, waiting to find out if the doctors will be able to salvage the situation and whether Robert Bent's life-saving transplant will proceed as planned.

This paragraph provides a moment of relief and resolution by indicating that the doctors have arrived promptly, which could reduce suspense to some extent. However, the brevity and lack of detail about the condition of the liver and the case leave the reader in a state of uncertainty. The word "promptly" suggests a swift response, which is positive, but the reader is still left wondering about the outcome of the accident and whether the liver is still viable for transplant. The suspense is moderate because while the doctors' arrival is a critical step in addressing the situation, the paragraph does not reveal the consequences of the fall or the status of the liver, thus maintaining a level of tension and anticipation for the reader.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The opening of the case by the doctors is a critical moment that the reader has been anticipating since the accident in the stairwell. The discovery that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured introduces a significant complication and potential disaster for the transplant procedure. The use of the word "ruptured" conveys a sense of damage and possible loss, which directly impacts the life of young Robert Bent. The reader is left with a cliffhanger, as the paragraph ends without revealing the condition of the liver itself or the implications for the transplant. The suspense is high because the reader is likely to be deeply concerned about the outcome and whether the doctors will find a way to overcome this new obstacle.

This paragraph sustains a high level of suspense by transitioning to the next crucial step in the process: assessing the condition of the liver. The specific mention of the hepatiϲ laboratory and the surgeon carrying out a biopsy adds a sense of urgency and medical precision to the situation. The reader is aware that the results of this biopsy are critical to determining whether the liver can still be used for the transplant. The suspense arises from the anticipation of the biopsy results and the tension surrounding the potential for a favorable or devastating outcome. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader engaged, waiting to learn the fate of the liver and, by extension, young Robert Bent, which is why it rates highly on the suspense scale.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It delivers a significant and dramatic turn of events by revealing the outcome of the biopsy: the liver has been damaged in the fall and cannot be used for the transplant. This news is a devastating blow to the hopes for Robert Bent's survival, and it represents a critical moment in the story. The use of phrases like "had not withstood the impact" and "it was impossible to use the organ" conveys a sense of finality and tragedy. The reader is left with a feeling of dread and urgency, as the situation has taken a turn for the worse. The suspense is high because the reader is now keenly aware of the dire circumstances and is likely to be deeply invested in how the characters will respond to this setback, what alternatives might be available, and whether there is any chance for a positive resolution.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful and emotionally impactful. It brings a tragic resolution to the story by confirming the death of Robert Bent, a consequence of the damaged liver that could not be transplanted. The specific time of death (21:26) adds a stark and somber detail to the finality of the event. The reader is likely to feel the weight of this outcome, especially after following the tense sequence of events leading up to this moment. The suspense is at its peak here because the paragraph not only confirms the worst-case scenario but also leaves the reader with the gravity of the situation, the sense of loss, and the unanswered questions about what might have been done differently to prevent this tragedy. The narrative has reached its conclusion, but the emotional impact and the contemplation of the circumstances that led to this point maintain a high level of suspense until the very end.
