This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a key moment in the timeline of events—the arrival of the helicopter with the donor organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival contribute to a sense of urgency and critical timing. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the situation is precarious, which can create a sense of anticipation in the reader about whether the transplant will proceed successfully. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually," which implies a degree of control and predictability in the situation.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense. The vivid description of the men emerging from the helicopter with the precious blue case against the backdrop of the still-turning rotors creates a cinematic and intense atmosphere. The specific detail about the temperature of the liver and its importance in maintaining organ viability adds to the stakes. The communication between the men, hindered by the noise and conveyed through gestures, emphasizes the urgency of the situation.

This paragraph introduces a new element—the cleaner and his routine—which initially seems unrelated to the urgent situation of Robert Bent's liver transplant. The description of the cleaner's mundane tasks and his preference for the more sociable corridor cleaning lowers the immediate suspense established in the previous paragraphs. However, the detail about the absence of "wet floor" signs could potentially foreshadow a complication, as it introduces a hazard that could impact the urgent delivery of the organ. This subtle hint of danger and the potential for an unforeseen obstacle maintain a low level of suspense. The reader may start to anticipate a problem that could arise from the wet floors, which keeps the tension alive, albeit more subtly than in the previous paragraphs.

This paragraph raises the suspense level by reintroducing the urgency of the situation and the potential for complications. The specific details about the layout of the hospital and the decision to use the stairs instead of waiting for the lift emphasize the need for speed and efficiency. The fact that the men are carrying a life-saving organ and are now choosing a faster, but perhaps less direct or familiar, route creates tension. The reader is likely to anticipate potential obstacles or delays that could occur in the stairwell, especially given the earlier mention of the cleaner and the absence of "wet floor" signs. The dialogue between the two men also adds to the realism and urgency of the scene, making the situation feel more immediate and the stakes higher. The suspense is built on the reader's awareness of the critical timing and the potential for unforeseen events to interfere with the successful delivery of the organ.
