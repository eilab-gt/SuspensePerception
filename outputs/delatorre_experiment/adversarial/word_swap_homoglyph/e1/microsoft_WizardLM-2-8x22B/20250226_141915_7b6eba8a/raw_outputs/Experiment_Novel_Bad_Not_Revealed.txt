The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the boy's critical condition and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait introduces a sense of urgency and tension. The specific details, such as the date and the name of the hospital and the boy, add to the realism and gravity of the situation, which in turn heightens the suspense. The reader is left wondering about the outcome, which is a classic element of suspenseful storytelling. However, as the paragraph is quite brief and serves as an introduction, the full extent of the suspense is yet to be developed in the subsequent narrative.

This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a pivotal moment in the story—the arrival of the organ via helicopter. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of precision and high stakes. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the situation is still precarious, maintaining tension. However, the suspense level is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the organ has arrived, which is a positive development in the narrative. The reader may anticipate that the next steps will be crucial, but the immediate peril seems to have passed, which can reduce the suspense compared to the previous paragraph.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the urgency of the situation as two men race against time to deliver a compatible liver for transplant. The imagery of the helicopter's rotors still turning, the men ducking and shouting over the noise, and the specific detail of the blue case maintaining the liver at a precise temperature all contribute to a palpable sense of tension. The inaudible shouting, the gesture to the watch, and the pointed direction towards the doorway all convey the critical nature of the timing. The final sentence, which reiterates the patient's dire condition and the need for haste, leaves the reader anxious about whether the team will be able to complete their task in time to save Robert's life. The suspense is heightened by the knowledge that every second counts in a situation like this.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful in the traditional sense. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine job of mopping the hospital's service stairwell, which lacks the elements of danger, uncertainty, or imminent threat that typically contribute to suspense. The cleaner's actions are described as mundane and uneventful, and there is a sense of normalcy and repetition in his daily tasks. The mention of the cleaner not using "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but this is a minor detail and does not directly relate to the urgent medical situation previously described. The paragraph serves more to establish setting and character rather than to build suspense. However, it does create a contrast between the everyday routine and the high-stakes drama unfolding elsewhere in the hospital, which could be used to heighten suspense if the narrative were to intersect these two scenarios in a significant way.

This paragraph builds a moderate level of suspense by detailing the specific path the men must take to deliver the liver to the patient. The description of the route through the service stairwell, the secondary corridor, and the mention of the east wing lift introduces a sense of procedural tension. The decision to avoid the lift due to time constraints and the choice to use the stairs instead adds to the urgency of the situation. The reader is aware that the patient is on the 6th floor, creating a mental countdown as the men navigate the hospital's interior. The suspense arises from the potential for delays or unforeseen obstacles that could arise in this detailed environment. However, the suspense is somewhat tempered by the calm and calculated decision-making of the characters, which suggests they are in control of the situation. The reader is left to wonder if their chosen path will indeed be the quickest and whether any unforeseen events will occur to hinder their progress.

The men holding their breath in horror emphasizes the gravity of the situation.
