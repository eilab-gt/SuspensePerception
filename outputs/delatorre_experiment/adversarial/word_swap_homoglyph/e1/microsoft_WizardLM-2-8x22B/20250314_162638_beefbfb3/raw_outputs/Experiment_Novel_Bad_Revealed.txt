The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene with a critical medical situation, the anticipation of a life-saving organ transplant, and the ticking clock of the boy's deteriorating condition. The specific details, such as the exact time of the boy's death and the mention of the organ's damage in transit, add to the tension and create a sense of tragic inevitability. However, the suspense is somewhat undercut by revealing the outcome in the first sentence, which may lessen the impact for some readers. Nonetheless, the narrative manages to maintain a high level of suspense by focusing on the unfolding events and the emotional stakes involved.

This paragraph has moderate suspense. It introduces a moment of high tension with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the life-saving organ, which is a critical point in the narrative. The specific mention of the time adds urgency, and the phrase "critical but stable condition" suggests that Robert Bent's situation is precariously balanced, heightening the stakes. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph is brief and does not delve into the complexities or potential complications that might arise. It sets the stage for a suspenseful event but does not, in itself, contain a dramatic arc or cliffhanger that would elevate the suspense to a higher level.

The specific mention of the liver being stored at a precise temperature to keep it viable adds to the gravity of the moment. The nod and the immediate action towards the doorway off the roof suggest that every second counts, which effectively builds suspense. The reader is left wondering if the team will make it in time and if the organ will be successfully transplanted, creating a strong sense of anticipation and concern for the outcome.

This paragraph has a low level of suspense. It provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine work, which, while setting a scene and providing context, does not inherently build tension or anticipation. The mundane nature of the job and the cleaner's casual approach to his tasks suggest a sense of normalcy rather than impending danger or dramatic events. The mention of the "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but this is not explicitly connected to any immediate threat or conflict, and thus the suspense remains minimal. The paragraph serves more as a character study and background information rather than a source of suspense.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, primarily because it states the outcome at the beginning, which undercuts the tension for the reader. Knowing the tragic conclusion beforehand means that the suspense is not about whether Robert Bent will survive, but rather how the events will unfold to reach that end. However, the specificity of the time of death and the mention of the damage to the organ in transit do create a sense of finality and inevitability that can be chilling. The paragraph serves as a somber resolution to the preceding tension, confirming the worst fears that have been building throughout the narrative. While it may not be suspenseful in the traditional sense, it carries the weight of the consequences that the suspense has been leading up to.
