The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the donor organ being found creates a sense of urgency, while the uncertainty of whether Robert will survive the wait introduces a significant element of suspense. The specific details, such as the date and the name of the hospital and the boy, add to the realism and gravity of the situation, which can make the reader feel more invested in the outcome. The open-ended conclusion of the paragraph, "This is the story of what happened," invites the reader to continue reading to discover the resolution, which is a classic technique to create suspense.

This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a pivotal moment in the story—the arrival of the helicopter with the life-saving organ. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of precision and high stakes. The detail that Robert Bent is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the situation is still precarious, maintaining tension. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the helicopter has landed "punctually," which implies a successful step in the process. The reader is left to wonder about the subsequent events, such as the surgery's outcome, which keeps the suspense alive but at a slightly lower level than if the paragraph had ended on a more uncertain note.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the critical moments as the men carrying the life-saving organ make their way from the helicopter to the hospital. The detailed imagery of the rotors still turning, the men's urgency, and the specific mention of the blue case containing the liver at the precise temperature necessary for its preservation all contribute to a palpable sense of tension. The communication difficulties due to the noise, the gesture to the watch emphasizing the urgency of the situation, and the reminder that the patient is in a critical state all serve to heighten the suspense. The reader is drawn into the immediacy of the scene, concerned about the potential for delays or complications, and eager to find out if the organ will reach its destination in time to save Robert's life.

This paragraph contains elements that contribute to a sense of foreboding rather than immediate suspense. The detailed description of the cleaner's routine in the service stairwell sets the scene and provides context, but it lacks the urgency or impending danger that typically drives suspense. The mention of the cleaner not using "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, which does introduce a slight level of suspense, as the reader might anticipate a problem related to the wet stairs. However, the overall tone of the paragraph is more about establishing the setting and characters rather than creating a sense of imminent peril or high stakes. The reader may sense that the cleaner's actions could be relevant to the unfolding story, but without a clear connection to the critical situation of Robert Bent, the suspense level remains relatively low.

This paragraph builds suspense by detailing the path the men must take to deliver the organ and the decision-making process that could impact the urgency of their mission. The specificity of the route—from the helipad through the service stairwell, the secondary corridor, and the consideration of using the east wing lift—creates a sense of tension as the reader is made aware of the potential for delays. The advice to avoid the lift due to time constraints adds to the urgency, emphasizing the critical nature of every second. The image of the man holding the bannister with one hand while carrying the precious cargo in the other evokes a sense of careful urgency. The reader is left wondering if the decision to take the stairs will prove to be the quickest route and whether any unforeseen obstacles will arise, thus maintaining a high level of suspense.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The sudden accident—the man slipping and twisting his ankle—introduces an immediate threat to the mission's success. The description of the case, which is crucial to Robert's survival, rolling down the stairs while the man struggles to regain his balance, creates a vivid and tense scene. The imagery of the case spinning and making a noise like "a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag" not only emphasizes the chaos of the moment but also the potential damage to the precious organ inside. The men's reaction, holding their breath in horror, mirrors the reader's own anxiety and concern for the outcome. The suspense is heightened by the question of whether the organ is still viable after such an incident and what this will mean for Robert's transplant.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense as it depicts the immediate aftermath of the case's fall. The caution exercised by the men when approaching the case, and the warning not to move it for fear of damage, underscores the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences for Robert Bent. The decision to call the doctors rather than handle the situation themselves adds to the tension, suggesting that the organ's integrity may have been compromised. The swift action of one man to alert the medical team, while the other stays behind to guard the case, creates a sense of urgency and anticipation. The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the organ and whether the medical team will be able to salvage the situation in time for the transplant. The detailed description of the man's careful descent and hurried journey through the hospital corridors keeps the reader engaged and anxious to learn the outcome.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful, focusing on the intense emotional and physical state of the injured man as he waits for the medical team to arrive. His determination to remain standing despite his pain, driven by a superstitious belief that his suffering is linked to the organ's condition, adds a layer of dramatic tension to the scene. The description of his grip on the bannister and the way he bears his weight on his injured foot creates a vivid image of his endurance and the high stakes of the moment. The arrival of the doctors, rushing up the stairs and immediately asking the man to move away from the case, heightens the suspense as the reader is on the cusp of finding out whether the organ has been damaged. The urgency and seriousness of the doctors' actions suggest that the situation is critical, keeping the reader fully engaged and eager to discover the outcome.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The detailed description of the doctor opening the case, combined with the ominous "click" when the handle is pressed, builds anticipation. The revelation that the outer case contains a "sort of small padded fridge" adds complexity to the situation, as it suggests additional layers of protection for the precious organ. The doctor's reaction, shaking his head after a brief look, is a powerful moment of suspense that suggests bad news. The confirmation that the fridge has been ruptured and that refrigerated air is escaping drives home the severity of the situation and the potential for disaster. The reader is left with a cliffhanger, as the full extent of the damage and its implications for Robert's transplant are not immediately clear. This creates a high level of tension and concern for the characters involved, making it a highly suspenseful moment in the narrative.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. It describes a critical and delicate medical procedure that will determine the fate of the liver and, by extension, the young patient's life. The detailed account of the organ's transfer to the hepatology laboratory and the initial signs that suggest the liver might still be viable create a sense of hope mixed with uncertainty. The focus on the surgeon's careful preparation for the biopsy, his nervousness due to the high stakes, and the precise nature of the task at hand (with the risk of irreparable damage from even a minor error) all contribute to a tense and gripping scene. The reader is acutely aware of the surgeon's pressure to perform perfectly under intense circumstances, which heightens the suspense. The paragraph effectively conveys the gravity of the situation and leaves the reader on edge, waiting to learn the outcome of the biopsy and its implications for Robert's transplant.

This paragraph maintains an extremely high level of suspense. The surgeon's meticulous and precise actions as he performs the biopsy, combined with the high stakes of the procedure, create a tense atmosphere. The description of the surgeon holding his breath, the absence of resistance when inserting the needle, and the careful extraction of the transparent liquid all contribute to the edge-of-your-seat feeling. The anticipation builds as the liquid is placed under the microscope for analysis, with the surgeon's physical reactions (pursing his lips, blinking) indicating the gravity of the moment. The passage of time is emphasized by the surgeon's need to blink several times and the "interminable half a minute" he spends examining the sample, which amplifies the suspense. The revelation that the organ's metabolic rate is cause for optimism and that it has not been damaged by the impact provides a moment of relief, but the surgeon's look of concern suggests that the situation is not yet fully resolved, keeping the reader fully engaged and eager to learn the final outcome.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution and relief, which naturally reduces the suspense level compared to the previous paragraphs. However, the suspense is still present due to the confirmation being withheld until the very end of the sentence. The specificity of the time ("21:26") and the detail that the liver was "newly transplanted" and is now functioning correctly create a moment of dramatic tension before the positive outcome is revealed. The mention of the potential damage that the liver sustained in transit serves as a reminder of the earlier incident, which adds to the suspense by highlighting the close call. The reader's anxiety about whether the organ would be viable is finally addressed, but the suspenseful journey to reach this point keeps the paragraph engaging and satisfying, albeit less suspenseful than those leading up to this conclusion.
