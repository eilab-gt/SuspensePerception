This paragraph contributes to the suspense by describing a pivotal moment in the story—the arrival of the organ via helicopter. The specific mention of the time (08:57) and the punctuality of the landing adds to the tension, as it suggests that every second counts in this race against time to save Robert Bent's life. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" maintains the suspense by indicating that while he is holding on, his situation is still precarious. The reader is likely to feel a sense of relief that the organ has arrived on time, but the suspense remains high because the outcome of the transplant is still uncertain. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader engaged, wondering what will happen next in this high-stakes scenario.

This paragraph adds a layer of suspense through the vivid imagery of two men descending from the helicopter with the precious cargo—a small blue fridge containing the liver. The specific description of the fridge as being "in the shape of a case" and the emphasis on the liver being "fully functioning" heightens the sense of importance and urgency surrounding the organ. The reader is likely to be holding their breath, aware that the safe delivery of this case is critical to the boy's survival. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the organ is described as fully functioning, which implies that, so far, everything is going according to plan. The suspensefulness of this paragraph is moderate to high, as the reader is keenly aware of the stakes and the potential for complications, yet there is no immediate threat or obstacle presented.

This paragraph introduces a new element of potential danger that could disrupt the critical mission of delivering the liver. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and failing to display a "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding; the reader anticipates that this oversight could lead to an accident, especially given the urgency and high stakes of the situation. The specific detail that this happened "minutes earlier" adds to the suspense by suggesting that the men carrying the liver might soon encounter the hazard. The suspensefulness of this paragraph is moderate because it sets up a possible obstacle without any immediate consequences, leaving the reader in suspense about whether this detail will become significant in the unfolding events.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level because it directly connects the previous detail about the wet floor with the immediate path of the two men transporting the life-saving liver. The decision to walk down the service stairwell, where the floor has just been mopped and could be dangerously slippery, introduces a clear and imminent threat to the mission's success. The reader is likely to feel a heightened sense of anxiety, knowing that an accident in this scenario could have catastrophic consequences for Robert Bent. The suspensefulness here is high due to the combination of the high-stakes situation and the introduced risk of an accident that could occur at any moment as the men descend the stairs.

This paragraph escalates the suspense to a very high level by depicting the immediate consequence of the previously established risk. The moment one of the men slips on the wet stairs, the reader's worst fears are realized, and the tension reaches a peak. The case containing the liver "plunging down the stairs" is a critical event that threatens the entire transplant operation and, by extension, Robert Bent's life. The vivid description of the accident creates a sense of urgency and leaves the reader on edge, unsure of the extent of the damage and the implications for the boy's survival. The suspensefulness is very high because the reader is now confronted with a worst-case scenario that has just unfolded, with the outcome still hanging in the balance.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by focusing on the immediate reactions following the accident. The colleague's urgent action to warn the doctors creates a sense of emergency, while the other man's cautious supervision of the case underscores the delicate nature of the situation. The specific instruction that the case was "not handled in any way" until the doctors arrived suggests that any mishandling could have serious consequences. The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the liver inside the case and whether the slip will result in a compromised organ, which in turn affects the life of Robert Bent. The suspensefulness remains high because the paragraph raises questions about the outcome and keeps the reader engaged, waiting to see if the transplant can proceed or if this incident will lead to a tragic turn of events.

This paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution, which slightly reduces the suspense from the previous high-tension moment. The prompt arrival of the doctors suggests that professional help is now on the scene to address the situation following the case's fall. While the reader knows that an incident occurred that could potentially jeopardize the transplant, the immediate response by the medical team implies that there is still hope for a positive outcome. The suspensefulness is moderate because the reader is left hanging on the doctors' assessment of the situation and the condition of the liver, but the imminent danger has been mitigated by the doctors' swift response. The paragraph serves as a transition, keeping the reader in suspense about what will happen next without heightening the tension further.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level by revealing a critical complication in the situation. The discovery that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured introduces a direct threat to the viability of the organ and, consequently, to the life of Robert Bent. The reader is likely to feel a surge of anxiety and concern, as this revelation suggests that all the previous efforts could be in vain. The suspensefulness is very high because the paragraph presents a worst-case scenario that directly impacts the central tension of the story—whether the boy will receive the life-saving transplant.

The mention of the "hepatic laboratory" and the specific action of "carrying out a biopsy" suggests a methodical and professional approach to dealing with the emergency. The reader is kept in suspense about the results of the biopsy and whether the liver is still viable for transplant. The suspensefulness is moderate because the paragraph implies that there is still a chance for a positive outcome, but the tension remains high due to the uncertainty of the organ's condition. The reader is left waiting for the outcome of the medical examination, which will determine the next crucial steps in the story.

However, there may still be residual suspense regarding the surgery's success and the boy's recovery, which could be explored in the continuation of the story.
