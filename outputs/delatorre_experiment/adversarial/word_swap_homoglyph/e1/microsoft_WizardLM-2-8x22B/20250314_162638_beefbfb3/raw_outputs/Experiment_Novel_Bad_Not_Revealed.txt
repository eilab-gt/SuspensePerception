The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the boy's critical condition and the urgency of the situation (his survival being uncertain) creates a sense of tension and concern for the outcome. The specific details, such as the date and the name of the hospital and the boy, add to the realism and gravity of the situation, which in turn heightens the suspense. The reader is left wondering whether the liver will arrive in time and if Robert will survive, which are strong hooks for suspense. However, without further development of the story, the suspense is somewhat limited, hence the rating of 7, indicating a good level of suspense but with room for the tension to escalate as the story unfolds.

This paragraph adds to the suspense by providing a critical update on the situation with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the liver. The specific time given, along with the mention of the organ's arrival, creates a sense of urgency and relief that the liver has arrived on time. However, the phrase "critical but stable condition" introduces an element of uncertainty about Robert's fate, maintaining some level of suspense. The reader is likely to feel a mix of hope and anxiety, not knowing whether the transplant will be successful or if there will be complications. The suspense is present but not as intense as it could be if further complications or obstacles were introduced. Therefore, on the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 6 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph significantly heightens the suspense. The vivid description of the men descending from the helicopter with the precious blue case, the urgency conveyed by their actions, and the knowledge that the patient is in a critical situation all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The specific details, such as the temperature of the case and the men's awareness of the limited time, add to the realism and gravity of the moment. The noise of the helicopter blades, which necessitates non-verbal communication, and the focus on the passage of time with the mention of the watch, create a palpable sense of pressure and haste. The reader is drawn into the immediacy of the situation, feeling the weight of each second as the men rush to deliver the liver. The suspense is strong here, as the reader is left to wonder if every action is being executed perfectly to ensure the organ reaches its destination in time to save Robert's life. This paragraph would rate around an 8 on the suspensefulness scale.

This paragraph does not generate a high level of suspense, especially when compared to the previous ones that dealt directly with the urgent medical situation. The description of the cleaner's routine provides context and a sense of normalcy within the hospital setting, which serves to contrast with the high-stakes drama unfolding elsewhere. The mundane nature of the cleaner's job and his relaxed demeanor, indicated by his whistling and lack of urgency, do not contribute to a sense of tension or impending danger. The mention of the "wet floor" signs not being used could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but this is a minor detail that does not directly relate to the critical situation with Robert Bent. Overall, the paragraph is more about setting the scene and providing background information rather than building suspense. On the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 3 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph introduces a potential obstacle in the urgent delivery of the liver, which contributes to a moderate level of suspense.

The advice to avoid the elevator and use the stairs instead due to time constraints adds a layer of tension, as the reader is aware of the critical nature of the task at hand. The physical action of one man stopping the other from entering the corridor and the subsequent discussion about the best way to reach the patient on the 6th floor engage the reader's concern for efficiency and the successful outcome of the transplant. While there is a sense of urgency, the paragraph does not present an immediate threat or complication, which keeps the suspense level somewhat contained. On the 9-point scale, this paragraph would rate around a 5 for suspensefulness.
