This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a critical moment in the story—the arrival of the life-saving organ via helicopter. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of urgency and precision that is often associated with high-stakes medical situations. The reader is likely to feel a mix of relief that the organ has arrived and tension about what will happen next, especially given Robert's "critical but stable" condition.

This paragraph contributes to the suspense by focusing on the detail of the small blue fridge, which is an unconventional and perhaps unexpected container for such a vital and delicate organ as a liver. The image of the fridge, shaped like a case and being carefully carried by one of the men, emphasizes the preciousness of its contents and the meticulous care required to transport it. The reader is likely to be engaged, curious about the condition of the liver inside the fridge and whether it will successfully reach its destination in time for the transplant. The suspense is moderate because the narrative has not yet reached a climax, but the careful description of the process keeps the tension alive.

This paragraph introduces an element of suspense by hinting at a potential hazard that could have unforeseen consequences. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and leaving without placing a "wet floor" sign suggests the possibility of an accident occurring, especially in a high-stakes environment like a hospital where quick and safe movement is crucial. The reader is likely to anticipate a complication arising from this oversight, which adds a layer of tension to the narrative. However, the suspense level is moderate because the immediate impact of this detail is not yet clear, and the reader is left to speculate on how it might affect the unfolding events.

This paragraph introduces a sense of suspense by leading the two men transporting the liver into a potential hazard zone—the service stairwell that was previously mentioned as having a wet floor without a warning sign. The decision to use the stairwell rather than a safer, alternative route raises the stakes and creates anticipation in the reader's mind about the possibility of an accident or delay that could jeopardize the transplant process. The specific choice of the stairwell as the path for such a critical journey adds tension, as the reader is aware of the unmarked wet floor, which the characters are not. This creates a classic dramatic irony scenario, where the audience knows more than the characters, heightening the suspense.

The description of the event is vivid and immediate, which heightens the sense of urgency and peril. The reader is likely to feel a sharp increase in suspense, as the incident threatens the success of the transplant and the well-being of the characters involved, especially considering the life-saving importance of the organ they are transporting.

This paragraph heightens the suspense by revealing a significant complication in the transplant process—the rupture of the interior bag containing the liver. The moment of discovery, as the doctors open the case, is a critical point in the narrative that the reader has been anticipating since the case's fall down the stairs. The rupture introduces a direct threat to the viability of the organ and, by extension, to the life of the young patient awaiting the transplant. The reader is left on edge, as the paragraph raises immediate questions about the condition of the liver and the potential consequences for the surgery. The suspense is high, as this event could mark a turning point in the story, leading to either a resolution or further complications.

This paragraph sustains the suspense by transitioning to the next crucial step in assessing the situation—performing a biopsy on the liver to determine its condition. The specific mention of the hepatic laboratory as the setting for this examination adds a sense of medical authenticity and urgency. The surgeon's direct involvement in conducting the biopsy underscores the importance of the procedure and the gravity of the situation. The reader is likely to feel a heightened sense of anticipation and concern, as the outcome of the biopsy will significantly impact the transplant's feasibility and the patient's prognosis.

This paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution, which slightly reduces the suspense level from the peak reached in the previous paragraphs. Learning that the liver has withstood the impact and is viable for the transplant offers a positive turn in the narrative, which the reader has been anxiously awaiting. However, the use of the word "possible" introduces a note of caution, suggesting that while the organ is suitable for transplant, there may still be risks or uncertainties ahead. The reader's concern shifts from the viability of the liver to the success of the transplant surgery itself. The suspense is moderate, as the narrative moves toward a hopeful conclusion, but the potential for complications during the actual procedure keeps the tension alive.

This paragraph brings a significant measure of closure to the narrative, confirming that Robert Bent's liver transplant has been successful and that the organ was not adversely affected by the earlier mishap. The specificity of the time (21:26) adds to the authenticity of the scenario and marks the moment of triumph after a day filled with tension and uncertainty. While the reader may feel relief and satisfaction at this positive outcome, the suspense level is relatively low compared to the preceding events because the primary conflict has been resolved. However, the mention of the damage the liver sustained in transit and its ultimate functionality does provide a final note of tension, acknowledging the close call and the potential for complications that was narrowly avoided.
