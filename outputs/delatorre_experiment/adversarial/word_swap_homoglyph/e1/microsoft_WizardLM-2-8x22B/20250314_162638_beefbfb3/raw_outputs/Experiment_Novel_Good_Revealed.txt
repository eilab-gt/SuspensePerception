This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine job of mopping the service stairwell in a hospital. The narrative is more focused on the cleaner's work habits, his preferences for cleaning different areas, and his interactions with hospital staff and patients. The mention of the "wet floor" signs not being used adds a slight element of potential risk, but there is no immediate threat or sense of danger presented. The paragraph lacks a clear indication of an impending critical event or a direct connection to a high-stakes situation, which are typically necessary to build suspense. It sets a scene and provides background information, but on its own, it does not create a strong sense of suspense.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution rather than suspense. It confirms that Robert Bent's liver transplant was successful and that the organ was not adversely affected by the earlier mishap. While the specific time stamp (21:26) and the mention of the medical team's verification add a degree of seriousness and finality to the situation, the paragraph serves more as a conclusion to the preceding tension rather than creating new suspense. The reader's anxiety about the outcome is alleviated by the positive news, which means that the suspenseful arc of the story has been resolved. Therefore, on the suspense scale, this paragraph would rate lower, as it brings closure to the suspense rather than heightening it.
