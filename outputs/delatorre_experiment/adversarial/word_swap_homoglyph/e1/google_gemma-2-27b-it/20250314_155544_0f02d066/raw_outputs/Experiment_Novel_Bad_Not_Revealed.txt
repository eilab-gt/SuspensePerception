I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a critical liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival creates tension.
* **Ticking Clock:** The reference to waiting since 8 a.m. adds a sense of urgency.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, there's no immediate, tangible threat or danger presented in this paragraph.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("were all ready," "were awaiting") slightly diminishes the sense of immediacy and action.

Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a suspenseful story but doesn't deliver a strong punch of suspense itself.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Punctuality Creates Tension:** The precise time (08:57) and the word "punctually" create a sense of anticipation and build-up. We know something important is about to happen.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Action and Urgency:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, the mention of the spinning blades, and the urgency conveyed through their actions create a sense of fast-paced tension.
* **High Stakes:** The emphasis on the liver's temperature and functionality, along with the reminder that the patient is in a critical situation, raises the stakes and highlights the importance of speed.

* **Limited Information:** We don't know what the inaudible shout was about, adding a layer of mystery and leaving the reader wondering what potential obstacles might arise.

**Overall:** This paragraph effectively builds suspense through its vivid imagery, fast-paced action, and the underlying sense of urgency and danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Relief and New Tension:** The case stopping safely provides a brief moment of relief, but the uncertainty about potential damage introduces a new layer of tension.
* **Cautious Approach:** The men's decision to call the doctors and their careful handling of the situation highlight the seriousness of the situation and maintain a sense of suspense.
* **Shift in Focus:** The paragraph shifts focus to the man going to alert the doctors, which slightly diminishes the immediate suspense surrounding the case itself.

* **Resolved Threat:** The primary threat (the case falling) has been resolved, and the new tension is more subtle and less immediate.

Overall, this paragraph maintains a sense of suspense through the uncertainty about the case's condition and the cautious approach of the men, but the shift in focus and the reduced immediacy lower the overall suspense level.
