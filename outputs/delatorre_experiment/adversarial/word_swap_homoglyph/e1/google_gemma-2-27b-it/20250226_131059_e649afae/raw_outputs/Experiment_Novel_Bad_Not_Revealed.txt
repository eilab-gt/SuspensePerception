* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("were all ready," "were awaiting") slightly diminishes the sense of urgency.

Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a suspenseful story but doesn't quite reach a high level of tension yet.

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and implies a race against time.
