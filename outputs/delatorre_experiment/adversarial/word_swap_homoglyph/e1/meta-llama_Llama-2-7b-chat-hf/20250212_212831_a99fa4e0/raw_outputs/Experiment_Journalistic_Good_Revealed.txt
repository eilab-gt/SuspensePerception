  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The time frame of the event is established, which adds a sense of urgency and tension.
2. The use of the word "punctually" to describe the helicopter's landing creates a sense of precision and control, which could be seen as a positive or negative development depending on the context.

However, the paragraph does not provide much new information or create any significant tension, which is why I would rate it as a 4 rather than a 9. The reader is already aware that the organ has been found and is on its way to the hospital, so there is not much suspense built up around the landing of the helicopter. Additionally, the description of Robert's condition is relatively neutral, without any indication of how critical it really is, which reduces the overall tension in the paragraph.
