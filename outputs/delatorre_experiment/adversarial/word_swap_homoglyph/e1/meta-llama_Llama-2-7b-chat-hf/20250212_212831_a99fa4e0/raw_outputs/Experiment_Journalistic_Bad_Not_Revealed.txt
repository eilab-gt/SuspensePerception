  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

3. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before adds to the suspense, as it suggests that Robert's fate is still uncertain.
4. The phrase "However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of doubt and uncertainty, which adds to the suspense.

However, there are a few things that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite straightforward and doesn't use any particularly suspenseful language or techniques.
2. The situation is described in a relatively matter-of-fact way, which takes away from the sense of tension and uncertainty.

Overall, while the paragraph sets up a compelling situation, it could benefit from more suspenseful language and techniques to really ratchet up the tension and keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
