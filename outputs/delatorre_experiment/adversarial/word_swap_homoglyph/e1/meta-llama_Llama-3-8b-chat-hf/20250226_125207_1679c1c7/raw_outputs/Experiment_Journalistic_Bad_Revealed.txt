I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by setting the scene for a potentially life-or-death situation, introducing a sense of urgency with the mention of a critical condition and a waiting period for a liver transplant. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the medical team's certification of Robert's death, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more intense.

However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it included more dramatic language or hints at the consequences of Robert's death. For example, the paragraph could describe the emotional impact on Robert's family or the medical team, or it could hint at the potential consequences of the failed transplant for Robert's future. Additionally, the paragraph could benefit from a more dramatic or unexpected twist to keep the reader engaged. As it stands, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the sense of urgency and tragedy, but it could be even more effective with a few more suspenseful elements.
