I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the protagonist's life hanging in the balance. The use of specific details, such as the time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the situation feel more immediate. However, the paragraph is still relatively straightforward and doesn't have any major plot twists or surprises, which prevents it from being more suspenseful. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which also reduces the sense of tension and suspense.
