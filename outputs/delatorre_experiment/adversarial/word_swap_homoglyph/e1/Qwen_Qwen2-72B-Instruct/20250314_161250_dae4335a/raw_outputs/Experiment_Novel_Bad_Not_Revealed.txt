The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear time pressure and uncertainty about the outcome. The use of specific details, such as the location, date, and the patient's name, adds to the realism and tension. The uncertainty about whether the patient will survive the wait for the transplant creates a sense of impending danger and the need for a resolution. Therefore, I would rate it a 7 on the 9-point scale.

The fact that he is bearing his weight on his injured foot and is in pain adds to the tension by emphasizing the physical and emotional toll of the situation. The mention of the man's superstitious belief that the condition of the liver in some way depends on the suffering he is capable of offering in exchange adds to the sense of uncertainty and danger by suggesting that the outcome of the situation is not entirely within the control of the medical team.
