 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The setting in a children's hospital and the critical condition of the young boy create an immediate sense of tension. The anticipation of the liver transplant and the uncertainty about its outcome, as well as the impending death of the boy, contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. The fact that the story is based on a real event also adds to the sense of urgency and gravity. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the events leading up to the transplant and the emotions of the characters involved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. The landing of the helicopter is an important event in the story, but it does not create a significant sense of tension or uncertainty on its own. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ and its importance, or about the emotions of the medical team as they await its arrival. Additionally, a more dramatic or ominous tone could be used to build anticipation and create a more suspenseful atmosphere.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 2 on the suspensefulness scale. The description of the cleaner's routine and the mundane details of his job do not create a sense of tension or uncertainty. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the hospital or the events that are about to take place, or if it hinted at some sort of connection between the cleaner and the events that are about to unfold. Additionally, a more dramatic or ominous tone could be used to build anticipation and create a more suspenseful atmosphere.  However, the paragraph serves as a contrast to the urgency of the liver transplant and the tension surrounding it, and it helps to establish the normalcy of the hospital before the events take a turn.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. The description of the layout of the hospital and the instructions given to the men carrying the liver add to the sense of urgency and the need for quick decision-making. The fact that the patient is on the 6th floor and the men decide to take the stairs instead of the lift creates a sense of tension and urgency. The use of the phrase "it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors" also emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the need for the men to act quickly. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the patient's condition and the consequences of not performing the transplant in time. Additionally, a more dramatic or ominous tone could be used to build anticipation and create a more suspenseful atmosphere.  ​  ​
