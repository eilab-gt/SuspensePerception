 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant for an eight-year-old boy, and the uncertainty of his survival while waiting for the organ.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. While the arrival of the organ is an important development in the story, it does not necessarily add to the suspense or tension as it is expected and happens as planned.

However, the use of the phrase "punctually" suggests that the arrival of the organ is significant and timely, which could add a slight sense of relief and anticipation.

However, the paragraph does not provide any new information or unexpected developments that would significantly increase the suspense.  The paragraph is more descriptive and informative rather than suspenseful.  However, the use of the phrase "small blue fridge" could add a slight sense of mystery and intrigue, as it is not a typical object one would associate with a liver transplant.

The paragraph is more descriptive and informative rather than suspenseful.  However, the paragraph could potentially add a sense of foreshadowing or irony, as the cleaner's negligence in not displaying the "wet floor" sign could potentially lead to a slip or accident that could impact the transplant. But this is not explicitly stated in the paragraph and is left to the reader's interpretation.  The paragraph is more of a background detail that sets the scene rather than a suspenseful moment in the story.  However, the use of the phrase "minutes earlier" could add a slight sense of urgency and tension, as it suggests that the cleaner's actions could have consequences that are about to unfold.
