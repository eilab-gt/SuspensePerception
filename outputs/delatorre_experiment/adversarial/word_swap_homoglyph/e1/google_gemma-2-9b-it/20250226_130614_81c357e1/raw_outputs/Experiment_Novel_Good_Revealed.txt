I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a critical situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the liver transplant creates a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Tension:**  However, the paragraph lacks real tension-building elements. We know the outcome (the liver functions correctly), so there's no real sense of doubt or fear for Robert's survival. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the situation rather than showing us the emotional turmoil or the medical drama.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his fear, his hopes, his pain.
* **Highlight the risks:** Emphasize the potential complications of the transplant.
* **Create uncertainty:**  Leave the outcome ambiguous for longer, making the reader wonder if the transplant will be successful.
