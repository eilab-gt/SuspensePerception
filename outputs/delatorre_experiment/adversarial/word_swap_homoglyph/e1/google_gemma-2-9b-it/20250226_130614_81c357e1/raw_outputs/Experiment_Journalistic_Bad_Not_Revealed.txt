I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by claiming it's a true story and sets a serious tone.
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child in critical condition awaiting a life-saving transplant. This creates immediate tension.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of "since 8 a.m." and the uncertainty of Robert's survival while waiting for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Concrete Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a specific, immediate threat presented. We don't know what could go wrong or who might be in danger besides Robert.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* Hint at a potential complication or obstacle in the transplant process.
* Introduce a conflicting character or decision that adds complexity.
* Use more vivid language to describe Robert's condition and the emotional weight of the situation.
