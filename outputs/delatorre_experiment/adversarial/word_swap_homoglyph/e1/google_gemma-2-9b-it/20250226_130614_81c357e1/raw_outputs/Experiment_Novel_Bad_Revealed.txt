Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph focuses on a mundane, uneventful task. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or anything that would make the reader feel on edge.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a definitive conclusion to the story, which inherently reduces the suspense. We already know the organ was damaged, so the confirmation of Robert's death feels more like a tragic outcome than a suspenseful twist.
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** While the information is significant, the paragraph lacks emotional depth. We don't get a sense of the team's grief, Robert's family's reaction, or the weight of the situation.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph simply states the facts without using vivid language or imagery to engage the reader emotionally.

**What could be improved:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the death, describe the scene: the somber atmosphere, the team's expressions, the silence in the room.
* **Internal Monologue:**  Include a brief thought from one of the medical professionals, expressing their sadness, frustration, or sense of failure.
* **Connect to Previous Events:**  Tie the paragraph back to the earlier suspenseful moments, highlighting the tragedy of the situation and the impact of the organ's damage.



While the paragraph delivers the necessary information, it lacks the emotional punch and suspenseful elements that would make it truly impactful.
