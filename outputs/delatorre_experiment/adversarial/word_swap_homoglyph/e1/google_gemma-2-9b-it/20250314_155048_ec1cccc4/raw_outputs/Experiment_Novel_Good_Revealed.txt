I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a critical situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the liver transplant creates a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Tension:**  However, the paragraph lacks real tension-building elements. We know the outcome (the liver functions correctly), so there's no real sense of doubt or fear for Robert's survival. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the situation rather than showing us the emotional turmoil or the medical drama.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his fear, his hopes, his pain.
* **Highlight the risks:** Emphasize the potential complications of the transplant.
* **Create uncertainty:**  Leave the outcome ambiguous for longer, making the reader wonder if the transplant will be successful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Time Sensitivity:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Critical Condition:**  The phrase "critical but stable" adds a layer of tension, suggesting that Robert's condition is precarious.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful nature of the cleaner's job. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or conflict.
* **Lack of Tension:**  The language is very descriptive but lacks any elements that would create suspense. We know exactly what's happening and there are no surprises or unexpected turns.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Introduce a Disruption:**  Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, or there's a sudden noise or disturbance.
* **Hint at a Hidden Threat:**  The cleaner could notice something out of place, or there could be a sense of unease or danger in the air.
