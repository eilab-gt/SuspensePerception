I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a real-life event and a critical situation, but it doesn't quite deliver a punch. The language is straightforward and lacks vivid descriptions or dramatic flair, which might make the story more engaging and suspenseful. Additionally, the paragraph doesn't reveal much about the event itself, leaving the reader wondering what happened, which could be a good thing for building suspense. However, the lack of a clear hook or a sense of urgency makes the paragraph feel more informative than suspenseful.
