I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The introduction of a critical situation, with a child's life hanging in the balance, creates a sense of urgency and tension.
* The use of specific details, such as the exact time and date, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The twist at the end, where the child dies despite the medical team's efforts, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that creates a sense of surprise and tragedy.
* However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly. Additionally, the writing could be more descriptive and evocative to create a more immersive experience for the reader.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys a sense of suspense and tragedy, but could benefit from a few tweaks to make it even more engaging and suspenseful.
