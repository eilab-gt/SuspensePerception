I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The introduction of a critical situation, with a child's life hanging in the balance, creates a sense of urgency and tension.

* The twist at the end, where the child dies despite the medical team's efforts, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that creates a sense of surprise and disappointment.
* However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it built up the tension and anticipation more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly. Additionally, the writing could be more descriptive and evocative to create a more immersive experience for the reader.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys a sense of suspense, but it could be even more effective with some additional attention to pacing and descriptive language.
