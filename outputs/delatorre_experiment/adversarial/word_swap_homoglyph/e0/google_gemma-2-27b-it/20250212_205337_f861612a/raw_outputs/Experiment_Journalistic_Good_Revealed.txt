However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right at the end of the paragraph. This removes much of the suspense.
* **The language is relatively straightforward:** There's not much use of vivid imagery or sensory details to heighten the tension.


To make it more suspenseful, you could:
