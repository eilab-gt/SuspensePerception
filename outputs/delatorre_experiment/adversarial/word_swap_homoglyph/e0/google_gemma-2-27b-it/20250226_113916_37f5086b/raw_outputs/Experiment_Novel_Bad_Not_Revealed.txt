I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a critical liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival creates tension.
* **Limited Information:** The paragraph withholds key details, like the nature of the complications and the specific challenges faced, leaving the reader wanting to know more.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, there's no immediate, pressing danger described. The suspense is more of a slow burn.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("were all ready," "were awaiting") slightly diminishes the sense of urgency.

Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a suspenseful story but doesn't deliver a strong punch of immediate tension.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and implies a race against time.
