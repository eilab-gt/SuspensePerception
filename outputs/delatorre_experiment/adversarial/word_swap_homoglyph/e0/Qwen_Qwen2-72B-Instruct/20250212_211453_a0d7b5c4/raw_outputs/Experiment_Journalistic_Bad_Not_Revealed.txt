The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear time frame and a life-or-death outcome. The uncertainty about whether the boy will survive the wait for the organ adds to the tension. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. The reason it's not higher is that it doesn't contain any unexpected twists or cliffhangers, and it's presented in a straightforward, factual manner. However, the life-threatening situation and the ticking clock create a sense of urgency and anticipation.
