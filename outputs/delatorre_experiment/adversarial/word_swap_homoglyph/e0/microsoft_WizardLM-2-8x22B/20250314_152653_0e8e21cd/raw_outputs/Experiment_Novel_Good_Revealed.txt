This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a specific, time-sensitive event—the landing of a helicopter carrying the much-needed organ for Robert Bent's transplant. The precision of the time (08:57) and the mention of the critical but stable condition of the patient contribute to a sense of urgency. The reader is likely to feel a buildup of tension as the arrival of the organ is a crucial turning point in the story. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually," suggesting that things are going according to plan, which may reduce the sense of unpredictability and danger typically associated with high suspense.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the intense and time-sensitive scenario of the organ delivery, with the rotors still turning and the men moving quickly and with purpose. The blue case is a focal point, and the detail about the liver being stored at a precise temperature to keep it functioning adds to the gravity of the situation. The inaudible shouting and the non-verbal communication between the men emphasize the urgency and the chaotic environment of the helicopter landing. The nod and the immediate movement towards the exit underscore the critical nature of the patient's condition and the need for haste. The reader is left in suspense about whether the team will make it in time and whether the liver will be viable for the transplant, creating a strong sense of anticipation and concern for the outcome.

This paragraph has a lower level of suspense compared to the previous ones. It provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine work in the hospital, which contrasts with the high-stakes drama of the organ transplant scenario. While the narrative is calm and mundane, it does introduce elements that could potentially lead to suspense, such as the absence of "wet floor" signs in the service stairwell, which could imply a future incident or complication. The mention of the cleaner's habits and the specifics of his routine create a sense of normalcy that is at odds with the tension in the rest of the story, but the reader may sense an impending disruption to this routine given the context of the situation with Robert Bent. The suspense here is subtle and more about foreshadowing rather than immediate danger or urgency.

This paragraph builds suspense by detailing the path the men must take to deliver the liver to Robert Bent. The specificity of the route—through the service stairwell, past the central archives and storeroom, and the mention of the doctors' rooms and the east wing lift—creates a vivid mental image of the setting and the journey ahead. The decision to use the stairs instead of the lift introduces a sense of urgency and a strategic choice to save time, emphasizing the critical nature of their mission. The reader is likely to feel tension as the characters navigate through the hospital's less-traveled areas, aware that any delay could have serious consequences. The suspense is heightened by the fact that the reader is privy to the urgency of the situation, creating a sense of anticipation for potential obstacles or complications that could arise as the men make their way to the 6th floor.

This paragraph reaches a near maximum level of suspense. It describes a pivotal moment in the story where the viability of the liver for transplantation is being assessed through a delicate and high-stakes procedure. The detailed account of the liver's examination, the mention of enzyme activity, and the emphasis on the metabolic rate all contribute to the tension, as these factors will determine the organ's suitability for the transplant. The atmosphere is further charged by the description of the biopsy process, with the surgeon's nervousness and the gravity of the situation palpable. The precision required—a clean puncture with the risk of irreparable damage from even a one-millimeter mistake—underscores the critical nature of the procedure and the life-or-death stakes involved. The reader is left in suspense, acutely aware that the slightest error could have dire consequences for the young patient, Robert Bent, which heightens the emotional investment in the outcome.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense as it details the critical analysis of the liver tissue. The surgeon's careful insertion of the needle and the relief at not encountering resistance build tension, as does the precise description of the transparent liquid being drawn into the syringe. The atmosphere is tense as the liquid is placed on a Petri dish and examined under a microscope, with the surgeon's facial expressions—pursing his lips and blinking—suggesting deep concentration and perhaps some concern. The passage of time is emphasized by the surgeon's repeated actions and the "interminable half a minute," which heightens the reader's anticipation. The revelation that the organ's metabolic rate is cause for optimism and that it has not been damaged by the impact provides a moment of relief, but the surgeon's look of concern keeps the reader on edge, wondering about any unforeseen complications that might still arise. The suspense is sustained by the fact that the final outcome is not yet certain, and the stakes remain extremely high for the young patient awaiting the transplant.

This paragraph serves as a resolution to the suspense built up throughout the previous sections. It confirms that Robert Bent's liver transplant was successful and that the organ was not adversely affected by the earlier mishap during transit. While the confirmation of a positive outcome reduces the suspense, the paragraph still carries a moderate level of suspensefulness because it provides closure to the high-stakes situation that was previously described. The reader may feel a sense of relief and satisfaction in learning that the young patient's life is no longer in immediate danger. However, the suspense is significantly lower now that the critical moment has passed and the primary source of tension—the uncertainty of the transplant's success—has been resolved.
