The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene with a real event involving a life-or-death situation for a young boy, Robert Bent, who is in critical need of a liver transplant. The mention of the suitable donor found the day before and the anticipation of the organ's arrival creates a sense of urgency and a race against time. The specific details, such as the exact time of the boy's death, add to the gravity of the situation. However, the suspense is somewhat undercut by the revelation at the end that Robert Bent did not survive, which resolves the immediate tension but opens up questions about the circumstances surrounding his death and the damaged organ. The suspensefulness of this paragraph lies in the anticipation of the outcome and the tragic turn of events, despite the foreshadowing of the title indicating that the story will revolve around a death.

This paragraph introduces a potentially hazardous situation that significantly raises the suspense level. The reader is informed that the cleaner has just mopped the floor of a service stairwell, which is a critical pathway in a hospital, especially in an emergency situation involving the transport of an organ for transplant. The absence of a "wet floor" sign suggests the possibility of an accident or delay, which could have dire consequences for the boy awaiting the liver transplant. The timing of this event, occurring "minutes earlier," creates a sense of foreboding and imminent danger that the characters in the story are as yet unaware of. This sets up a scenario where the reader anticipates a possible collision of circumstances, heightening the suspense as one wonders how this oversight will impact the urgent delivery of the organ.
