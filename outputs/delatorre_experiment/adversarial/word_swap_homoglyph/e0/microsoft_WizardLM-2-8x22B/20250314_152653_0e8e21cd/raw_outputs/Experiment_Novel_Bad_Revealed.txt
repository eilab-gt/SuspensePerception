The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene with a critical medical situation, the anticipation of a life-saving organ transplant, and the ticking clock of the boy's deteriorating condition. The specific details, such as the exact time of the boy's death, add a sense of realism and urgency. The suspense is heightened by the mention of a suitable donor being found, which raises hope, only to be dashed by the tragic outcome. The open-ended conclusion with the promise of revealing "what happened" invites the reader to seek answers, contributing to the overall suspensefulness of the narrative. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the outcome is revealed in the paragraph itself, which is why it does not score a full 9.

This paragraph contains elements that contribute to suspense, such as the precise timing of the helicopter's landing and the critical but stable condition of Robert Bent. The mention of the organ's arrival by helicopter suggests a high-stakes situation and a race against time, which can be suspenseful. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph provides only a snapshot of the event without further development or complications that would heighten the tension. It sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful scenario but does not delve into any obstacles or uncertainties that might keep the reader on the edge of their seat. Therefore, while there is some inherent suspense in the situation described, the paragraph on its own does not reach the highest levels of suspensefulness.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful. It paints a vivid picture of the urgency and high stakes involved in the situation. The description of the men emerging from the helicopter with the precious blue case, the details of the organ's preservation, and the communication challenges due to the noise of the rotors all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The focus on non-verbal communication, the acknowledgment of the critical condition of the patient, and the emphasis on the limited time left, create a sense of urgency and impending crisis. The reader is drawn into the immediacy of the moment, wondering if the team will successfully navigate the time-sensitive situation. The paragraph effectively leaves the reader anticipating the outcome, making it highly suspenseful.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine work in the hospital, which, while descriptive and somewhat atmospheric, does not inherently build suspense. The mundane nature of the job and the cleaner's habits are described in a way that suggests normalcy rather than impending danger or tension. The mention of the "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but this is not explicitly connected to any immediate risk or conflict, and thus the suspense is minimal. The paragraph serves more to set a scene and introduce a character than to create a sense of suspense.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It builds tension through the detailed description of the path the men must take to deliver the organ, highlighting the complexity of the hospital's layout and the potential for delays. The decision to use the stairs instead of the elevator introduces a sense of urgency and the potential for unforeseen events, as the characters opt for a quicker but perhaps less predictable route. The specific mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the potential time saved by taking the stairs suggests that every second counts, which adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph does not yet present a clear obstacle or conflict that would significantly heighten the tension, hence it is in the middle range of the suspense scale.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense. The moment the case stops at the bottom of the stairs is a critical juncture, and the immediate reaction of the men to assess the situation contributes to the tension. The warning from one man to the other not to touch the case, suggesting potential damage to the organ, heightens the stakes and the sense of urgency. The division of tasks, with one man staying to guard the case and the other rushing to alert the medical team, creates a scenario where the reader is left with multiple points of tension: the condition of the organ, the potential reaction of hospital staff, and the outcome for the patient. The quick pace and the clear consequences of any delay or mishap make this paragraph quite suspenseful.

This paragraph sustains the suspense by focusing on the internal struggle of the man left alone with the case. His attempt to suppress thoughts of potential damage to the organ, his physical pain, and his superstitious belief that his endurance could somehow influence the organ's condition all contribute to a palpable sense of tension. The arrival of the doctors, urgently rushing to the scene, adds to the suspense as it signifies a critical moment in the narrative. The reader is kept on edge, waiting to find out if the organ is still viable for transplant, and the direct request from one of the doctors for the man to move away from the case suggests an immediate assessment is about to take place. The paragraph effectively maintains suspense by highlighting the gravity of the situation and the imminent revelation of the organ's fate.

The detailed account of the liver's transfer to the laboratory, the initial positive signs, and the reliance on the metabolic rate for a final assessment all contribute to the tension. The focus on the surgeon's precision required for the biopsy, his nervousness due to the high stakes, and the potential for irreversible damage with the slightest mistake, all serve to heighten the suspense.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful, as it delivers the tragic resolution to the narrative. The specific time of death given—21:26—conveys a sense of finality and underscores the urgency that was present throughout the story. The confirmation of Robert Bent's death, after the reader has been following the tense efforts to save him, is a powerful and emotional moment. The mention of the organ's damage during transit, which was the focus of the suspense in previous paragraphs, ties back to the central conflict and confirms the worst fears of the characters and the reader. While the paragraph itself is a stark conclusion rather than a moment of ongoing tension, it is suspenseful in the context of the entire narrative, as it represents the culmination of the suspense built up throughout the story.
