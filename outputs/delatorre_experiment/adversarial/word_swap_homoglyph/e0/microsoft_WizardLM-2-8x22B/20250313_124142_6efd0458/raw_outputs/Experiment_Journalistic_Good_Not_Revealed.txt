This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event—the arrival of the helicopter with the organ—and emphasizes punctuality, which suggests that every second counts. The mention of Robert Bent being in a "critical but stable condition" keeps the reader aware of the precariousness of his situation. The specificity of the time and the action of landing on the hospital roof convey urgency and importance, which contributes to the suspense. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the organ has arrived, potentially resolving the immediate tension of whether it would arrive in time. The reader is left to wonder about the success of the transplant and Robert's fate, maintaining a level of suspense.

This paragraph introduces a moment of action with the arrival of the men from the helicopter and the visual of the small blue fridge, which is an unusual detail that piques interest. The fridge, described as being in the shape of a case and storing the fully functioning liver, is a focal point that adds to the suspense by serving as a tangible representation of the stakes involved—the life-saving organ that could determine Robert Bent's fate. The specificity of the fridge's appearance and its precious contents creates a sense of anticipation and underscores the importance of the moment. However, the suspense is moderate because the paragraph suggests that the transplant process is proceeding as planned, and there is no immediate threat or complication introduced that would heighten the tension significantly.

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could have implications for the unfolding events, specifically the urgency surrounding the liver transplant. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and leaving without placing a "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it suggests the possibility of an accident or delay that could jeopardize the critical timing of the organ delivery. The specific detail of the service stairwell being the location of the wet floor adds to the suspense by hinting at a location that might be used for quick and safe transport of the organ or movement of medical personnel. The reader is left to anticipate whether this oversight will lead to a complication, thus creating a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph raises the suspense level by directly connecting the two men transporting the life-saving liver with the potential hazard previously introduced—the wet floor in the service stairwell. The decision to use the stairwell for a quick descent, which is reasonable under the circumstances, increases the tension because it puts the men and the precious cargo they are carrying in proximity to the unmarked wet floor. The reader is aware of the danger that the characters are unknowingly heading towards, which creates suspense as it raises the question of whether an accident will occur and how it might affect the urgent transplant procedure. The specific mention of the doorway to the service stairwell heightens the anticipation of a possible incident, thus maintaining a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph provides a partial resolution to the suspense by revealing that the liver has withstood the impact and is potentially viable for transplantation. The relief associated with this positive development reduces the suspense level, as it suggests that the immediate crisis has been averted and the transplant may proceed as planned.
