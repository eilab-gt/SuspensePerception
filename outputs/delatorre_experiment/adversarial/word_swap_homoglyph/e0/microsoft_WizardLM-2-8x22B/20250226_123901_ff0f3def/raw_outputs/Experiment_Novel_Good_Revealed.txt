This paragraph has a low level of suspense. It provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine work in the hospital, which sets a mundane and ordinary tone. The description of the cleaner's tasks, his preferences for certain areas of the hospital, and his habitual behavior do not create a sense of imminent danger or tension. While the paragraph is rich in detail and character development, it lacks elements that would typically contribute to suspense, such as uncertainty, risk, or a sense that something significant is about to happen. The cleaner's omission of placing "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident, but this is not directly tied to any immediate threat or dramatic event, and thus the suspensefulness of the paragraph remains quite low.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution and relief, which naturally reduces the suspense compared to the preceding moments of uncertainty. Knowing that Robert Bent's liver is functioning correctly after the transplant is a positive outcome that the reader has been anticipating.

The reference to the potential damage that was fortunately avoided contributes to the lingering suspense by reminding the reader of what could have gone wrong. Overall, while the paragraph concludes a significant part of the story with a favorable outcome, it maintains some level of suspense by highlighting the successful resolution of a high-stakes situation.
