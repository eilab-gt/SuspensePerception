I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a critical situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the liver transplant creates a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Tension:**  However, the paragraph lacks real tension-building elements. We know the outcome (the liver functions correctly), so there's no real sense of doubt or fear for Robert's survival. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the situation rather than showing us the emotional turmoil or the medical drama.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his fear, his hopes, his pain.
* **Highlight the risks:** Emphasize the potential complications of the transplant.
* **Create uncertainty:**  Leave the outcome ambiguous for longer, making the reader wonder if the transplant will be successful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Time Sensitivity:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Critical Condition:**  The phrase "critical but stable" adds a layer of tension, suggesting that Robert's condition is precarious.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the details of Robert's condition or the potential complications of the transplant, leaving some room for the reader to imagine the worst.

However, it still lacks some elements to make it truly suspenseful:

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Show, don't tell:** Describe the frantic activity inside the hospital as the team prepares for the transplant.
* **Focus on a character's perspective:**  Give us a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of a doctor or nurse involved in the procedure.
* **Hint at potential dangers:**  Mention a complication that could arise during the transplant.

* **Build anticipation:**  The paragraph ends with the men moving towards the exit.  The next sentence could describe the scene inside the hospital, further heightening the tension.
