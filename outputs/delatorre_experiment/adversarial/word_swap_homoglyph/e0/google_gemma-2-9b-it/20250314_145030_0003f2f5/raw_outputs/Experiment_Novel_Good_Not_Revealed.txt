I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by stating it's a true story with high stakes (a life-or-death situation).
* **Clear Conflict:** The conflict is established: Robert needs a liver transplant urgently, and his survival is uncertain.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of "8 a.m." and the "imminent" transplant creates a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is dire, the paragraph doesn't present an immediate, tangible threat. We don't know what could go wrong during the wait.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* Hint at potential complications or obstacles.
* Introduce a character with conflicting motivations.
* Include sensory details that heighten the tension (e.g., the sound of beeping machines, Robert's labored breathing).

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the organ adds a sense of urgency and importance to the situation.
* **Specific Time:**  "08:57" creates a sense of immediacy and precision, making the moment feel significant.

* **External Threat:** There's no indication of anything going wrong with the organ or the transport.
* **Unanswered Questions:**  What happens next? Will the transplant be successful?

**To make it more suspenseful, consider:**

* **Limited Information:** We don't know the exact nature of Robert's critical condition, which leaves room for speculation and worry.

**To make it even more suspenseful, consider:**

* **External Threat:** Introduce a minor obstacle or complication, such as a sudden gust of wind or a malfunctioning piece of equipment.

Here's why:

* **Hinting at a Hidden Threat:**  Subtly suggest that something sinister might be lurking in the shadows.
