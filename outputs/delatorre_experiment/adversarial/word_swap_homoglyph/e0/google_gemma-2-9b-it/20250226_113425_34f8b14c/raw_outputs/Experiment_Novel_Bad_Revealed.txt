I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a definitive conclusion to the story, which inherently reduces suspense. We already know the organ was damaged, so the confirmation of Robert's death is more of a tragic outcome than a surprising twist.
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** While the information is significant, the paragraph lacks emotional depth. We don't get a sense of the team's grief or Robert's family's reaction, which could have heightened the impact.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the certification of death rather than showing us the emotional weight of the moment.

**What could be improved:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the death, describe the scene: the hushed atmosphere, the somber expressions on the medical team's faces, the silence in the room.
* **Internal Monologue:** Include a brief thought from one of the doctors or nurses, expressing their sadness, frustration, or sense of failure.
* **Connect to Previous Events:**  Briefly mention the efforts made to save Robert, highlighting the tragedy of the situation.



While the paragraph delivers the necessary information, it lacks the emotional punch and suspenseful build-up that would make it truly impactful.
