  - The uncertainty about whether Robert will survive the wait adds tension.  
  - The mention of a real event and specific details (date, location) lends credibility and immediacy.  

- **Weaknesses**:  
  - The suspense is somewhat diluted by the clinical tone and lack of immediate action or emotional depth.  
  - The paragraph feels more like an introduction than a fully developed suspenseful moment.  
  - There’s no immediate threat or countdown, which could heighten the tension further.  

Overall, it’s moderately suspenseful but could be more gripping with sharper pacing or more vivid details.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**:  
  - The mention of a helicopter landing with the organ adds a sense of urgency and importance.  
  - The fact that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" maintains some level of tension.

I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**:  
  - The description of the small blue fridge containing the liver adds a tangible, visual element to the scene.  
  - The focus on the liver as "fully functioning" emphasizes the importance of the moment.  

- **Weaknesses**:  
  - The paragraph is still quite matter-of-fact and lacks emotional or dramatic tension.  
  - There’s no sense of urgency, danger, or uncertainty—everything seems to be proceeding smoothly.

- **Strengths**:  
  - The omission of the "wet floor" sign introduces a potential hazard, creating a sense of foreboding.  
  - The timing ("minutes earlier") suggests that this detail could become relevant soon, building anticipation.  
  - The mundane nature of the detail (a cleaner mopping the floor) contrasts with the high-stakes context of the story, making it feel like a subtle but significant setup for trouble.  

- **Weaknesses**:  
  - The suspense is still somewhat indirect, as the paragraph doesn’t explicitly connect this detail to the main plot or characters.  
  - Without immediate consequences or action, the tension remains understated.
