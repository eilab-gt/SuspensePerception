 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale for its suspensefulness. The use of a real-life event, the imminent liver transplant, and the uncertainty about the patient's survival create a sense of tension and anticipation. The paragraph also provides a clear sense of urgency and stakes, which further enhances the suspense. The final sentence, "This is the story of what happened," also leaves the reader curious about what will unfold in the story.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for its suspensefulness. While the landing of the helicopter is an important event in the story, it does not create as much tension or anticipation as the previous paragraph. However, the use of the word "punctually" suggests that the arrival of the organ is timely and crucial, which adds a sense of urgency to the scene. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the organ's condition or the medical team's reaction to its arrival.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for its suspensefulness. While the description of the cleaner mopping the floor adds a sense of realism to the story, it does not create a significant amount of tension or anticipation. The lack of a "wet floor" sign could potentially lead to a slip and fall accident, but this is not the main focus of the story. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the consequences of the cleaner's actions or if it connected the cleaner's actions to the main plot in a more direct way. ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍

However, the paragraph does not provide enough details about the stairwell or the men's journey to create a significant amount of tension or anticipation.
