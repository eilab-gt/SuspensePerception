 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The use of specific details, such as the date, location, and the critical condition of the young boy, creates a sense of urgency and tension. The reader is immediately drawn into the story and is left wondering about the outcome of the liver transplant. The use of the phrase "what happened" also adds to the suspense, as it suggests that something unexpected or dramatic is about to unfold. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more hints about the unexpected events that may occur during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. While the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ is an important event in the story, it does not necessarily create a sense of suspense or tension. The use of the phrase "punctually" suggests that the arrival of the organ is expected and on time, which reduces the level of suspense. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included more details about the helicopter's journey, such as any obstacles or challenges it faced, or the emotions of the medical team as they awaited its arrival. Additionally, the paragraph could have ended with a cliffhanger, such as a sudden power outage or a problem with the organ, to create a sense of uncertainty and tension.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The arrival of the men and the small blue fridge containing the liver creates a sense of anticipation and tension, as the reader knows that the liver is crucial for Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "fully functioning" also adds to the suspense, as it suggests that the liver is in good condition and could potentially save Robert's life. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the men, such as their expressions or actions, or if it hinted at any potential problems with the liver. Additionally, the paragraph could have ended with a cliffhanger, such as a sudden interruption or a problem with the liver, to create a sense of uncertainty and tension.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. While the mention of the cleaner finishing mopping the floor and leaving without displaying the "wet floor" sign could potentially create a sense of tension, it does not necessarily contribute to the overall suspense of the story. The paragraph seems to be more of a tangential detail that does not directly relate to the main plot. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have been more closely tied to the main story, such as if the cleaner had accidentally left a wet spot on the floor that caused a problem during the liver transplant. Additionally, the paragraph could have ended with a cliffhanger, such as a character slipping on the wet floor, to create a sense of uncertainty and tension.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The men transporting the liver leaving the roof and deciding to walk down the service stairwell creates a sense of tension, as the reader wonders why they chose this route and what might happen along the way. However, the paragraph does not provide any specific details about the stairwell or any potential obstacles that the men might encounter, which reduces the level of suspense. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included more details about the stairwell, such as its condition or any potential dangers, or it could have hinted at a problem with the liver that requires the men to take a specific route. Additionally, the paragraph could have ended with a cliffhanger, such as a sudden power outage or a problem with the liver, to create a sense of uncertainty and tension.  ​

The sudden and unexpected event of the man slipping and the case plunging down the stairs creates a sense of shock and tension, as the reader wonders what will happen to the liver and whether it will be damaged. The use of the phrase "plunged down the stairs" also adds to the suspense, as it suggests a dramatic and potentially catastrophic event. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included more details about the aftermath of the accident, such as the reactions of the other man and the medical team, or the condition of the liver. Additionally, the paragraph could have ended with a cliffhanger, such as a question about the fate of the liver or the consequences of the accident, to create a sense of uncertainty and tension.  ​  ​

The use of the phrase "when they opened the case" also adds to the suspense, as it suggests a dramatic and potentially catastrophic event. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included more details about the condition of the liver and the doctors' reactions to the discovery, or it could have hinted at the consequences of the rupture.

     I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
