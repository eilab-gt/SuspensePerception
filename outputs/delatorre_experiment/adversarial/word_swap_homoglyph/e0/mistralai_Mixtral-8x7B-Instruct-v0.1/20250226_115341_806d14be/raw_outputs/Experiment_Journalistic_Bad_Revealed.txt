 I would rate the paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The sudden and tragic turn of events, in which the transplant is unable to be performed due to the damage sustained by the organ, adds to the suspense and leaves the reader wanting to know more about what happened. Overall, the paragraph does a good job of creating a sense of anticipation and unease.

Additionally, the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually" suggests that there were no unexpected delays or complications, which reduces the sense of tension.
