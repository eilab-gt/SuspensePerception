The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear time frame and a life-or-death outcome. The uncertainty about whether the boy will survive the wait for the organ adds to the tension. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. A score of 9 would be reserved for a paragraph with more intense and immediate danger or a more dramatic cliffhanger. Here, the suspense is more about the outcome of a medical procedure and the well-being of the patient, which is certainly suspenseful but not as intense as, for example, a scene where a character is in immediate danger from a violent event.
