The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear time pressure and uncertainty about the outcome. The use of specific details, such as the location, date, and the patient's name, adds to the realism and tension. The uncertainty about whether the patient will survive the wait for the transplant creates a sense of impending danger and the need for a resolution. Therefore, I would rate it a 7 on the 9-point scale.
