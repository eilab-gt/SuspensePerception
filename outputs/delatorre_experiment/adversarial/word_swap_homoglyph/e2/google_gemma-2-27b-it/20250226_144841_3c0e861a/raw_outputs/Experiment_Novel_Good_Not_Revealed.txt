I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines establish a sense of realism and importance by mentioning a real event and a specific location. This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a critical liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival creates tension and raises the stakes.
* **Ticking Clock:** The phrase "awaiting the arrival of the organ" introduces a sense of urgency and a ticking clock element.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, there isn't an immediate, tangible threat or danger presented in this paragraph. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph mostly tells us about the situation rather than showing us the emotions, actions, or sensory details that would heighten suspense.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his feelings, thoughts, or physical sensations as he waits.
* **Introduce a complication:** Hint at a potential obstacle or delay in the transplant process.
* **Use more vivid language:** Employ sensory details and strong verbs to create a more immersive and tense atmosphere.

Here's why:

* **Slight Tension:** The punctuality of the helicopter landing creates a small sense of anticipation. We know the organ has arrived, but the outcome is still uncertain.

* **Introduce a potential problem:** Hint at a complication with the organ or the transplant procedure.
