I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Hook:** The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention and piques curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a critical liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival creates tension.
* **Ticking Clock:** The reference to waiting since 8 a.m. adds a sense of urgency.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, there's no immediate, tangible threat or danger presented in this paragraph.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("were all ready," "were awaiting") slightly diminishes the sense of immediacy and action.

Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a suspenseful story but doesn't deliver a strong punch of suspense itself.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Punctuality Creates Tension:** The precise time (08:57) and the word "punctually" create a sense of anticipation and build-up. We know something important is about to happen.

Here's why:

* **Action and Urgency:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, the mention of the spinning blades, and the urgency conveyed through their actions create a sense of fast-paced tension.
* **High Stakes:** The emphasis on the liver's temperature and functionality, along with the reminder that the patient is in a critical situation, raises the stakes and highlights the importance of speed.

Here's why:

* **Rising Stakes:** The mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the urgency to avoid delays adds to the tension.

* **Subtle Foreshadowing:** The mention of the "service stairwell" and the fact that the cleaner didn't put up warning signs could subtly foreshadow a potential obstacle or danger.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is urgent, there's no immediate, tangible threat presented in this paragraph.
* **Focus on Logistics:** The paragraph focuses heavily on logistical details (floor numbers, lift vs. stairs), which can slightly detract from the suspense.
