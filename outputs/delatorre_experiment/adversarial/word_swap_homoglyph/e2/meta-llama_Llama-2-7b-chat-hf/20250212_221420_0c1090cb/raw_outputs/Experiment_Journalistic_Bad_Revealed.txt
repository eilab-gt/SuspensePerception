4. The final sentence, "This is the story of what happened," creates a sense of anticipation and expectation, as the reader is left wondering what happened to Robert.

However, there are a few elements that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite long, which can make it feel a bit slow-paced and less suspenseful.
2. The language used is straightforward and factual, which doesn't create a lot of tension or suspense on its own.
3. The event described is a real one, which means that the reader may already know the outcome, which can reduce the suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could benefit from a bit more tension and anticipation to make it truly gripping.
