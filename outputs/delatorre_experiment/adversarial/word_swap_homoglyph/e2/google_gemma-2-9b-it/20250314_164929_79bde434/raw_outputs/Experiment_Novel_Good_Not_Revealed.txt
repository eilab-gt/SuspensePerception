I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by stating it's a true story with high stakes (a life-or-death situation).
* **Clear Conflict:** The conflict is established: Robert needs a liver transplant urgently, and his survival is uncertain.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of "8 a.m." and the "imminent" transplant creates a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is dire, the paragraph doesn't present an immediate, tangible threat. We don't know what could go wrong during the wait.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Hint at potential complications:**  Introduce a small detail that suggests something might go wrong (e.g., a sudden change in Robert's condition, a delay in the organ arrival).
* **Focus on the emotional tension:**  Describe Robert's fear or the medical team's anxiety more vividly.
* **End on a cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader with a question or a sense of unease about what might happen next.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Rising Action:** The paragraph builds on the previous one by introducing a concrete event – the arrival of the helicopter – which directly relates to Robert's fate.
* **Time Specificity:**  "08:57" adds a sense of urgency and precision, making the moment feel significant.
* **Juxtaposition:** The contrast between the helicopter's punctuality and Robert's critical condition creates a slight tension.

**However, it lacks some elements that could heighten the suspense:**

* **Internal Conflict:** We don't see Robert's or the medical team's reactions to the helicopter's arrival.  
* **External Threat:** There's no immediate danger presented. We don't know if the organ is viable or if there are any unforeseen complications.
* **Unresolved Question:** The paragraph ends without revealing what happens next, leaving the reader wanting more.

**To make it more suspenseful, consider:**

* **Adding sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the atmosphere in the hospital, or Robert's physical sensations.
* **Focusing on the medical team's emotions:** Show their anxiety, hope, or determination.
* **Introducing a potential obstacle:**  Mention a last-minute problem with the organ or a delay in the surgery.
