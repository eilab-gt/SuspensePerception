I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by claiming it's a true story and sets a serious tone.
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child in critical condition awaiting a life-saving transplant. This creates immediate tension.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of "since 8 a.m." and the uncertainty of Robert's survival while waiting for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Concrete Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a specific, immediate threat presented. We don't know what could go wrong or who might be in danger besides Robert.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* Hint at a potential complication or obstacle in the transplant process.
* Introduce a conflicting character or decision that adds complexity.
* Use more vivid language to describe Robert's condition and the emotional weight of the situation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Rising Action:** The paragraph builds on the previous one by introducing a concrete event – the arrival of the organ. This creates a sense of movement and anticipation.
* **Time Specificity:**  The precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and highlights the importance of this moment.
* **Juxtaposition:** The contrast between the helicopter's punctuality and Robert's critical but stable condition creates a slight tension. Will the organ arrive in time?

**However, it lacks some elements that could heighten the suspense:**

* **Internal Conflict:** We don't see Robert's or the medical team's emotional state as they await the organ. 
* **External Threat:** There's no immediate danger or obstacle presented. The paragraph focuses solely on the arrival of the organ.
* **Unanswered Questions:**  What happens next? Will the transplant be successful?  The paragraph ends abruptly, leaving the reader wanting more.


To make it more suspenseful, you could:

*  Describe Robert's physical or emotional state as the helicopter lands.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Concrete Detail:** The description of the men and the "small blue fridge" adds a sense of realism and specificity, grounding the reader in the situation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The seemingly mundane detail of a cleaner leaving a wet floor unattended creates a sense of potential danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Building Tension:**  The paragraph directly connects the previous scene (the arrival of the organ) with a potential point of conflict – the service stairwell.
* **Unforeseen Choice:** The decision to use the service stairwell, rather than a more direct route, adds an element of unpredictability.
* **Previous Hint:** The earlier mention of the wet floor in the stairwell (paragraph 4) now becomes a potential threat, raising the stakes.

**What could make it even more suspenseful:**

* **Internal Conflict:**  Show the men's thoughts or feelings about using the stairwell. Are they worried about the wet floor? Are they in a hurry?
* **External Threat:**  Introduce a subtle hint of danger – a creaking sound, a flickering light, or a sense of being watched.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:**  End the paragraph with a question or a statement that leaves the reader wondering what will happen next.



Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense by connecting previous events and introducing a potential point of conflict.
