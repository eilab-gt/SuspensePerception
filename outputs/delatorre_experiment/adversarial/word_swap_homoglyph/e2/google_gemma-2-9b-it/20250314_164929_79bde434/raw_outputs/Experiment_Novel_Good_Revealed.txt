I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a critical situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of Robert's critical condition and the wait for the liver transplant creates a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Tension:**  However, the paragraph lacks real tension-building elements. We know the outcome (the liver functions correctly), so there's no real sense of doubt or fear for Robert's survival. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the situation rather than showing us the emotional turmoil or the medical drama.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his fear, his hopes, his pain.
* **Highlight the risks:** Emphasize the potential complications of the transplant.
* **Create uncertainty:**  Leave the outcome ambiguous for longer, making the reader wonder if the transplant will be successful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Time Sensitivity:** The specific time (08:57) and the mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of urgency and anticipation.
* **Critical Condition:**  The phrase "critical but stable" adds a layer of tension, suggesting that Robert's condition is precarious.

* **Focus on the Medical Team:**  Highlight their stress, their expertise, and their determination to save Robert.
* **Hint at Potential Complications:**  Mention the risks associated with the transplant or foreshadow potential problems.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There's no immediate threat, danger, or mystery.
* **Passive Voice:** The frequent use of passive voice ("the floor was mopped," "the signs were not positioned") makes the action feel distant and uneventful.
* **Focus on the Ordinary:** The details about the cleaning supplies, the stairwell's lack of windows, and the friendly doctors all contribute to a sense of normalcy, rather than suspense.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Introduce an Anomaly:**  Something unexpected could happen during the cleaning routine, like finding a hidden object or encountering a strange person.
* **Hint at a Larger Story:**  The paragraph could be a setup for a more suspenseful narrative, with the seemingly ordinary cleaning job becoming connected to a larger mystery or danger.
* **Create a Sense of Unease:**  The author could use sensory details or foreshadowing to create a feeling of unease or dread, even in the midst of the mundane.
