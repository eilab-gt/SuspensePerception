I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by stating it's a true story with a high-stakes medical situation.
* **High Stakes:** The imminent liver transplant and Robert's critical condition create a sense of urgency and danger.
* **Foreshadowing:** The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" directly foreshadows potential complications or a negative outcome.

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a clear, immediate threat presented in this paragraph. We don't know what could go wrong or who might be in danger besides Robert.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* Introduce a specific obstacle or complication.
* Hint at a conflict or disagreement within the medical team.
* Create a sense of time pressure by mentioning a deadline or rapidly deteriorating condition.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The specific time (08:57) and mention of the helicopter landing create a sense of urgency and anticipation. 
* **High Stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition, so the arrival of the organ is crucial.

* **External Threat:**  Is there anything that could potentially go wrong with the transplant? A hint of a possible obstacle would increase the tension.


Overall, the paragraph sets the stage for a suspenseful moment, but it could be more impactful with a few additions.
