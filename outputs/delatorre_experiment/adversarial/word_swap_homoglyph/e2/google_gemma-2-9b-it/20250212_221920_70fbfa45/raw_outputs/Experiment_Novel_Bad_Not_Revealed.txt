I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by claiming it's a true story and sets a serious tone.
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire â€“ a child's life hangs in the balance, and time is running out.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends with "This is the story of what happened," leaving the reader wanting to know the outcome.

**What's Missing:**

* **Sensory Details:** The paragraph lacks vivid descriptions that could heighten the tension. We don't feel the urgency or the fear in the room.
* **Character Development:** We know very little about Robert or the medical team.  Connecting with them emotionally would increase the suspense.
* **Pacing:** The paragraph moves a bit too quickly. Slowing down and focusing on key moments could build suspense more effectively.


Overall, the paragraph has a good foundation for suspense, but it could be made even more gripping with some added details and a slower pace.
