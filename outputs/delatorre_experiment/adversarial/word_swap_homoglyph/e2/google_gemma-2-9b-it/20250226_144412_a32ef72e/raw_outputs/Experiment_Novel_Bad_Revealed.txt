I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Limited Tension:** While the arrival of the organ is significant, the paragraph lacks elements that build suspense. 
* **Neutral Tone:** The language is factual and straightforward, lacking any sense of urgency or foreboding.

Here's why:
