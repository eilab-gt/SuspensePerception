I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line immediately grabs attention by claiming it's a true story and sets a serious tone.
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child in critical condition awaiting a life-saving transplant. This creates immediate tension.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of "awaiting the arrival of the organ" and the uncertainty of Robert's survival introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Concrete Threat:** While the situation is tense, there isn't a specific, immediate threat presented. We don't know what could go wrong, which makes the suspense more general.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* Hint at a potential complication or obstacle.
* Introduce a conflicting character or decision.
* Use more vivid language to describe Robert's condition and the atmosphere.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Shift in Pace:**  The paragraph introduces a concrete event (the helicopter landing) which provides a sense of movement and forward momentum.
* **Limited Emotional Impact:** While the arrival of the organ is significant, the paragraph lacks emotional depth. We don't feel Robert's hope or the team's relief.
* **Lack of Conflict:** The landing is described as "punctual," suggesting everything is going according to plan. This removes a sense of uncertainty or potential danger.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Highlight the risks:** Mention the fragility of the organ or the potential for complications during transport.
* **Focus on internal conflict:** Describe the team's anxiety or Robert's fear as they wait for the surgery.
* **Introduce an unexpected element:** Perhaps the helicopter encounters bad weather or there's a last-minute issue with the organ.

Here's why:

* **Sense of Loss:** The phrase "without having been able to carry out the liver transplant" emphasizes the missed opportunity and the weight of the situation.
