I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the medical team and the patient waiting for a liver transplant. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense.
