This paragraph contributes to the overall suspense of the narrative by focusing on a pivotal moment—the arrival of the organ via helicopter. The specificity of the time creates a sense of urgency, and the mention of the organ's arrival suggests a turning point in the story. The reader is likely to feel relief that the organ has arrived on time, but the suspense is sustained by the uncertainty of Robert Bent's condition and whether the transplant will be successful. The word "critical" emphasizes the gravity of the situation, which keeps the tension high. However, the suspense is slightly mitigated by the word "stable," which may suggest to the reader that Robert has a fighting chance, thus the suspense is not at its peak but still quite palpable.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It vividly describes the intense and time-sensitive process of transporting the liver from the helicopter to the hospital.

The blue case is a focal point, symbolizing the precious cargo that is essential for Robert Bent's survival. The specific mention of the liver's temperature and functionality adds to the tension, as it implies that any deviation from these conditions could jeopardize the transplant.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful in isolation, as it primarily focuses on the routine activities of a hospital cleaner. The description of the cleaner's morning routine, his preference for cleaning the corridors over the service stairwell, and his interactions with hospital staff and patients provides context but does not build much tension. The mention of the lack of "wet floor" signs could hint at a potential accident waiting to happen, but without a direct connection to the urgent situation involving Robert Bent, the suspense is minimal. The paragraph is more about setting the scene and character rather than creating a sense of danger or impending doom. However, the detailed description of the cleaner's actions and the environment could be foreshadowing some future event that might be suspenseful, depending on how the story develops.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It details the path the men must take to deliver the liver to the patient, highlighting the decision-making process regarding the quickest route to the 6th floor.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution and relief rather than suspense. It confirms that Robert Bent's liver transplant was successful and that the organ was not adversely affected by the earlier mishap during transport. While the paragraph concludes a significant part of the narrative with a positive outcome, the suspense has largely been resolved by this point. The specific time stamp does add a touch of drama, as it marks the moment of confirmation, but the reader is no longer left wondering about the immediate fate of the patient. The suspense that was built up in previous paragraphs has been released, and this sentence serves more as a satisfying conclusion to the tension that was previously established. Therefore, on the suspense scale, it would rank lower, as the primary question of the liver's functionality has been answered.
