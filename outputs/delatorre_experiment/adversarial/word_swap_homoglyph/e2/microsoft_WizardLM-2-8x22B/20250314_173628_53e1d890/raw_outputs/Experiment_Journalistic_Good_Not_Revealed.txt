This paragraph adds to the suspense by describing a critical moment in the storyâ€”the arrival of the organ via helicopter. The specific time mentioned (08:57) and the detail of the organ's arrival create a sense of immediacy and importance. The reader is aware that the boy's condition is critical but stable, which suggests that the situation is precarious and that the transplant is a race against time. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the punctuality of the helicopter and the stable condition of the boy, which may imply that things are going according to plan. The suspense is present but not as heightened as it could be if there were complications or delays hinted at in the narrative.

This paragraph contributes to the suspense by focusing on the delivery of the liver, which is a pivotal moment in the transplant process. The description of the small blue fridge, shaped like a case, that stores the liver adds a tangible element to the scene, emphasizing the importance and fragility of the cargo. The presence of two men carrying this case suggests a careful and deliberate transfer, which can create tension as the reader anticipates any potential issues that could arise during this critical phase. However, the suspense is moderated by the fact that the liver is described as "fully functioning," which implies that, so far, the organ is in good condition. The paragraph sets the stage for what could happen next, maintaining a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph introduces a new element of potential danger that significantly heightens the suspense. The detail about the cleaner finishing mopping and not displaying a "wet floor" sign creates an impending sense of risk, as it suggests the possibility of an accident occurring in the service stairwell. Given the critical nature of the organ delivery, any obstacle or delay could have serious consequences for the young boy awaiting the transplant. The timing of this revelation, "minutes earlier," adds to the tension by implying that the characters involved in the organ transport might not be aware of the hazard. The reader is left in suspense, anticipating whether this oversight will lead to a complication or even a catastrophe in the story.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level. It directly connects the critical task of the two men transporting the liver with the previously established hazard of the unmarked wet floor in the service stairwell. The decision of the men to use the stairwell sets the scene for a potential accident that could jeopardize the liver transplant and, consequently, the life of young Robert Bent. The reader is aware of the danger that the characters are unknowingly walking into, which creates a sense of foreboding and tension. The focus on the characters' choice to enter the stairwell emphasizes the imminent risk and leaves the reader anticipating the outcome of this decision, making the suspense quite high.

This paragraph reaches a peak of suspense. The immediate consequence of the oversight with the "wet floor" sign is realized as one of the men slips on the stairs while carrying the case containing the liver. The description of the case "plunging down the stairs" vividly conveys the urgency and potential disaster unfolding. The reader is likely to be highly engaged at this point, as the critical nature of the organ's safety is paramount to the story's outcome. The suspense is at its maximum as the reader is left to wonder about the condition of the liver post-fall and the implications for the boy in need of the transplant. This moment is a climax of tension in the narrative.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense while also introducing a moment of quick action and decision-making. The immediate response of the colleague to go and warn the doctors suggests the gravity of the situation and the potential impact on the medical procedure. Meanwhile, the other man's efforts to regain his footing and his vigilance over the case, ensuring it remains untouched, add to the tension. The directive not to handle the case until the doctors arrive indicates that the contents are extremely delicate and crucial, presumably the liver meant for transplant. The reader is left in suspense, wondering about the state of the liver after the fall and the consequences for the boy awaiting surgery. The suspense is sustained by the uncertainty of the outcome and the anticipation of the doctors' assessment.

This paragraph provides a sense of relief and urgency simultaneously, which affects the level of suspense. The prompt arrival of the doctors suggests a rapid response to the situation, which could mitigate potential negative outcomes.

The reader is likely to feel a mix of reassurance that help has arrived quickly and anxiety about what the doctors will find when they assess the situation. The suspense is moderately high as the reader awaits the doctors' evaluation of the liver, which is critical to the boy's transplant surgery. The paragraph serves as a transition in the narrative, keeping the reader engaged and curious about the unfolding events.

The specific mention of a surgeon performing a biopsy adds a layer of seriousness and medical precision to the situation. The reader is kept in suspense, waiting for the results of the biopsy, which will determine the viability of the liver for transplant.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution to the immediate suspense regarding the condition of the liver. Learning that the organ has withstood the impact and is still viable for transplant relieves the tension built up by the previous events. However, the use of the word "possible" introduces a slight hesitation, suggesting that while the liver can be used, there may still be risks or uncertainties associated with the transplant procedure. The reader's suspense shifts from the immediate fate of the liver to the potential challenges that could arise during the surgery itself. The paragraph serves as a transition from one phase of suspense to another, with the focus now on the outcome of the transplant surgery.
