This paragraph is moderately suspenseful. It sets up a seemingly mundane scenario with the cleaner's routine task of mopping the hospital stairwell, which contrasts with the high-stakes situation involving Robert Bent's liver transplant. The detail about the cleaner not placing "wet floor" signs creates a sense of foreboding, as it suggests the potential for an accident that could interfere with the urgent delivery of the organ.

The reader is left to infer the potential consequences of the wet floors without direct reference to the urgency of the other events occurring in the hospital.
