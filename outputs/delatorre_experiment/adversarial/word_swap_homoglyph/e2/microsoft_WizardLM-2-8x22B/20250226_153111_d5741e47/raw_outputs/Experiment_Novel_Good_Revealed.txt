This paragraph contains elements that contribute to suspense, such as the precise timing and the critical condition of the patient. The mention of the helicopter landing on the roof of the hospital with the much-needed organ creates a sense of urgency and relief that the organ has arrived in time. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the use of the word "punctually," which suggests a degree of control and predictability in the situation. The reader is left with a sense of anticipation for what will happen next, but the immediate peril seems to have been temporarily resolved with the arrival of the organ. Therefore, while there is still suspense regarding the outcome of the transplant, the suspense level is moderate in this particular paragraph.

This paragraph is high in suspense. It vividly describes the intense scene of the helicopter landing, with the men carefully handling the precious blue case containing the liver. The details of the men's actions, the noise of the helicopter, and the communication between them create a palpable sense of urgency. The specific mention of the temperature of the liver and its importance adds to the tension, as it underscores the delicate nature of the organ's transport. The urgency is further emphasized by the reminder that the patient is in a critical situation and that there is no time to spare. The reader is likely to feel a strong sense of anticipation and concern for the outcome, not knowing if the liver will reach the operating room in time and in the right condition, making this paragraph very suspenseful.

This paragraph has a lower level of suspense, as it primarily focuses on the routine activities of a hospital cleaner. The description of the cleaner's morning routine, his preference for cleaning the corridors over the service stairwell, and his habit of whistling while he works all contribute to a sense of normalcy and mundanity. While there is a slight hint of potential danger with the mention of the cleaner not placing "wet floor" signs, this detail does not create a strong sense of imminent peril or tension related to the central plot of the boy's liver transplant. The paragraph serves more to establish setting and character rather than to build suspense, hence the lower rating on the suspense scale.

This paragraph provides a sense of resolution and relief, which naturally reduces the level of suspense compared to the preceding paragraphs. The confirmation that Robert Bent's transplanted liver is functioning correctly and was not affected by the earlier mishap is a positive development that the reader has been anticipating. However, the paragraph still carries a moderate level of suspense because it concludes a critical phase of the medical procedure without necessarily guaranteeing a completely successful outcome. The reader may still have lingering concerns about potential complications, the patient's recovery, and long-term prognosis. The specificity of the time (21:26) adds a sense of finality to the event, which can create a moment of suspense as the reader reflects on the preceding events and their culmination in this moment. Overall, while the paragraph signals a positive turn, it maintains some suspense by not fully closing the door on future uncertainties.
