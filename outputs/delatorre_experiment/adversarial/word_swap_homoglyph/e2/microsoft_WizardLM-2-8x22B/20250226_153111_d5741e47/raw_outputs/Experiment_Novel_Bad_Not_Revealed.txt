The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the boy's critical condition and the urgency of the situation (his survival being uncertain) creates a sense of tension and concern for the outcome. The specific details, such as the date and the boy's name, add a touch of realism that can make the suspense feel more immediate and personal to the reader.

This paragraph adds to the suspense by introducing a time-sensitive event that is critical to the boy's survival—the arrival of the donor organ via helicopter. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of urgency and precision that is often associated with high-stakes situations. The detail that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that there is a delicate balance between life and death, which can heighten the reader's concern for the boy's fate. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually," which implies a successful step in the process, potentially reducing immediate concern for a delay-related complication. Overall, the paragraph maintains interest and concern for the character's well-being, but it also provides some reassurance, which is why it might be rated slightly lower on the suspense scale compared to a scenario that leaves the outcome more uncertain.

This paragraph is high in suspense. It vividly describes the intense and time-sensitive scenario of the organ delivery, with the rotors still turning and the men quickly moving from the helicopter with the precious blue case. The detail that the liver must be kept at a specific temperature (four degrees centigrade) adds to the stakes, as any deviation could jeopardize the transplant. The inaudible shouting and the gesture of pointing to the watch convey the urgency of the situation, emphasizing that every second counts. The nod and the immediate action towards the exit maintain the tension, as the reader is aware that the patient's life hangs in the balance. The final sentence confirms the critical nature of the situation, reinforcing the need for haste and the potential for a race against time. All these elements combine to create a suspenseful scene that keeps the reader fully engaged and anxious about the outcome.

This paragraph is relatively low in suspense. It provides a detailed account of the cleaner's routine work in the hospital, focusing on the mundane aspects of his job, such as mopping the floors of the service stairwell and his interactions with staff and patients. The description of the cleaner's actions and thoughts suggests a normal, uneventful day at work. The mention of the "wet floor" signs not being used could hint at a potential hazard, but there is no immediate tension or impending danger presented that would significantly raise the suspense level. The narrative is more about setting the scene and introducing a character and his habits rather than building suspense. It does not leave the reader with a sense of imminent threat or a pressing question about an urgent situation, which are typical elements of a suspenseful narrative.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It describes the specific path the men must take to deliver the organ to the patient, including the decision to use the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator. The detail of the layout of the hospital and the reasoning behind choosing the stairs over the lift adds a sense of urgency and strategy to the situation, which can create tension for the reader. The fact that the patient is on the 6th floor and the men are considering the quickest route suggests that time is of the essence, and any delay could have serious consequences. However, the conversation between the two men and the subsequent action is more procedural than dramatic, which keeps the suspense level from reaching a peak. The reader is aware that the men are making calculated decisions to expedite the process, which provides some reassurance that the situation is under control, thus mitigating the suspense to a certain extent.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. The detailed description of the medical procedures—transferring the organ to the laboratory, examining its superficial condition, and preparing for a biopsy—creates a tense atmosphere where every action is critical. The mention of the liver's enzyme activity being "sufficiently low" offers a glimmer of hope, but the emphasis on the importance of the metabolic rate and the need for a precise biopsy underscores the delicacy and risk involved. The surgeon's nervousness, despite his experience with numerous biopsies, adds to the tension, highlighting the gravity of the situation and the potential for a life-altering mistake. The image of everyone else in the laboratory stepping back to give him space emphasizes the solitude and pressure he faces as he performs the procedure with the child's life in the balance. The precision required—being just "one millimetre out" could cause "irreparable damage"—keeps the reader on edge, fully invested in the outcome of this critical moment. The suspense is palpable as the reader awaits the result of the biopsy, which will determine the fate of the young patient.
