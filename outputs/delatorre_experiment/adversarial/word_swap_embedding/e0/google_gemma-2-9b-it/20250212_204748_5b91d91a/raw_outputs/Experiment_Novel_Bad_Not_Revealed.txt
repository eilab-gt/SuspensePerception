I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

I'd rate this paragraph a **7/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Visual Details:** The image of the men battling the wind and the helicopter's noise creates a sense of urgency and danger.
* **Limited Communication:** The inaudible shout and the reliance on gestures add to the tension and create a sense of mystery.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful nature of the cleaner's job. There are no hints of danger, mystery, or conflict.
