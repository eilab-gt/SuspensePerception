I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a real event and a life-or-death situation immediately grabs attention.
* **High Stakes:** The imminent liver transplant and Robert's critical condition create a sense of urgency and danger.
* **Lack of Tension Building:**  The paragraph tells us what happened rather than showing us the suspense. We're given information about the timeline and the medical procedures, but we don't feel the emotional weight of the situation.
* **Flat Language:** The writing style is rather matter-of-fact and lacks vivid descriptions or sensory details that could heighten the suspense.

**To improve the suspensefulness, consider:**

* **Focusing on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his fear, his hope, his pain.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the situation was critical, describe the symptoms, the frantic activity of the medical team, the ticking clock.
* **Use sensory details:**  Describe the sterile smell of the hospital, the beeping of machines, the hushed whispers.
* **Create cliffhangers:**  End the paragraph on a note of uncertainty or danger, leaving the reader wanting more.
