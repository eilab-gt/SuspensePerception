I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The heavily unconventional grammar and spelling make it difficult to follow the story and create a sense of urgency or intrigue. 
* **Lack of Clear Conflict:** While we understand there's a medical situation, the specific conflict or danger isn't clearly defined. We know Robert is in a critical situation, but we don't know what the immediate threat is.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or actions that create suspense.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Use correct grammar and spelling:** This would make the story more engaging and easier to follow.
* **Focus on a specific, immediate threat:**  What is the danger Robert faces right now? Is it a complication from the surgery, a rejection of the kidney, or something else?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying Robert's situation is critical, describe his physical state, the worried expressions of the doctors, or the ticking clock of the operating room.
