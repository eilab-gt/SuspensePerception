* **Clear and Engaging Language:**  Correct the grammatical errors and use more descriptive language to paint a picture of the situation.
* **Focused Narrative:**  Streamline the events and focus on the key moments leading up to Robert's death.
* **Show, Don't Tell:**  Instead of stating facts, use sensory details and dialogue to convey the emotions and tension.
