I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Jumbled and Unclear:** The paragraph is poorly written with grammatical errors and unclear sentence structure. This makes it difficult to follow the story and creates confusion rather than suspense.
* **Lack of Tension:**  While the situation involves a critical kidney transplant, the paragraph doesn't build any real tension or anticipation. We're told Roberto's situation is critical, but there's no sense of urgency or danger.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the events rather than showing us. We're told Roberto's transplant was successful, but we don't experience the emotional rollercoaster of the surgery or the relief of its outcome.


To make this paragraph more suspenseful, the writer could:

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds, the smells, the emotions of the people involved.
* **Create a Pacing:**  Use shorter sentences and build towards a climax. 
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Roberto's condition, describe his physical state, his breathing, his reactions.
* **Introduce Conflict:**  Add an unexpected obstacle or complication to the transplant process.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("de," "agencies," "nova") distract the reader and make it hard to fully engage with the scene.
* **Vague Details:** We don't know who the "agencies" are or what their purpose is. This lack of clarity hinders our ability to understand the situation and feel suspense.
* **Telling, Not Showing:**  The paragraph tells us Robert is in a "critical although steady condition" but doesn't show us any signs of this through his actions or descriptions.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Clarify the Situation:** Who are the agencies? What are they doing? Why is Robert's condition important?
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his appearance, breathing, or any other physical cues that convey his fragility.
* **Build Tension:**  Use stronger verbs and sensory details to create a sense of urgency. For example, instead of "landed rapidly," describe the helicopter's blades whipping the air, creating a sense of chaos.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The image of two men descending from a helicopter in a whirlwind of blades is visually striking and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Mysterious Details:** The mention of a "bruise lawsuit" and "incomprehensible weeping" hints at a backstory and raises questions about the situation.

* **Lack of Clarity:**  We don't know who these men are, what their mission is, or the nature of the "indisposed situation." This lack of context hinders our ability to feel truly invested in the suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the wind whipping around the men, the smell of the hospital.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying the man is "in a heat to quatre degrees ratio," describe his physical state – sweating, flushed, agitated.
* **Build Tension:**  Use shorter sentences and create a sense of urgency. For example, instead of "they had become tells that to indisposed was for a indispensable situation," try something like "They knew time was running out. Every second counted."

By clarifying the situation, focusing on sensory details, and building tension, this paragraph could become much more suspenseful.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Tension:** The paragraph delivers a straightforward, uneventful update on the patient's condition. There's no sense of urgency or danger.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The information is simply stated rather than conveyed through vivid descriptions or character reactions. We're told the transplant was successful, but we don't feel the relief or joy of the moment.
