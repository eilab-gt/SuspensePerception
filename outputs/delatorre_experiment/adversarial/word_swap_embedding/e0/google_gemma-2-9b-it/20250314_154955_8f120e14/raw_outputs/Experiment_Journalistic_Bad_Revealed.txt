I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous spelling and grammatical errors distract from the potential suspense.  It's hard to get invested in a story when the writing is difficult to understand.
* **Lack of Pacing:** The paragraph tells us a lot of information upfront (the date, the boy's name, the medical situation) without building tension or creating a sense of urgency.
* **Missing Emotional Connection:** We're told Robert is in critical condition and the doctors are unsure if he'll survive, but we don't feel his fear or the desperation of the situation.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds, the smells, the atmosphere.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert is critical, describe his labored breathing, his pale skin, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Create a Cliffhanger:** End the paragraph on a note that leaves the reader wanting more. For example, you could say something like, "Just as the surgeon reached for the scalpel, the phone rang..."
