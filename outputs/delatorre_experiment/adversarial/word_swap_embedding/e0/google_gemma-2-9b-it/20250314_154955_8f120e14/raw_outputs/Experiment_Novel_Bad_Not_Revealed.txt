I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors make the paragraph difficult to read and understand. This disrupts the flow and prevents the reader from getting fully immersed in the story.
* **Lack of Detail:**  While the paragraph sets up a scenario with a potential life-or-death situation, it lacks specific details that would create suspense. We don't know anything about Marcelo's condition, the severity of his illness, or the challenges the medical team faces.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us that the situation is "pivotal" and that the team is "not persuaded" Armando will survive, but it doesn't show us these things through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Correct the grammatical errors:** This will make the writing clearer and more engaging.
* **Provide more specific details:** Describe Marcelo's illness, the urgency of the situation, and the emotions of the medical team.
* **Use sensory details:**  Appeal to the reader's senses by describing the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital environment.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** Use strong verbs and short sentences to convey the feeling of time running out.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:**  Like the previous paragraph, the grammatical errors make it hard to follow and detract from the potential suspense.
* **Vague Details:** We know a helicopter landed, and Patricia Bent is in a "pivotal but stable" condition, but we don't know *why* the helicopter is there or what "pivotal" means in this context. This lack of clarity prevents the reader from fully engaging with the situation.
* **Missing Emotional Hook:**  The paragraph lacks any emotional connection. We don't feel Patricia's fear, the urgency of the situation, or the tension surrounding her condition.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Correct the grammar:**  This will make the writing clearer and more impactful.
* **Provide context:**  Who is Patricia Bent? What is her condition? Why is the helicopter so important?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying she's in a "pivotal" situation, describe the scene in a way that conveys the gravity of her condition.
* **Add sensory details:**  Describe the sound of the helicopter, the expressions on the faces of the medical staff, the atmosphere in the hospital.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph starts with a sense of urgency ("discs were nonetheless turning," "men descended of per helicopter") and introduces a potentially dangerous situation ("cyclone for aux yarns blades," "thermal del four degrees centigrade").
* **Action and Movement:** The paragraph is filled with action verbs and descriptions of movement, which keeps the reader engaged.
* **Mysterious Elements:**  We don't know who these men are, what they're carrying, or why they're in such a hurry. This lack of information creates a sense of mystery and intrigue.

**However, the paragraph also has some weaknesses:**

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The numerous grammatical errors make the paragraph difficult to read and understand. This disrupts the flow and prevents the reader from fully immersing themselves in the story.
* **Lack of Clarity:**  While the paragraph hints at danger, it doesn't clearly establish the stakes or the threat. What is so important about the "unwell" person? What are the consequences if they don't get help?
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us that the situation is "pivotal" but doesn't show us why.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Correct the grammar:** This will make the writing clearer and more impactful.
* **Provide more context:** Who are these men? What is their relationship to the "unwell" person? What is the nature of the threat?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying the situation is "pivotal," describe the scene in a way that conveys the urgency and danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the mundane details of a janitor's daily routine. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or conflict.
* **Lack of Tension:** The writing is very descriptive but lacks any elements that would create tension or suspense.  
* **Predictable Plot:**  We know exactly what's going to happen: the janitor will finish mopping, collect his trolley, and go about his day. There are no surprises or unexpected twists.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a Conflict:**  Something unexpected needs to happen to disrupt the routine. Perhaps the janitor finds something unusual while cleaning, or he hears a strange noise.
* **Create a Sense of Unease:** Use sensory details to create a feeling of unease or foreboding. Describe the hospital in a way that feels cold, sterile, or unsettling.
* **Hint at a Larger Story:**  Subtly suggest that there's something more going on beneath the surface. Perhaps the janitor overhears a conversation that raises questions, or he notices something out of place.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.
