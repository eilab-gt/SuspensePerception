 I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph does create a sense of anticipation with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, and the use of the word "tumbled" implies that there might be some complications or unexpected events. However, the paragraph is relatively short and lacks additional details that could further build tension and suspense. Additionally, the information that the patient is in a "critical but stable condition" reduces the level of suspense as it implies that the patient is not in immediate danger. The paragraph could have been more suspenseful if it provided more information about the risks and challenges associated with the transplant, or if it hinted at potential obstacles that the medical team might face in their efforts to save the patient.

 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph does provide some new information that could potentially build tension, such as the arrival of two men and the presence of a "small bruise fridge" containing the liver. However, the paragraph is still relatively short and lacks additional details that could further develop the story and create a greater sense of suspense. Additionally, the use of the word "fridge" to describe the container for the liver is not particularly evocative or suspenseful. The paragraph could have been more suspenseful if it provided more information about the source of the liver, the qualifications of the men who brought it, or the risks and challenges associated with the transplant. 

It's worth noting that suspense is often created through the use of details that create a sense of uncertainty, danger, or risk. While this paragraph does provide some new information, it could benefit from additional details that heighten the stakes and create a greater sense of anticipation and tension.
