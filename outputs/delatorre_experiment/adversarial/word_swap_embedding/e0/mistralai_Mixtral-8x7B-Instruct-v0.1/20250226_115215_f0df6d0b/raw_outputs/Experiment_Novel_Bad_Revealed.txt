 I would rate the paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph provides some tension through the use of the word "critical" to describe the young boy's condition, and the mention of the helicopter's punctual arrival adds a sense of urgency.

Additionally, the fact that the boy is in a "stable" condition reduces the sense of immediate danger or risk.
