* The writing style is also quite awkward and hard to follow, which detracts from any potential suspense. The use of non-standard English and grammatical errors makes it difficult to focus on the story.

Overall, while the paragraph tries to create some tension, it falls flat due to the clumsy writing and lack of a compelling or unexpected twist.
