 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The setting in a hospital, the critical condition of the young boy, the imminent liver transplant, and the uncertainty about the donor and the boy's survival all contribute to a sense of tension and anticipation. The use of the phrase "What you are about to read" also adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the challenges faced during the transplant or the consequences of failure.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. The landing of the helicopter carrying the organ is an important event in the story, but it does not create a significant sense of tension or anticipation on its own. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ's journey, the urgency of the situation, or the potential consequences if the organ did not arrive in time.  However, the paragraph does contribute to building the overall suspense of the story by setting the scene for the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. The arrival of the men and the liver adds to the sense of urgency and anticipation, as the reader knows that the organ has arrived and the transplant can now proceed. The use of the phrase "fully functioning liver" also emphasizes the importance of the organ and the stakes involved in the transplant. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the men's expressions, the urgency of their movements, or the reactions of the medical team upon seeing the liver.  However, the paragraph does contribute to building the overall suspense of the story by providing a visual image of the organ and the men who are responsible for delivering it.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the suspensefulness scale. The mention of the cleaner mopping the floor does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story, as it does not directly relate to the transplant or the critical condition of Robert Bent. In fact, it seems to be an unrelated detail that slows down the pace of the story and distracts from the main action. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to focus more on the preparations for the transplant or the medical team's readiness.  However, the paragraph does not detract from the overall suspense of the story, as it is a brief and unimportant detail.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 on the suspensefulness scale. The men's decision to walk down the service stairwell instead of taking the elevator does not create a significant sense of tension or anticipation. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the reasons for their decision, the layout of the hospital, or the potential risks involved in taking the service stairwell. However, the paragraph does contribute to building the overall suspense of the story by showing the men's determination to get the liver to Robert Bent as quickly as possible.
