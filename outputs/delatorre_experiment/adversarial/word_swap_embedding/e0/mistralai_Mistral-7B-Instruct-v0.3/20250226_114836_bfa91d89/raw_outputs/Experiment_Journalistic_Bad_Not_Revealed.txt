 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant for Robert Bent, and the uncertainty about his survival while waiting for the organ. The use of phrases like "critical situation" and "they were not sure if Robert would survive" contribute to the suspenseful tone. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the challenges or obstacles that might arise during the transplant or the wait for the organ.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, but it does not provide much information about the challenges or obstacles that might arise during the transplant or the impact of the organ's arrival on Robert's condition. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the helicopter's journey, the tension in the hospital as they awaited its arrival, or the potential consequences if the organ did not arrive in time.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the arrival of the men carrying the liver, and the use of the phrase "fully functioning liver" adds to the tension. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the men's expressions or the reactions of the medical team as they saw the liver being unloaded from the helicopter. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could also describe the importance of the liver and the potential consequences if it was damaged during transport.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story, as it seems unrelated to the main plot about Robert Bent's liver transplant. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to show how the cleaner's actions might have impacted the transplant, such as by making the floor slippery and causing someone to slip and drop the liver.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph does not contribute much to the overall suspense of the story, as it simply describes the men's actions without providing any new information about the transplant or Robert's condition.

   I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency with the man slipping on the wet floor and the case falling down the stairs. The use of the phrase "the case plunged down the stairs" adds to the suspense, as it suggests that something valuable and important has been put at risk. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could describe the impact of the case on the stairs or the reactions of the medical team as they heard the commotion.  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​

   I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency with the discovery that the interior bag had ruptured, as it suggests that the liver may have been damaged during the fall. The use of the phrase "when they opened the case" adds to the suspense, as it suggests that the doctors were unsure of what they would find. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could describe the doctors' reactions or the potential consequences if the liver was damaged beyond repair.  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​

    I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and disappointment with the discovery that the liver was damaged beyond repair, as it suggests that Robert's transplant has been jeopardized. The use of the phrase "it was impossible to use the organ for transplant" adds to the suspense, as it leaves the reader wondering what will happen to Robert. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could describe the doctors' reactions or the potential consequences if a replacement organ is not found in time.  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​

    I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tragedy and finality with the death of Robert, as it shows that the transplant was not successful due to the damaged liver. The use of the phrase "21:26" adds to the suspense, as it leaves the reader wondering what happened in the final moments before Robert's death. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could describe the doctors' reactions or the impact of Robert's death on his family.  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​
