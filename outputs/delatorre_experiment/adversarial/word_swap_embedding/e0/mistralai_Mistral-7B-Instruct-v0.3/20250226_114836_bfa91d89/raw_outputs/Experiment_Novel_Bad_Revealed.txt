 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The narrative sets up a tense situation with the impending liver transplant and the critical condition of the young boy, Robert Bent. The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait and the unexpected turn of events with the death of the donor add to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the events leading up to the transplant and the emotional impact on the characters involved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph does not provide any new information about the critical situation of Robert Bent or the impending liver transplant, and the landing of the helicopter is a common occurrence in hospitals. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the helicopter's mission, the urgency of the situation, or the emotions of the characters involved. 2  At 08:57, the helicopter carrying the life-saving liver for Robert Bent's transplant landed on the roof of the hospital, but the medical team was not prepared for the unexpected complication that would arise. The organ was damaged in transit, and the team had to scramble to find a backup donor before it was too late. The clock was ticking, and the fate of young Robert Bent hung in the balance. 3.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the critical situation of the patient and the need for the medical team to act quickly. The description of the men descending from the helicopter and the focus on the blue case containing the liver adds to the tension. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the blades and the wind blowing the men's hair, helps to immerse the reader in the scene. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the patient's condition or the consequences of failing to perform the transplant in time. 3. Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver that could save the life of a young boy. The other shouted something inaudible, but his colleague couldn't hear him over the noise of the blades. He touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at his watch, and then at the doorway off the roof. The man transporting the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. They had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. 4.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph describes a routine cleaning task and does not create a sense of tension or urgency. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to connect the cleaning task to the critical situation of the patient or the impending liver transplant. For example:

4. Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, unaware that it would soon become the scene of a life-or-death struggle. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital's eight floors. It wasn't a particularly interesting job, but he took pride in keeping the hospital clean and sanitary. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of color on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there were always a bored patient happy to have a chat. Generally, it was an agreeable labor. Yet, the service stairwell wasn't dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases dispersed in the building's wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket, and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn't disturb the "wet floor" warning signs at the top of each section. Little did he know that in just a few short minutes, the service stairwell would become the stage for a desperate race against time to save a young boy's life.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 4 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides some information about the layout of the hospital and the location of the service stairwell, but it does not create a sense of urgency or tension. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to connect the information about the hospital layout to the critical situation of the patient or the impending liver transplant. For example:

5. The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the landing of the service stairwell was another door leading onto one of the hospital's secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom, and the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case hesitated for a moment, then turned to his colleague. "The patient is on the 6th floor," he said, realizing that taking the lift would waste precious time. "By the time we get there and wait for the elevator, it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors." His colleague nodded and followed him down the service stairwell, their hearts pounding with the weight of the responsibility on their shoulders. Every step they took brought them closer to the young boy who was waiting for the life-saving liver that was now in their hands.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the man's slip on the stairs and the potential for the case to be damaged or lost. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the case rolling down the stairs, helps to immerse the reader in the scene. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of losing the liver or the emotions of the men as they watch the case roll down the stairs. For example:

6. His footing slipped as he placed it on the first step, and he felt his ankle twist painfully. Since his other foot was already raised, he couldn't stay upright. Without thinking, he reached out to grab hold of the railing with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs, making a noise that sounded like a bag of loose keys being shaken, while he managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror as the case spun over everything step, their hearts pounding with the weight of the responsibility on their shoulders. They knew that every second counted, and they couldn't afford to lose the precious liver that could save a young boy's life. 7.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides some information about the men's actions after the case rolls down the stairs, but it does not create a sense of urgency or tension. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to focus more on the potential damage to the liver and the consequences of losing it. For example:

7. Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other with worry in their eyes. The man who had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again, but his colleague stopped him. "Be careful," he warned, "We don't know if it's been damaged. It's best to call the doctors." The other nodded, pulling back his hand. "I'll go," continued the first. "You stay here and watch it, in case something happens." Without wasting a moment, he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He moved quickly through the labyrinthine network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. Every second counted, and he knew that the fate of a young boy hung in the balance. 8. Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the injured man's superstition that the condition of the liver depends on his suffering, and the arrival of the doctors adds to the urgency of the situation. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the doctors rushing up the stairs, helps to immerse the reader in the scene. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the condition of the liver or the emotions of the characters as they wait for the doctors to examine it. For example:

8. Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold of the railing, his colleague hadn't moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibilities that the contents of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, and he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, while the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overworked by the superstition that the condition of that liver in nearly came down to the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors had soon arrived. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell, their footsteps echoing in the narrow corridor. Directly, three doctors seemed, followed by his colleague. “Move aside, please,” asked one of the physicians, who was kneeling down next to the case. The man hesitated for a moment, then stepped aside, his heart pounding with the weight of the responsibility on his shoulders. He knew that every second counted, and he couldn't afford to lose the precious liver that could save a young boy's life. The doctors worked quickly, their hands moving with practiced efficiency as they examined the case and the liver inside. The man could only watch, his eyes fixed on the liver as the doctors worked, his mind racing with thoughts of what would happen if they found that it was damaged. 9.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the mention of the damaged case and the potential for the liver to be ruined. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the click and the sight of the refrigerated air escaping, helps to immerse the reader in the scene. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of losing the liver or the emotions of the characters as they react to the damage. For example:

9. He heard a click as the doctor pressed the end of the handle with his thumbs, and the outer case opened to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look, the doctor turned to those watching, shaking her head. He closed the case, his heart sinking as he saw the long split down one side of the fridge, through which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The doctors exchanged worried glances, their faces pale with the realization that the liver had been damaged in the fall. The man who had been carrying the case felt a wave of despair wash over him, his mind racing with thoughts of what would happen if they couldn't find a replacement liver in time. Every second counted, and he knew that the fate of a young boy hung in the balance. 10.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the mention of the delicate procedure and the potential for the liver to be damaged. The use of sensory details, such as the description of the surgeon's gloved hands and the mention of the child's life hanging in the balance, helps to immerse the reader in the scene. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of damaging the liver or the emotions of the characters as they work. For example:

10. According to the original diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct, but the medical team knew that everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this, it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent metastasis. With a confronting mask covering his face, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies before, but never before had a child's life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out, he would damage the organ irreparably. The surgeon's heart pounded in his chest as he took a deep breath, his hands trembling slightly as he prepared to make the incision. Every second counted, and he knew that the fate of a young boy hung in the balance. He couldn't afford to make a mistake. 11.

The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the mention of the delicate procedure and the potential for the liver to be damaged. The use of sensory details, such as the description of the surgeon's anxious expressions and the mention of the interminable half a minute, helps to immerse the reader in the scene. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the damaged liver or the emotions of the characters as they react to the diagnosis. For example:

11. Holding his breath, he inserted the needles one centimeter. Relieved for not encountering any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube, his heart pounding in his chest as he analysed the sample. As he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times, the seconds seemed to stretch on forever. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and sounded with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively worsened as a result of the impact. The surgeon's heart sank as he realized that they had lost precious time, and the young boy's chances of survival were now slim. He couldn't believe that something as simple as a slip on the stairs could have such devastating consequences. 12. Holding his breath, he inserted the needles one centimeter.

   I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides information about the outcome of the situation, but it does not create a sense of tension or urgency. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of losing the liver or the emotions of the characters as they react to the news of Robert Bent's death. For example:

12. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without being able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damages that the organ sustained in transit. The surgeon's heart sank as he realized that all their efforts had been in vain. The young boy's family, who had been waiting anxiously in the waiting room, burst into tears as they were informed of the news. The doctors exchanged somber glances, their faces pale with the realization that they had failed to save a life. The surgeon couldn't believe that something as simple as a slip on the stairs could have such devastating consequences. He knew that he would never forget the look of hope in the boy's eyes as he had been wheeled into the operating room, and the despair in his own eyes as he had been forced to tell the family that the liver was damaged beyond repair. He couldn't help but wonder if there was something more he could have done, some way he could have prevented this tragedy. 13.
