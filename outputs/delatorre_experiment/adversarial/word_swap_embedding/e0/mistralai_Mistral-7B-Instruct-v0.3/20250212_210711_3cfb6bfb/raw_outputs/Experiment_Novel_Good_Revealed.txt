 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The narrative sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant, the critical condition of the young boy, and the uncertainty about the donor organ's condition in transit. The suspense is further heightened by the specific time details, such as the exact hour the transplant was performed and the confirmation of the liver's functionality. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it included more details about the challenges faced during the transplant or the emotional reactions of the medical team and the boy's family.

However, the paragraph is still effective in building tension and anticipation for the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell, but it does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story. In fact, the paragraph serves as a contrast to the urgent and critical situation unfolding in the hospital, and it may even distract the reader from the main narrative. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it included details about the cleaner's role in the hospital or if it was revealed that the cleaner played a significant part in the transplant story. However, as it stands, the paragraph does not contribute to the suspense of the story.
