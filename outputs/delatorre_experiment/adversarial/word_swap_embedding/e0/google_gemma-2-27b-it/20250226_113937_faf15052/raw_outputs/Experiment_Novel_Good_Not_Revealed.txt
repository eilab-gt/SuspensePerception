I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The opening line about a real event and a child needing a liver transplant immediately grabs attention.
* **High stakes:** The mention of a critical situation and the uncertainty of survival creates tension.
* **Weak execution:** The paragraph suffers from several issues:
    * **Grammatical errors:**  "vous," "himself," "Jen," "her" are all incorrect and jarring.
    * **Awkward phrasing:** Sentences like "an eight year old boy called Cynthia Bent" and "they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ" are clunky.
    * **Lack of immediacy:** The paragraph feels distant and lacks a sense of urgency.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Correct the grammatical errors.**
* **Use stronger verbs and more vivid language.**
* **Focus on the boy's perspective and his emotional state.**
* **Create a sense of ticking clock by emphasizing the limited time.**
