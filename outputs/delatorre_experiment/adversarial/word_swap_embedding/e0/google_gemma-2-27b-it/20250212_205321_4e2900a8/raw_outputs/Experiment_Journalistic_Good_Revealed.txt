I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and needs the transplant to survive. This creates some tension.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The wait for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential problems:** The mention of the liver being damaged in transit raises the possibility of complications.

However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right at the end of the paragraph. This removes much of the suspense.
* **The language is factual and lacks emotional weight:** The writing style is more informative than gripping.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader wondering about Robert's fate until later in the story.
* **Focus on Robert's emotional state:** Describe his fear, hope, or pain to create empathy and heighten the stakes.
* **Use more evocative language:** Employ sensory details and figurative language to draw the reader into the scene.

Here's why:

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **It provides a satisfying resolution:** We learn that the transplant was successful, fulfilling the promise set up earlier in the story.
* **It echoes the opening paragraph:** The repetition of the time (21:26) creates a sense of closure and emphasizes the long wait.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:
