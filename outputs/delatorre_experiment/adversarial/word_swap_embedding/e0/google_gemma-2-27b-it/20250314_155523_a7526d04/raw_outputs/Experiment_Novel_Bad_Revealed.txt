Here's why:

* **Action and Urgency:** The description of the helicopter landing, the men rushing with the case, and the emphasis on time create a sense of urgency and action.
* **Mysterious Elements:** The "unfathomable" shout and the mention of a "desperate situation" add intrigue and leave the reader wanting to know more.

This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The description of a janitor cleaning a stairwell is inherently not very suspenseful.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There's no sense of danger, threat, or mystery. The janitor's workday seems ordinary and uneventful.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("The service stairwell did not have windows," "The fire extinguisher was constantly positioned") makes the writing feel flat and lifeless.

**To improve suspensefulness:**

* **Introduce a threat:** What if the janitor discovers something unsettling in the stairwell? What if he hears a strange noise or sees something out of place?
* **Create a sense of isolation:** Emphasize the emptiness and silence of the stairwell. Make the reader feel alone and vulnerable.
* **Use foreshadowing:** Hint at something bad that might happen later in the story.
