Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The paragraph deals with a life-or-death situation involving a child's liver transplant. The success of the procedure hinges on the delicate work being done.
* **Technical Detail:** The use of medical jargon like "hepatology experimental," "biochemical speed," and "colonoscopy" adds a sense of realism and urgency.
* **Character Tension:** The surgeon's nervousness and the description of his "twitchy" hand convey the pressure he's under.

**However:**

* **Dense Language:** The paragraph is quite dense and technical, which can make it difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with medical terminology.

* **Internal Monologue:** Give the reader access to the surgeon's thoughts and feelings. What is he hoping for? What are his fears?
* **Show the Impact:**  Don't just tell us the organ has deteriorated. Show the surgeon's reaction, the colleague's despair, and the implications for the child's future.

By amplifying the emotional impact and drawing out the suspense, you can make this paragraph even more gripping.
