This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Confusing Language:** The writing is riddled with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, making it difficult to follow the story and build tension. 
* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While there's a hint of uncertainty about Robert Bent's survival, it's not presented in a way that creates a strong sense of danger or anticipation.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was uncovered," "were all ready") distances the reader from the action and reduces the impact.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Clear and Concise Writing:**  Correct the grammatical errors and use clear, direct language.
* **Establish a Clear Threat:** Make the stakes higher by explicitly stating the potential consequences if the transplant fails.
* **Active Voice:** Use active voice to make the writing more dynamic and engaging.

This paragraph scores a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Situation:** The image of a helicopter carrying a body landing on a hospital roof is inherently dramatic and raises questions.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The precise time ("08:57") and the word "punctually" add a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Vague Details:** The lack of context about who the body is and why it's being transported leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Build Atmosphere:** Add sensory details to create a more immersive experience. Describe the sound of the helicopter, the reactions of people on the ground, the tension in the air.
* **Hint at the Stakes:**  Give clues about the potential consequences of the situation. Is the body a patient in need of urgent care? Is there a threat involved?
* **Delay Gratification:** Don't reveal all the information at once. Keep the reader guessing by withholding key details until later in the story.

This paragraph scores a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Detail:** The image of a "minor blue fridge" carrying a liver is both unusual and unsettling. It immediately piques the reader's curiosity.
* **High Stakes:** The implication that the liver is needed for a transplant adds a layer of urgency and raises the stakes.
* **Mystery:** The paragraph leaves many questions unanswered. Who are the men? Who is the liver for? What will happen next?

**To improve suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating that the liver is "fully operating," describe its appearance or the precautions being taken to keep it viable.
* **Build Tension:** Use sensory details to create a sense of anticipation. Describe the men's movements, their expressions, the sounds of the helicopter.
* **Foreshadowing:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles that could arise. Is the liver compatible? Will they reach the patient in time?




####################################################################################################
This paragraph scores a **3** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Potential for Danger:** The mention of a wet floor without a warning sign creates a sense of potential danger. The reader anticipates someone might slip and fall.
* **Lack of Context:** We don't know who might be in danger or what the consequences of a fall might be. This lack of context limits the suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("ha finishing," "leave without showing") makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Introduce a Character:**  Focus on a specific person who is about to walk down the stairs. Describe their thoughts, feelings, and obliviousness to the danger.
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  Suggest that a fall could have serious consequences for this character. Are they carrying something important? Are they rushing to a crucial appointment?
* **Use Active Voice:** Rewrite the sentences in active voice to make the writing more direct and impactful. For example: "The cleaner had just finished mopping the stairs and left without putting up a 'wet floor' sign."

This paragraph scores a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Building Tension:** The paragraph sets up a potentially dangerous situation. The men carrying the vital liver are about to walk down a wet staircase without a warning sign.
* **Sense of Inevitability:** The phrase "including yours decides des walk down" suggests that the men are making a fateful decision, increasing the tension.
* **Grammatical Errors:** The awkward phrasing and grammatical errors detract from the suspense. They make it harder for the reader to fully immerse themselves in the scene.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Clarify the Situation:**  Make it clearer who "yours" refers to. Is it one of the men carrying the liver, or is it someone else who is about to walk down the stairs?
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating that they "decide to walk down," describe their actions and thoughts. Are they rushing? Are they aware of the danger?

This paragraph scores a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:
