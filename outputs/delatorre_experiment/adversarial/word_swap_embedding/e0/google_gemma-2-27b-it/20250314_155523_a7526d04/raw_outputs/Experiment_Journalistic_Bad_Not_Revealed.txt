I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing make it difficult to follow the story and build tension. 
* **Lack of Vivid Language:** The writing lacks sensory details and strong verbs that could create a sense of urgency or danger.
* **Info Dumping:** The paragraph presents a lot of information upfront (location, date, medical details) without weaving it into a compelling narrative.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammar and sentence structure.**
* **Focus on a specific moment of tension.** Instead of summarizing the situation, zoom in on a particular action or decision.
* **Use vivid language to create a sense of atmosphere and emotion.** Describe the boy's condition, the doctor's anxiety, the ticking clock.
* **Raise questions in the reader's mind.** Hint at potential complications or obstacles.

* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the time (08:57) and the phrase "disembarked timely" create a sense of urgency. We know the organs are crucial and time is of the essence.
* **Vague Language:** The phrase "new ceilings" is unclear and slightly unsettling. It hints at something unusual or potentially dangerous.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Detail:** The "smaller bleu fridge" and the mention of a "totally functioning liver" pique the reader's curiosity. It suggests something important and potentially fragile is being transported.
* **Unclear Pronouns:** The use of "someone del whom" is confusing and creates a slight sense of unease. Who is this person? What is their role?
* **Lack of Context:** We still don't have a clear understanding of the situation or the stakes involved.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Clarify the pronouns:**  Identify the person carrying the fridge and their relationship to the situation.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Hint at the potential consequences if the liver is damaged or delayed.
* **Use stronger verbs and sensory details:** Instead of "carries," use a more active verb like "rushed" or "sprinted." Describe the feel of the cold fridge, the sound of hurried footsteps.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Connection:** This paragraph feels disconnected from the previous ones. The focus on the cleaner and the "wet flooring" sign doesn't seem relevant to the central tension of the organ transplant.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("had completed hoovering") makes the writing feel distant and unemotional.
* **No Immediate Threat:** There's no clear sense of danger or urgency in this paragraph.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Connect it to the main plot:** How does the wet floor sign relate to Robert's surgery or the arrival of the organs? Perhaps it creates an obstacle or a potential hazard.
* **Use active voice and strong verbs:**  Show the cleaner rushing to finish, maybe even slipping on the wet floor, adding a sense of chaos.
* **Foreshadow danger:**  Hint that the wet floor could pose a risk to someone or something important.



Remember, every detail should contribute to the overall suspense and keep the reader engaged.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Unusual Action:** The men choosing to "promenade descending" with a vital organ is unexpected and slightly unsettling. It suggests a lack of urgency or perhaps even carelessness.
* **Vague Setting:** "Nova serving stairway" is a bit unclear. Is it a hospital stairway? A service entrance? This vagueness adds a touch of mystery.
* **Lack of Clarity:** The sentence structure is a bit awkward, making it harder to fully grasp the situation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Clarify the setting:** Describe the stairway in more detail. Is it dimly lit? Crowded? Does it feel ominous?
* **Heighten the stakes:** Emphasize the importance of the liver arriving safely and on time. What are the consequences if they are delayed?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying they "decided to promenade," describe their movements. Are they walking quickly? Carefully? Are they talking?

Remember, suspense is built through details, pacing, and creating a sense of anticipation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Sudden Shift:** The paragraph abruptly shifts from a relatively calm scene to a moment of crisis. The man slipping and the case tumbling creates a jolt of surprise and concern.
* **High Stakes:** We know the case contains a vital organ, so the fall immediately raises the stakes and creates a sense of dread.
* **Vivid Imagery:** The phrase "tumbled downstairs the stairways" paints a clear picture of the accident, making it more impactful.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Slow down the action:** Describe the slip in more detail. What caused it? How did the man react?
* **Focus on the sound and movement:** Describe the clattering of the case as it falls, the echoing sound in the stairwell.
* **Leave the outcome uncertain:** Don't immediately reveal the fate of the liver. Let the reader wonder if it was damaged.



This paragraph has a good foundation for suspense. By adding more sensory details and prolonging the moment of uncertainty, you can make it even more gripping.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Rising Tension:** The immediate action of the colleagues warning the doctors creates a sense of urgency and impending danger.
* **Unclear Outcome:** The phrase "whose stood not handled during all road" is a bit confusing, but it suggests the liver is vulnerable and potentially in danger.
* **Focus on the Individual:** The man staying to supervise adds a personal element to the suspense. We're invested in his actions and the outcome.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Clarify the situation:**  Make it clearer what "not handled" means. Is the case damaged? Is the liver exposed?
* **Show the man's emotions:** Describe his fear, anxiety, or determination as he waits for the doctors.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the ticking clock, the sound of his own breathing, the sterile smell of the hospital.

Remember, suspense is about creating anticipation and uncertainty. Keep the reader guessing about what will happen next.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Detail:** The sentence is very short and lacks any descriptive language. We don't know anything about the doctors' reactions or the atmosphere when they arrive.
* **Anti-climactic:** After building tension in the previous paragraphs, this sentence feels like a letdown. It doesn't offer any new information or raise the stakes.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show the man's reaction:** Does he feel relief? Fear? Hope?
* **Hint at the potential consequences:**  Is the liver still viable? Will Robert survive?

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Technical Language:** The use of medical jargon like "hepatic pilot" and "biopsy" creates a sense of urgency and seriousness, but it might also alienate readers who are unfamiliar with these terms.
* **Unclear Actions:** The sentence structure is a bit convoluted, making it difficult to fully grasp what's happening. What exactly are the doctors doing with the case?
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** We don't get a sense of the doctors' emotions or the gravity of the situation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Simplify the language:** Use more accessible terms to describe the doctors' actions.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that they took the case for a biopsy, describe the process. What tools are they using? What are they looking for?
* **Highlight the emotional stakes:** Describe the doctors' anxiety, their hope that the liver can be salvaged.

* **Introduce a glimmer of hope:** Perhaps there's another option, a last-minute solution. This could create a sense of anticipation and keep the reader invested.
