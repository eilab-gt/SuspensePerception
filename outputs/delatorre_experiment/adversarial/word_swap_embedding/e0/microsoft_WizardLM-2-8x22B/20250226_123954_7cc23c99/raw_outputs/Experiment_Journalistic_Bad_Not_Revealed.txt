The paragraph sets up a scenario with inherent tension—a young boy in critical condition awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the suitability of the donor and the uncertainty of the boy's survival creates a sense of urgency and concern for the outcome. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph presents a past event with a narrative tone, signaling that the story has already concluded. The suspense could be heightened with more immediate and vivid details, a focus on the emotional states of the characters involved, and by not revealing whether the transplant was successful, thus keeping the reader in greater suspense about the outcome.

This paragraph introduces a moment of action and critical timing that adds to the suspense. The precision of the time and the mention of the organ's arrival by helicopter create a sense of urgency. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph provides a clear and positive update on the situation (the helicopter arrived "punctually," and Robert is in a "stable condition"). The suspense could be heightened by adding elements of uncertainty or potential complications that could still arise, or by withholding information about the condition of the organ or Robert's immediate response to the arrival of the helicopter.

This paragraph adds a layer of detail to the unfolding event, which contributes to the suspense by focusing on the precious cargo—the liver stored in a small blue fridge. The specificity of the "small blue fridge" and the mention of the liver being "fully functioning" create a tangible sense of the stakes involved. However, the suspense is moderated by the fact that the paragraph is descriptive and does not introduce immediate threats or complications. The suspense could be intensified by hinting at potential risks during the transportation of the liver or by creating a sense of urgency in the actions of the men carrying it.

This paragraph introduces a new element of suspense that is quite effective. The mention of the cleaner who has just mopped the floor and failed to display a "wet floors" sign creates a sense of impending danger that is not directly related to the medical procedure but could have serious consequences. The reader is likely to anticipate a potential accident or complication due to the slippery floors, which adds tension to the scenario. The timing is critical ("minutes earlier"), suggesting that the characters, including the men carrying the liver, might soon encounter this unseen hazard. This creates a sense of foreboding and raises the stakes, as the reader is made aware of a risk of which the characters are likely unaware.

This paragraph builds on the suspense established in the previous one by directly connecting the characters to the potential hazard. The reader is aware of the danger posed by the wet floors in the service stairwell, which heightens the tension as the two men, carrying the crucial liver, make the decision to use that very stairwell. The act of walking down the stairs, as opposed to taking a safer route (such as an elevator), introduces an element of risk and the possibility of an accident that could jeopardize the transplant. The suspense is moderately high because the reader is anticipating a critical moment that could lead to a significant complication in the story.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense as it describes the immediate consequence of the hazard introduced earlier. The slip of the man carrying the liver case creates a moment of high tension and danger. The use of the word "plunged" to describe the case's descent down the stairs suggests a rapid and uncontrolled fall, which could potentially damage the organ and jeopardize the entire transplant operation. The reader is likely to be highly engaged at this point, concerned about the outcome of the fall and its impact on the young boy's chances of survival. The suspense is high because the paragraph presents a critical and unexpected event that puts the central element of the story—the liver transplant—in immediate peril.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by focusing on the immediate reactions of the characters to the crisis. The colleague's decision to rush and warn the doctors introduces a sense of urgency and the need for quick action. Meanwhile, the man who slipped is portrayed as staying with the case, ensuring it is not mishandled further, which adds to the tension as the reader wonders about the condition of the liver inside. The phrase "until the doctors arrives" suggests a period of anxious waiting, during which the fate of the organ—and, by extension, the young boy—hangs in the balance. The suspense is sustained by the uncertainty of the situation and the potential consequences of the fall, keeping the reader engaged and concerned about the outcome.

This paragraph provides a moment of relief in the narrative, which reduces the suspense built up in the previous sections. The prompt arrival of the doctor suggests that immediate medical attention is being given to the situation, which could help mitigate any potential damage from the fall. While the reader may still be concerned about the condition of the liver and the outcome of the transplant, the straightforward and positive action of the doctor's arrival lowers the tension slightly. The suspense could be heightened if the paragraph included more details about the doctor's reaction to the situation or if it hinted at further complications that the doctor might face upon arrival. As it stands, the paragraph serves more as a transition in the story, indicating a shift in the response to the crisis rather than a peak of suspense.

This paragraph raises the suspense to a high level by introducing a significant and unexpected complication. The revelation that the interior bag containing the liver has ruptured creates a moment of intense concern for the reader. The focus on the case being opened and the discovery of the rupture heightens the drama, as it directly impacts the viability of the liver for transplant. The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the liver and whether it can still be used, which is critical to the life of the young boy awaiting the transplant. This moment is filled with tension and uncertainty, key elements for creating a sense of suspense in the narrative.

This paragraph maintains a moderate to high level of suspense by focusing on the medical team's response to the crisis. The action of taking the case to the hepatic laboratory for further examination suggests that the doctors are doing everything they can to assess the situation and make an informed decision about the liver's usability. The mention of a biopsy to study the organ's status introduces a period of waiting for the results, which can be quite suspenseful for the reader. The outcome of the biopsy is uncertain, and the stakes are high, as it will determine whether the transplant can proceed. While the paragraph does not describe an immediate threat or action-packed event, it effectively sustains the tension by highlighting the critical nature of the ongoing medical evaluation.

This paragraph delivers a significant plot twist that heightens the suspense by revealing the negative outcome of the biopsy. The news that the liver has not survived the impact and cannot be used for the transplant introduces a major setback in the narrative, raising the stakes and creating a sense of desperation. The reader is likely to feel a surge of suspense at this point, as the young boy's life hangs in the balance and the medical team faces the challenge of finding an alternative solution under time pressure. The paragraph effectively conveys a critical moment of failure and uncertainty, which are key components of suspenseful storytelling.

This paragraph concludes the narrative with a tragic outcome, which in itself is not suspenseful since it reveals the resolution of the central conflict—the fate of Robert Bent. The mention of the exact time of death adds a somber note to the story and underscores the gravity of the situation. However, from a suspense perspective, the suspense has largely dissipated because the reader is informed of the final outcome. The paragraph serves more as a closure to the story, providing a definitive end to the tension that was built up throughout the narrative. While there is a sense of finality and the emotional impact of the young boy's death, the suspense is resolved, and the story has reached its conclusion.
