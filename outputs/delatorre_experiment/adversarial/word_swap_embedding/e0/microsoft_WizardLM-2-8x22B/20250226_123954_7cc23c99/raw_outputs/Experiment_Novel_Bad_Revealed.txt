The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical medical situation involving a young boy in dire need of a liver transplant. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before creates a sense of urgency and hope, which is then juxtaposed with the uncertainty of whether the boy will survive the wait. The specificity of the time (21:26) and the tragic outcome—the death of Roberta Bent without the transplant occurring—adds to the suspense by revealing the stakes and the emotional weight of the situation. The final line hints at a story behind the events, inviting the reader to explore further, which also contributes to the suspensefulness.

This paragraph has elements that could contribute to suspense, such as the precise timing of the helicopter's arrival and the mention of a critical but stable condition of a patient. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph lacks detail about the context of the helicopter's arrival, the nature of the agencies involved, and the specific dangers or challenges facing Robert Bent. The phrase "critical but stable" suggests a precarious situation, but without further information about the risks or potential outcomes, the suspense is not as strongly developed as it could be.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful. It paints a vivid picture of the urgency and high stakes involved in the situation. The description of the men descending from the helicopter with a vital organ in tow, the need to communicate non-verbally due to the noise, and the emphasis on the critical condition of the patient all contribute to a sense of tension and urgency. The specific detail of the blue case maintaining the liver at a precise temperature adds to the authenticity and seriousness of the scenario. The final sentence, emphasizing the time-sensitive nature of the mission, leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the potential consequences should anything go wrong, heightening the suspense.

This paragraph has a lower level of suspense because it focuses on the routine and mundane aspects of a hospital cleaner's job. The description of the cleaner's daily routine, his preference for cleaning the corridors over the service stairwell, and his habit of whistling while he works does not immediately suggest any impending danger or critical event. The mention of the "moist floor" signs could imply a potential hazard, but without any direct connection to an urgent situation or any indication that something out of the ordinary is about to happen, the suspense is minimal. The paragraph serves more to set a scene and establish a character rather than to build suspense.

This paragraph builds a moderate level of suspense. It provides a detailed layout of the hospital's infrastructure, which sets the stage for the urgency of the situation as the characters navigate through the less-traveled parts of the hospital to deliver the liver. The specific mention of the service stairwell and the decision to avoid the lift due to time constraints creates a sense of urgency and suggests that every second counts. The reader is aware that the characters are carrying a life-saving organ, and the description of the hospital's layout implies potential obstacles and the need for quick thinking. The suspense arises from the anticipation of whether they will successfully navigate these obstacles and reach the patient in time.

The specific sensory detail of the sound of the case tumbling down the steps adds to the suspense by emphasizing the chaotic nature of the incident.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The moment the case containing the liver comes to a stop is a critical juncture, and the three-second pause before the men react adds to the tension. The warning from one character to the other about the potential damage to the liver and the decision to call the doctors rather than risk further harm by moving the case themselves underscores the gravity of the situation. The urgency is further heightened by the immediate action taken by one of the men to seek medical assistance, emphasizing the need for haste and the potential consequences if the liver has been compromised. The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the liver and the outcome for the patient, as well as the reaction of the medical team to this unexpected development.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense. The focus on the colleague who remains still, holding onto the bannister and trying not to think about the potential damage to the liver, creates a tense atmosphere. His injury and the superstitious belief that his endurance of pain is linked to the liver's condition add a layer of emotional depth to the situation. The arrival of the doctors, described as rushing up the stairwell, conveys the urgency of the response. The reader is kept in suspense as the doctors finally appear and one of them immediately attends to the case, with the phrase "Move aside, please" suggesting the need for immediate action and the importance of the moment. The suspense is sustained as the paragraph ends without revealing the condition of the liver or the outcome for the patient.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. The detailed description of the doctor opening the case, the anticipatory sound of a click, and the revelation of the inner padding designed to protect the liver all build tension. The doctor's reaction, shaking her head, is a clear signal that something has gone wrong, which heightens the suspense. The specific mention of the fridge being ruptured with a long split and the escape of refrigerated air provides a tangible sense of the damage and its potential implications for the organ's viability. The reader is left in suspense, as the paragraph concludes with the case being closed, without any direct confirmation of the liver's condition or what this means for the patient's transplant.

This paragraph is extremely suspenseful. It describes a critical and delicate medical procedure with high stakes—the life of a child hangs in the balance. The detailed account of the liver's transfer to the hepatology laboratory and the initial signs of the organ's health create a sense of cautious optimism, which is then juxtaposed with the need for a risky biopsy to assess the metabolic rate. The surgeon's nervousness and the precision required for the procedure (one millimetre could mean the difference between success and irreparable damage) add to the tension. The image of everyone else in the laboratory stepping back to give the surgeon space emphasizes the gravity of the moment. The reader is left in suspense, waiting to see if the surgeon's skill will be enough to save the child's life.

The surgeon's physical reactions—pursing his lips and blinking—suggest a critical evaluation is taking place. The concluding sentence, revealing that the organ has deteriorated due to the impact, delivers a dramatic twist that significantly raises the stakes and leaves the reader with a cliffhanger regarding the patient's fate.

The suspense arises from the anticipation built up around the transplant's success and the abrupt end to the patient's life despite the team's best efforts.
