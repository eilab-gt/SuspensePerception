The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical medical situation involving a young boy awaiting a liver transplant. The mention of the boy's critical condition and the urgency of the situation (since 8 a.m., the mention of a suitable donor found just the day before) creates a sense of tension and uncertainty about the outcome. The reader is left wondering whether Robert will survive the wait and what complications might arise, which are elements that contribute to a suspenseful narrative. The open-ended conclusion of the paragraph, "This is the story of what happened," invites the reader to continue reading to discover the resolution, thus maintaining the suspense.

This paragraph begins to resolve some of the tension built up in the previous narrative by indicating that the organ has arrived at the hospital. The mention of Robert Bent being in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that he has managed to hold on until the arrival of the organ, which provides some relief from the suspense. However, the use of "critical" also maintains a level of concern for the boy's well-being. The precise timing of the helicopter's landing ("At 08:57") adds a sense of urgency and precision to the situation, which contributes to the suspense. Overall, while there is still some uncertainty regarding the outcome of the transplant, the suspense level is moderately reduced compared to the previous paragraph.

This paragraph introduces a new element of suspense by focusing on the delicate process of transporting the liver. The specific detail of the "small blue fridge, in the shape of a case," used to store the liver, creates a vivid image and underscores the importance and fragility of the cargo. The mention of the liver being "fully functioning" is a positive sign, but the fact that it is being transported by hand from the helicopter introduces a new point of potential failure or complication. The reader is likely to be invested in the safe delivery of the organ to the operating room, thus maintaining a level of suspense. The actions of the two men carrying the liver also suggest a moment of transition, which can be a critical juncture in the story, adding to the suspenseful atmosphere.

This paragraph introduces a potential hazard that could impact the critical situation previously described. The mention of the cleaner finishing mopping and failing to display a "wet floor" sign creates a sense of foreboding, as it suggests the possibility of an accident occurring in the service stairwell. This new element of risk adds a layer of suspense, as the reader is now aware of an unrelated but potentially complicating factor that could affect the safe transport of the liver or the well-being of the medical team. The timing is also crucial ("Minute earlier"), implying that the unsafe condition of the floor could intersect with the events unfolding. However, the suspense is somewhat muted because the paragraph is disconnected from the immediate action surrounding the liver transport and Robert's condition, focusing instead on a background detail that may or may not become significant.

This paragraph heightens the suspense by directly connecting the potential hazard (the wet floor in the service stairwell) with the critical action of the story (the transport of the liver). The decision of the two men to use the service stairwell raises the stakes, as the reader is already aware of the unmarked wet floor, which could lead to a slip or fall, jeopardizing the safety of the organ and potentially the lives of those involved. The specific choice to walk down the stairs, rather than taking an elevator or another route, adds an element of risk and invites the reader to anticipate a possible accident. The suspense is elevated by the reader's knowledge of the danger that the characters are unknowingly heading towards.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level by directly confronting the characters with the danger that was previously set up. The slip of one of the men carrying the case with the liver is a critical moment that the reader has been led to anticipate. The description of the case "plunging down the stairs" creates a vivid image of chaos and potential disaster, which is highly suspenseful. The reader is left to worry about the condition of the liver post-fall, the well-being of the man who slipped, and the implications for Robert Bent's transplant. The use of the word "infantry" suggests a heavy, forceful step, which may indicate the severity of the fall and the damage that could have been done. The suspense is high as the reader is eager to know the consequences of this accident.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by detailing the immediate aftermath of the accident and the urgent response it triggers. The action of one man going to alert the doctors while the other stays with the case emphasizes the gravity of the situation and the need for quick decision-making. The instruction not to handle the case until the doctors arrive suggests that any mishandling could compromise the liver's viability, which adds to the tension. The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the liver, whether it can still be used for the transplant, and the potential impact on Robert Bent's life. The focus on the careful supervision of the case without any physical interaction with it creates a sense of urgency and concern, keeping the reader engaged and anxious to learn the outcome.

This paragraph provides a moment of relief from the heightened suspense by indicating that help has arrived quickly. The prompt arrival of the physicians suggests that the response to the emergency was efficient, which could mitigate the potential negative consequences of the case falling down the stairs. While the reader's concern about the liver's condition and the fate of Robert Bent's transplant is still present, the immediate and swift response from the medical team reduces the level of suspense. The paragraph serves as a transition that acknowledges the urgency of the situation but does not yet reveal the outcome, leaving the reader with questions about what happens next. The suspense is moderate, as the reader anticipates the doctors' assessment and the implications for the story's resolution.

This paragraph re-escalates the suspense by introducing a new complication that directly affects the condition of the liver. The revelation that the interior rucksack within the case has ruptured raises immediate concerns about the organ's safety and whether it has been damaged during the fall. The reader is likely to be highly invested in the integrity of the liver, as it is crucial for Robert Bent's transplant. The suspense is heightened by the fact that the doctors have just arrived and are now faced with an unexpected setback, which could have serious implications for the surgery. The paragraph leaves the reader with several critical questions: Is the liver still usable? What will this mean for Robert's chances of survival? The suspense level is high as the reader is left hanging on the edge, awaiting the doctors' next actions and the consequences of this discovery.

This paragraph sustains a moderate level of suspense by focusing on the medical team's immediate response to the potential problem with the liver. The decision to take the case to the hepatic laboratory for further examination indicates that the doctors are taking the situation seriously and are working to assess the damage. The surgeon's action of performing a biopsy to determine the organ's condition keeps the reader engaged, as this process will reveal critical information about the liver's viability for transplant. The suspense arises from the anticipation of the biopsy results and the uncertainty of whether the liver can still be used to save Robert Bent's life. While the paragraph suggests a methodical and professional approach to dealing with the crisis, the outcome remains uncertain, maintaining the reader's suspense.

This paragraph provides a resolution to the immediate suspense regarding the liver's condition but still maintains a level of tension due to the transplant's inherent risks. The analysis revealing that the liver has withstood the impact and is still viable for transplant offers a sense of relief and a positive turn in the narrative. However, the use of phrases like "it was possible" suggests that there may still be concerns or reduced odds of success due to the organ's rough handling. The reader's suspense is reduced by the good news but remains present because the transplant has not yet occurred, and the outcome is not guaranteed. The paragraph serves as a transition from the uncertainty of the liver's viability to the anticipation of the transplant's success, keeping the reader invested in Robert Bent's fate.

This paragraph significantly reduces the suspense by confirming that the transplant was successful and that the liver is functioning correctly despite the earlier mishap. The specific time stamp ("at 21:26") gives a sense of closure to the event, indicating that the medical team has closely monitored the situation and is satisfied with the results. The reader's tension is largely resolved with the assurance that the liver was not affected by the damage it sustained during transit, and Robert Bent's prognosis appears to be good. While there may still be concerns about post-operative recovery and potential complications, the main source of suspense—the viability and functionality of the transplanted liver—has been positively addressed. The paragraph serves as a conclusion to the immediate drama, providing a sense of relief and reducing the suspense level.
