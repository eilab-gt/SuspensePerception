I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The mention of the patient's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense.

Additionally, the paragraph is more informative and factual than it is suspenseful, which also affects the rating.

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by emphasizing the importance of speed and the critical condition of the patient. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "blue case", helps to create a sense of immediacy and importance.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is a detailed and mundane description of a cleaner's daily routine, with no hint of tension, suspense, or excitement. The use of phrases such as "it wasn't a particularly interesting job" and "it was an agreeable job" reinforces the idea that this is a routine and uneventful task. The description of the service stairwell as "dull" and the lack of anything needing a thorough clean further emphasizes the lack of suspense. The paragraph is more focused on providing a detailed and realistic portrayal of the cleaner's daily routine than on building tension or suspense. Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful at all.
