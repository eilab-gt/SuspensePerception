I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a specific and real-time context, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The introduction of a critical situation, with a child's life hanging in the balance, creates a sense of urgency and tension.
* The use of specific details, such as the time of day and the medical team's preparations, adds to the sense of realism and makes the situation feel more immediate.
* The twist at the end, where the child dies despite the team's efforts, is a shocking and unexpected turn of events that creates a sense of surprise and shock.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension and suspense more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.
* Provided more emotional context and character development to make the reader more invested in Robert's fate.
* Used more vivid and descriptive language to paint a more vivid picture of the scene and the emotions involved.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys a sense of suspense, but could benefit from a few tweaks to make it even more engaging and emotionally resonant.

The paragraph is somewhat lacking in suspense because it's a relatively straightforward and factual description of an event, without much emotional resonance or surprise.
