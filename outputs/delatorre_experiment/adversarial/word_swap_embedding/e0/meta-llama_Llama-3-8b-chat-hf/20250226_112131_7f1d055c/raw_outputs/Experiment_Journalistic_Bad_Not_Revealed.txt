I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a real-life event and a critical situation (Robert's condition).

* The mention of a suitable donor being discovered and the team waiting for the organ creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind (e.g., will Robert survive the wait?).
* However, the paragraph is relatively straightforward and lacks a strong sense of surprise or unexpected twists, which are key elements of suspense.

To increase the suspensefulness of this paragraph, the writer could consider adding more dramatic language, creating a sense of uncertainty or ambiguity, or introducing a hint of danger or conflict. For example, they could describe Robert's condition as "grave" or "life-threatening," or mention that the team is racing against the clock to save his life.
