I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is written in a formal and technical tone, which makes it difficult to create a sense of tension or suspense. The language is also quite dry and lacks vivid descriptions or emotional appeals that could draw the reader in. The story itself is also quite straightforward and lacks any real surprises or twists, which makes it hard to build suspense. The only slightly suspenseful moment is the mention of Roberto's critical situation, but it's not enough to create a sense of urgency or tension. Overall, the paragraph is more informative and factual than suspenseful.

The sudden and rapid landing of the helicopter also creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what is happening and why the helicopter is landing so quickly. The brevity of the paragraph and the lack of additional context also adds to the suspense, as it leaves the reader wondering what will happen next. However, the paragraph is still somewhat limited in its ability to create suspense due to its brevity and the lack of additional details or plot twists.
