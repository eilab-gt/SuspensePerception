* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing context, which is informative but not particularly suspenseful.

* The final sentence, "It is du story de whereof happened," is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't provide much resolution or payoff, which might leave the reader feeling a bit unsatisfied.
