I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is written in a somewhat awkward and unclear style, which makes it difficult to follow and understand. The use of French phrases and words without proper translation or explanation also adds to the confusion.

Additionally, the paragraph lacks a clear sense of tension or urgency, which is a key element of suspense. The story is told in a matter-of-fact way, without any sense of danger or uncertainty. The reader is not given any reason to be concerned about the outcome of the story, and the lack of emotional investment makes it hard to feel suspenseful.

Overall, the paragraph is more confusing and unclear than suspenseful, and it fails to engage the reader in a way that would create a sense of tension or uncertainty.
