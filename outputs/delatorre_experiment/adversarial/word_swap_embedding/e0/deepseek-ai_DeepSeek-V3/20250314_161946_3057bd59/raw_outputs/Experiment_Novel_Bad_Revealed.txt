I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here’s why:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and mixed languages (e.g., French and English). This makes it hard to build suspense because the reader is distracted by the confusion.

2. **Emotional Engagement**: While the subject matter (a child’s failed liver transplant) is inherently emotional, the writing does not effectively convey the tension or stakes. The emotional weight is lost in the disjointed narrative.

3. **Pacing and Build-Up**: There is no clear build-up of tension. The paragraph jumps from one point to another without creating a sense of anticipation or urgency.

4. **Resolution**: The outcome (Robert’s death) is stated abruptly without any dramatic reveal or emotional impact, which diminishes the potential for suspense.

Overall, the paragraph lacks the elements necessary to create suspense, such as clear storytelling, emotional engagement, and a well-paced build-up.

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The sentence is somewhat clearer than the previous example, but it still contains awkward phrasing and grammatical issues (e.g., "per helicopter transport onto agency landed timely regarding to ceilings de the hospitals"). This makes it harder to fully engage with the scenario.

2. **Emotional Engagement**: The mention of a "crucial but stabilize condition" hints at stakes, but the writing doesn’t delve into the emotional or physical state of Kathleen Crooked or the urgency of the situation. This limits the reader’s ability to feel invested.

4. **Resolution**: There is no resolution or cliffhanger here, which could have added suspense. The sentence ends abruptly without leaving the reader wondering what happens next.

While the paragraph introduces a potentially suspenseful scenario (a helicopter transport for someone in critical condition), the execution lacks the necessary elements to make it truly suspenseful.
