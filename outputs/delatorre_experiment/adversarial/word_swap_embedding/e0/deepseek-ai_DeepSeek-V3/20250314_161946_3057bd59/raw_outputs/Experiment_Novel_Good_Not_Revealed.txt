I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation—a young boy awaiting a critical liver transplant with uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait. The stakes are high, and the context is emotionally charged.

Overall, while the premise has potential, the execution does not effectively build suspense.
