I would rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph sets up a potentially tense situation with a young boy awaiting a critical liver transplant. The mention of uncertainty about whether he would survive the wait adds some suspense.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is undermined by the way the information is presented. The paragraph reveals the outcome too early (the liver functioning correctly), which reduces the tension. Additionally, the writing style is somewhat disjointed and lacks vivid details or emotional depth that could heighten the suspense. The grammatical errors and awkward phrasing also detract from the overall impact.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could focus more on the uncertainty, the stakes, and the emotional weight of the situation, while withholding the outcome until the end.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:
