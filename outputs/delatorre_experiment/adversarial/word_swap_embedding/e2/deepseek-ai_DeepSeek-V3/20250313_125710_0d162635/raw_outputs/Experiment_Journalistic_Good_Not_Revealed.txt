I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, mixed languages, and unclear phrasing. This makes it hard to build suspense because the reader struggles to understand the situation.

2. **Setup for Suspense**: While the scenario (a child awaiting a kidney transplant) has potential for suspense, the execution doesn't effectively build tension. The stakes are mentioned (Richard's critical condition), but the writing doesn't create a sense of urgency or emotional investment.

3. **Pacing**: The pacing is slow and disjointed, which detracts from any potential suspense. The paragraph feels more like an introduction than a gripping narrative.

To increase suspense, the writing could focus on clearer language, emotional depth, and a more immediate sense of danger or uncertainty.
