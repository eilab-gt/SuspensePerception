I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here’s why:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, mixed languages, and unclear phrasing. This makes it hard to build suspense because the reader struggles to understand the situation.

2. **Setup for Suspense**: While there is a potentially suspenseful scenario (a child awaiting a critical kidney transplant), the way it’s presented lacks tension. The stakes are mentioned, but the emotional weight and urgency are not effectively conveyed.

3. **Pacing and Detail**: The paragraph jumps between details without building a sense of anticipation. For example, the mention of the donor being found the day before reduces the immediate tension, and the lack of vivid descriptions or emotional depth makes it hard to feel invested.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could focus on the uncertainty of the situation, the emotional stakes for the characters, and the ticking clock of the impending transplant. Clearer language and a more structured narrative would also help.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here’s why:

1. **Potential for Suspense**: The scenario—a helicopter crash on a hospital roof while a patient is in critical condition—has inherent suspense. However, the execution doesn’t fully capitalize on this potential.

2. **Clarity and Detail**: The paragraph is confusing due to grammatical errors and mixed languages (e.g., "per helicopter," "du body," "aux the hospitalized"). This makes it hard to understand the situation clearly, which diminishes the suspense.

3. **Emotional Impact**: The stakes are mentioned (Kathleen is in a critical condition), but there’s no emotional depth or vivid description to make the reader feel the urgency or danger. The lack of context about Kathleen or the helicopter crash also reduces the tension.

4. **Pacing**: The sentence is abrupt and doesn’t build anticipation. A more structured narrative with details about the crash, the hospital’s reaction, or Kathleen’s condition would heighten the suspense.

To improve, the paragraph could focus on the chaos of the crash, the immediate danger to Kathleen, and the uncertainty of the situation. Clearer language and more descriptive details would also help.

4. **Pacing and Detail**: The paragraph is too brief and lacks descriptive details that could build suspense. For example, it doesn’t describe the condition of the helicopter, the urgency of the situation, or the potential risks involved.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could focus on the urgency of the liver transplant, the condition of the helicopter, and the potential consequences if the liver doesn’t arrive in time. Clearer language and more vivid descriptions would also help.
