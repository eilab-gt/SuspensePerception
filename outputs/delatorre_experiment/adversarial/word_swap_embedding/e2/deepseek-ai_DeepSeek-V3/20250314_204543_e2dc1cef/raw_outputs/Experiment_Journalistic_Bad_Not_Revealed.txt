I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and inconsistent language (e.g., mixing English with French-like words). This makes it hard to build suspense because the reader is distracted by trying to decipher the meaning.

2. **Emotional Engagement**: While the situation (a young boy awaiting a kidney transplant) is inherently tense, the writing does not effectively convey the urgency or emotional stakes. The lack of vivid details or emotional depth reduces the suspense.

3. **Pacing and Structure**: The paragraph does not build tension effectively. It introduces the situation but does not escalate the stakes or create a sense of impending danger or uncertainty in a compelling way.

Overall, the potential for suspense is there, but the execution falls short due to unclear writing and a lack of emotional and narrative tension.
