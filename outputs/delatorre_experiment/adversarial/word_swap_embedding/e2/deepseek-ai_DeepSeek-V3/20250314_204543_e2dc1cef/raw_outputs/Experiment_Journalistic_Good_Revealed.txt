I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, mixed languages, and unclear phrasing. This makes it hard to build suspense because the reader is distracted by trying to decipher the meaning.

2. **Stakes and Tension**: While the situation (a liver transplant for a critically ill boy) is inherently tense, the writing doesn't effectively convey the urgency or emotional weight of the moment. The stakes are mentioned but not deeply felt.

3. **Pacing and Structure**: The paragraph jumps between details without building a clear narrative arc. The resolution (the liver functioning properly) is mentioned abruptly, which diminishes any potential suspense.

4. **Emotional Engagement**: The writing lacks vivid descriptions or emotional depth, which are crucial for creating suspense. The reader doesn't feel deeply connected to the characters or their plight.

Overall, while the subject matter has potential for suspense, the execution falls short due to unclear writing and lack of emotional engagement.
