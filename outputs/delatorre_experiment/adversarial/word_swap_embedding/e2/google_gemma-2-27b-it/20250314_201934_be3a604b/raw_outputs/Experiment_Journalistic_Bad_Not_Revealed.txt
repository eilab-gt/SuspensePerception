I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing make it difficult to follow the story and build tension. 
* **Lack of Vivid Language:** The writing lacks sensory details and strong verbs that could create a sense of urgency or danger.
* **Info Dumping:** The paragraph presents a lot of information upfront (location, date, medical details) without weaving it into a compelling narrative.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammar and sentence structure.**
* **Focus on a specific moment of tension.** Instead of summarizing the situation, zoom in on a particular action or decision.
* **Use vivid language to create a sense of atmosphere and emotion.** Describe the boy's condition, the doctor's anxiety, the ticking clock.
* **Raise questions in the reader's mind.** Hint at potential complications or obstacles.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the time (08:57) and the phrase "disembarked timely" create a sense of urgency. We know the organs are crucial and time is of the essence.
* **Vague Language:** The phrase "new ceilings" is unclear and slightly unsettling. It hints at something unusual or potentially dangerous.
* **Robert's Condition:** The description of Robert's condition as "latest critical though stabilise" is intriguing. It suggests a precarious situation where things could go either way.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his symptoms or the doctors' reactions.
* **Build anticipation:**  Focus on the journey of the organs, perhaps highlighting potential obstacles or delays.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the sterile environment of the hospital, the tension in the air.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Detail:** The "smaller bleu fridge" and the mention of a "totally functioning liver" pique the reader's curiosity. It suggests something important and potentially fragile is being transported.
* **Unclear Pronouns:** The use of "someone del whom" is confusing and creates a slight sense of unease. Who is this person? What is their role?
* **Lack of Context:** We don't know enough about the situation to feel truly invested. Why is the liver so important? What are the stakes?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Clarify the pronouns:**  Identify the person carrying the fridge and their relationship to the situation.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Hint at the potential consequences if the liver is damaged or delayed.
* **Use stronger verbs and sensory details:** Instead of "carries," use a more active verb like "rushed" or "sprinted." Describe the weight of the fridge, the coldness emanating from it, the urgency in the person's movements.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Connection:** This paragraph feels disconnected from the previous ones. The focus on the cleaner and the "wet flooring" sign doesn't seem relevant to the central tension of the organ transplant.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("had completed hoovering," "leaving or display") creates a sense of distance and detachment.
* **No Immediate Threat:** There's no clear sense of danger or impending disaster.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Connect it to the main plot:**  How does the wet floor sign relate to the organ transplant? Could it pose a danger to the medical team or the organs?
* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps the cleaner accidentally spills something, creating a slippery hazard. Or maybe someone ignores the sign and slips, leading to a chain of events.
* **Use active voice and vivid language:**  Show the cleaner rushing to finish their work, the water pooling on the floor, the reflection of the fluorescent lights.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Unconventional Action:** The image of three men carrying a liver through a sunroof and down a stairway is unusual and slightly unsettling. It suggests a sense of urgency and a disregard for normal procedures.
* **Vague Language:** The phrase "promenade descending" is a bit ambiguous. Are they walking calmly or rushing down the stairs? This lack of clarity adds to the suspense.
* **Lack of Context:** We still don't know why they're taking this unusual route. Is there a problem with the elevators? Are they trying to avoid someone?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the weight of the liver, the sound of their footsteps echoing in the stairwell, the smell of disinfectant.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Hint at the potential consequences if they're delayed or if something goes wrong.
* **Introduce an obstacle:** Perhaps they encounter someone on the stairs, or the lights suddenly go out.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Sudden Shift:** The paragraph abruptly shifts from a relatively calm scene to a moment of chaos and danger. The unexpected slip and the tumbling case create a jolt for the reader.
* **High Stakes:** We know the case contains a vital organ, so the fall immediately raises the stakes. The reader is left wondering about the condition of the liver and the potential consequences.
* **Vague Description:** The writing is a bit unclear. What exactly caused the slip? How far did the case fall? This lack of detail adds to the suspense but also makes it harder to fully visualize the scene.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Slow down the action:** Describe the slip in more detail. Focus on the man's reaction, the sound of the case hitting the stairs, the sickening thud at the bottom.
* **Heighten the emotional impact:** Show the panic of the men, the fear that the liver is ruined.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Mention that time is running out for the patient, adding urgency to the situation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Immediate Action:** The men's quick reaction to warn the doctors creates a sense of urgency. We know something serious has happened.
* **Unclear Consequences:** The paragraph leaves us hanging. What will the doctors do? Is the liver damaged? The lack of information heightens the suspense.
* **Awkward Phrasing:** The sentence structure is a bit clunky and makes it harder to follow the action.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying the men "went aux warn," describe their frantic movements, their worried expressions, their hurried footsteps.
* **Focus on the protagonist's perspective:** What is going through the mind of the man who dropped the case? Is he blaming himself? Is he terrified of the consequences?
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sound of the men's voices, the pounding of their hearts, the sterile smell of the hospital hallway.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Detail:** The sentence is very short and lacks any descriptive language. We don't know anything about the doctors' reactions, their demeanor, or the urgency of the situation.
* **Anti-climactic:** After building suspense in the previous paragraphs, this sentence feels like a letdown. It doesn't provide any new information or raise the stakes.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show the doctors' arrival:** Describe their hurried footsteps, their worried expressions, the way they push past people in the hallway.
* **Highlight their reaction to the situation:** Do they look shocked? Angry? Determined?
* **Add dialogue:** Have the doctors ask questions, express their concerns, or give orders.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Dreadful Discovery:** The revelation that the backpack inside the case has ruptured immediately creates a sense of dread. We know this is bad news for the patient.
* **Vague Language:** The phrase "they discovered whom" is grammatically incorrect and a bit confusing. It would be more effective to say something like "they discovered that" or "to their horror, they saw that."
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** The paragraph doesn't fully convey the emotional weight of the situation. How do the doctors react to this discovery? Are they panicked? Devastated?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Slow down the reveal:** Describe the doctors carefully opening the case, their expressions growing increasingly worried as they see the damage.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the sight of the ruptured backpack, the smell of something unpleasant, the sound of the doctors' gasps.
* **Show the consequences:** What happens next? Do they try to salvage the liver? Do they have to tell the patient's family the bad news?

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Technical Jargon:** The use of medical terms like "hepatic pilot" and "biopsy" creates a sense of seriousness and urgency, but it also makes the paragraph a bit difficult to follow for readers who aren't familiar with medical terminology.
* **Unclear Action:** It's not entirely clear what the doctors are doing. Are they trying to repair the damaged liver? Are they examining it to see if it's still viable?
* **Lack of Emotional Impact:** The paragraph doesn't convey the doctors' feelings of desperation or the patient's precarious situation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Simplify the language:** Use more accessible terms to describe the doctors' actions.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying they took the case "for de hepatic pilot," describe them carefully examining the liver, their faces etched with concern.
* **Raise the stakes:** Hint at the potential consequences if the liver is beyond repair. Will the patient die? Will there be legal repercussions?

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Devastating News:** The revelation that the liver is unusable is a major setback and creates a sense of despair.
* **Unclear Language:** The phrase "ie ai nah resisted du impact" is grammatically incorrect and confusing. It would be more effective to say something like "the liver had sustained too much damage" or "the impact had rendered the liver unusable."
* **Lack of Emotional Response:** The paragraph doesn't convey the doctors' reaction to this devastating news. Are they heartbroken? Angry? Determined to find another solution?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show the doctors' despair:** Describe their expressions, their body language, their hushed voices as they discuss the situation.
* **Highlight the patient's vulnerability:** Remind the reader that a life hangs in the balance.
* **Introduce a glimmer of hope:** Perhaps there's another organ available, or a risky experimental procedure that could be attempted.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Stark Reality:** The blunt statement "the medical team licensed the death of Richard Bent" is a powerful and shocking moment. It brings the consequences of the earlier events into sharp focus.
* **Sense of Finality:** The use of the past tense and the phrase "not having been capacities" emphasizes the irreversibility of the situation.
* **Lingering Questions:** The paragraph leaves us with a sense of sadness and unanswered questions. What happened to the other organs? Will there be an investigation into the accident?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show the emotional impact:** Describe the reactions of the medical team, the patient's family, or other witnesses.
* **Add a twist:** Perhaps there's a last-minute attempt to save Richard, or a shocking revelation about the cause of the accident.
* **Leave the reader wanting more:** End the paragraph on a cliffhanger, hinting at the wider implications of this tragedy.
