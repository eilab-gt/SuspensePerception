* **Spoiler Alert:** The last sentence reveals the tragic outcome, eliminating any potential suspense about Robert's fate.


To improve the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on a specific moment:** Instead of summarizing the entire event, zoom in on a particular moment of tension, like the wait for the new liver or the moment the doctors realize Robert is deteriorating.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital to immerse the reader in the scene.

This paragraph scores a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Action and Urgency:** The scene is dynamic, with the helicopter rotors still spinning and the men rushing against time.
* **High Stakes:** The mention of a "vital situation" and the need to "lose no time" creates a sense of urgency and importance.

This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Setting:** The paragraph describes a routine cleaning job in a hospital stairwell, which is not inherently suspenseful.
* **Lack of Conflict:** There is no sense of danger, threat, or mystery. The cleaner's workday is presented as ordinary and uneventful.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("had finished mopping," "were constantly positioned") creates a detached and unemotional tone.
* **Detailed Description:** The paragraph focuses on mundane details like the lack of windows and the placement of fire extinguishers, which does not contribute to suspense.

To make this paragraph more suspenseful, you would need to introduce:

* **A Threat:** Something unexpected or dangerous could happen in the stairwell, like a fire, a break-in, or a medical emergency.
* **A Mystery:** The cleaner could discover something unusual or unsettling, like a hidden message, a strange object, or a secret passage.
* **A Character with a Secret:** The cleaner could be hiding something or be involved in something sinister.

This paragraph scores a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if:

* **The POV was clearer:** It's not immediately clear who the narrator is or their relationship to the other characters.
* **The stakes were higher:** What are the consequences if they are caught? What is the nature of the "examples" they are carrying?
