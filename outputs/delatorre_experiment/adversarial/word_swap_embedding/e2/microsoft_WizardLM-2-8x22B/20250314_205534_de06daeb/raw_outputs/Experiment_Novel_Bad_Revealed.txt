The paragraph presents a scenario that has the potential for suspense, particularly with the mention of a life-or-death situation involving an organ transplant for a young boy. The details about the timing, the search for a suitable donor, and the urgency of the situation contribute to a sense of tension. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph is written with a detached, report-like tone and the outcome is hinted at with the mention of "par damages that the bodies continuous in transit," which suggests a negative turn of events. The suspense could be heightened with more immediate and vivid descriptions of the emotions and actions of those involved, as well as by withholding the final outcome until the end of the narrative.

This paragraph has elements that could contribute to suspense, such as the mention of a helicopter transport and a patient in a "crucial but stabilize condition." The specificity of the time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency. However, the suspense is relatively mild because the paragraph is quite brief and lacks detailed context about the situation's severity or the stakes involved. It also uses a somewhat passive and clinical tone, which can distance the reader from the emotional tension of the moment. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could include more information about Kathleen Crooked's condition, the reasons for the helicopter transport, potential risks, and the feelings of those involved.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful. It effectively sets a tense atmosphere with vivid imagery and a sense of urgency. The description of the helicopter's rotors still turning, the two individuals emerging with a critical medical case, and the mention of kidneys being transported at a precise thermal condition all contribute to a high-stakes scenario. The communication barrier due to the noise, the physical gesture to convey urgency, and the reminder that there is no time to waste all add to the suspense. The paragraph also does well to hint at the importance of the mission without fully revealing the outcome, leaving the reader curious and engaged. The dynamic action and the clear risk involved in the transport of the organs make this paragraph read as a moment of critical importance, which is key to creating suspense.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It primarily describes the routine work of a cleaner in a hospital, focusing on the mundane aspects of his job and the lack of excitement in his tasks. The detailed account of the cleaner's morning and his habits, such as whistling and not bothering with "wet floor" signs, paints a picture of normalcy and repetition rather than impending danger or tension. The mention of the cleaner finishing his work at a specific time (fifteen mn) and collecting his trolley suggests that the day is proceeding as usual without any indication of a significant event that could lead to suspense. While the setting is a hospital, which can be a place of high drama, the paragraph itself does not build suspense or hint at any unusual or critical events about to unfold.

This paragraph has moderate suspense. It introduces a setting that is complex and potentially fraught with tension, such as a hospital's secondary passageways and restricted areas like archives and courtrooms. The mention of a keycard-accessed doorway and the specificity of the east faction lift and the sixth floor suggest a place where important and possibly sensitive activities occur. The interaction between the man transporting samples and his colleague, where he advises against taking the lifts and suggests that they will meet at the destination, hints at a sense of urgency or a need for discretion. The detail that his colleagues shrug and head towards the service stairs adds a layer of intrigue, as it implies that they are accustomed to such instructions or that there is an unspoken understanding about the situation. However, the suspense is somewhat tempered by the lack of immediate danger or high stakes being clearly presented. The paragraph could be more suspenseful with more direct conflict, higher personal stakes, or a clearer sense of something going wrong.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. The description of the character's precarious situation, with his balloons causing him to lose balance on the stairs and his struggle to maintain his footing, creates a sense of immediate physical danger. The moment of crisis, where he must choose between stabilizing himself and holding onto the important case, is a classic suspenseful scenario that raises the stakes and engages the reader's concern for the outcome. The vivid imagery of the case rolling down the stairs and the analogy to "a strip du gutless essential being concussed in a bag" adds to the tension by emphasizing the potential for disaster. However, the suspense could be heightened further with more detail about the contents of the case and the consequences should it be damaged, as well as a clearer sense of the character's emotions and the implications of the incident for the broader narrative.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful. It opens with a moment of stillness after a tense incident, suggesting that the characters are assessing the situation and its potential consequences. The mention of the "b men" and the caution about possible damage to the case heightens the sense of urgency and importance of the situation. The warning to call for medics implies that there could be injuries involved, which adds to the suspense. The detailed account of one character's swift and careful navigation through the hospital complex, taking care not to slip, and the specific destination of the transplant department's visitor desk where the "medicine platoon" is waiting, all contribute to a narrative that feels high-stakes and time-sensitive. The reader is left wondering about the condition of the case's contents and the fate of the characters involved, which are effective elements of suspense.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful. It effectively conveys a sense of urgency and high stakes as the character carefully navigates the stairs while worrying about the potential damage to the precious cargo he is responsible for. The mention of an ankle injury and the character's effort to bear weight on it like a soldier with an injured comrade adds a layer of personal sacrifice and physical struggle to the scene. The reference to superstitions and the idea that the character's suffering might somehow affect the fate of the kidneys introduces an emotional and psychological dimension to the suspense. The arrival of the medical team, their rapid approach, and the direct request to clear the way all contribute to a palpable sense of tension and the importance of the moment. The reader is likely to be deeply engaged, concerned for the outcome of the delivery, and anxious about the potential complications that could arise from the character's injury and the state of the case's contents.

This paragraph is quite suspenseful. The vivid description of the doctor insisting on taking control of the handle, the case's exterior splitting open to reveal its contents, and the immediate reaction of the physicians all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The mention of a "little cluttered fridge" and the case's malfunction, with refrigerated air escaping, suggests that something valuable and temperature-sensitive, likely organs for transplant, is at risk. The physical details of the case's damage and the reaction of the medical staff, including the head shake from one of the doctors, create a sense of concern and potential disaster. The reader is left in suspense about the condition of the case's contents and the implications for the patient awaiting the transplant. The paragraph effectively builds tension and curiosity about how the situation will be resolved.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It presents a critical medical situation where precision and care are paramount. The description of the interior polyurethane rucksack, likely a cooling system for organ transportation, and the urgency of transferring the kidney to the hepatology laboratory set the stage for a high-stakes scenario. The mention of enzyme activity being sufficiently low to give hope, followed by the need for a puncture to check for malignancy, adds layers of tension and complexity to the situation. The surgeon's task of performing a biopsy with the knowledge that a mistake could irreparably harm the patient, who is a child, significantly raises the emotional stakes. The detailed account of the surgeon's actions, his jittery feelings, and the gravity of the potential outcome all contribute to a gripping sense of suspense. The reader is likely to be deeply invested in the surgeon's success and the well-being of the young patient.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It describes a delicate and critical medical procedure with a great deal of tension and attention to detail. The surgeon's careful insertion of the needle and the relief at not encountering resistance create a sense of precariousness. The description of the syringe filling with fluid and the subsequent analysis under a microscope by a colleague who is visibly affected by what he sees (blinking and pursing his lips) adds to the suspense. The mention of the glucose rate and the ominous confirmation of the organ's deterioration heighten the stakes, as the medical team awaits the diagnosis that could determine a patient's fate. The reader is likely to be fully engaged, concerned for the patient, and anxious about the outcome of the procedure, making this paragraph effectively suspenseful.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It reveals a significant and tragic event: the certification of a patient's death, Lorie Bent, due to damage sustained by the organ intended for her renal transplant. The specificity of the time (21:26) adds a sense of finality and the gravity of the situation. The mention of the harm to the organ and the inability to perform the transplant conveys the critical nature of the circumstances and the loss that has occurred. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because the paragraph presents a conclusive outcome rather than an ongoing tense situation. The reader is informed of the death after the fact, which reduces the immediate tension and emotional investment in the character's struggle for survival. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if it depicted the moments leading up to the certification of death, the efforts of the medical team to save the patient, or the emotional impact on those involved.
