The paragraph is quite suspenseful, as it sets up a scenario with high stakes—the life of a young boy hanging in the balance as he awaits a liver transplant. The mention of the critical condition of Richard Bent and the uncertainty of whether he would survive the wait creates a sense of urgency and tension. The specificity of the time (21:26) when Roberta Bent is pronounced dead adds a dramatic touch, suggesting a ticking clock scenario. However, the suspense is somewhat undercut by the fact that the outcome is revealed in the paragraph itself, with the mention of Roberta Bent's death and the failed transplant. If the paragraph had ended before revealing the outcome, it could have been rated even higher on the suspensefulness scale.

This paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. The mention of a helicopter carrying "de agencies" landing on the roof of the hospital suggests that something important or official is happening, which can pique the reader's curiosity. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the condition of Robert Bent being described as "critical but stable" adds a sense of urgency and importance to the event. However, the paragraph lacks detailed context or immediate threats that would significantly raise the stakes or create a strong sense of danger or uncertainty. It sets the stage for a potentially suspenseful scenario but does not, on its own, deliver a high level of suspense without additional context.

This paragraph is highly suspenseful. It effectively builds tension through vivid imagery and a clear sense of urgency. The description of the men descending from the helicopter with a crucial blue case, the need to communicate over the noise of the rotors, and the pointed gesture at the watch all contribute to a palpable sense of a race against time. The specific detail that the liver must be kept at four degrees centigrade adds to the stakes, implying that any delay could jeopardize the transplant. The final sentence, which underscores the critical condition of the patient and the need for haste, leaves the reader on edge, wondering if the team will successfully deliver the liver in time to save the patient's life. The paragraph ends without revealing the outcome, which is a classic technique for maintaining suspense.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine job at the hospital, focusing on the mundane aspects of his work and the environment of the service stairwell. The description is more focused on setting the scene and establishing the cleaner's daily tasks rather than building tension or hinting at an impending critical event. The mention of the "moist floor" signs could imply a potential hazard, but there is no immediate threat or sense of danger presented. The narrative is calm and methodical, which does not contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere. It lacks elements such as uncertainty, conflict, or a ticking clock that typically heighten suspense.
