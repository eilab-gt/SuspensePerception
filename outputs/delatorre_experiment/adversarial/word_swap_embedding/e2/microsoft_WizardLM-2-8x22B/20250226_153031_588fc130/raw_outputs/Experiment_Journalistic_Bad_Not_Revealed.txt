This paragraph increases the suspense by directly connecting the two men carrying the liver to the potential hazard introduced in the previous paragraph. The decision to use the service stairwell, where the floor has recently been mopped and may still be wet, raises the stakes and the reader's concern for the safety of the organ and the success of its delivery. The choice of words "decided to walk down" suggests a conscious decision that could have unforeseen consequences, which is a classic setup for suspense.

This paragraph maintains a high level of suspense by focusing on the immediate aftermath of the accident and the actions taken by the men involved. The colleague's decision to rush and warn the doctors suggests the gravity of the situation and the potential impact on the transplant procedure. Meanwhile, the other man's act of staying with the case, ensuring it is not mishandled, adds to the tension as the reader is left to imagine the possible damage to the liver and the urgency of the doctors' assessment.

The phrase "not handled in any way" until the doctors arrive implies that the condition of the liver inside the case is uncertain and that any additional movement could potentially worsen its state. The suspense is sustained by the reader's anticipation of the doctors' evaluation and the question of whether the liver is still viable for transplantation. The paragraph effectively keeps the reader on edge, concerned about the outcome and eager to learn the fate of the liver and young Robert Bent.

This paragraph contributes minimal suspense on its own. The statement "The doctor arrived promptly" is straightforward and lacks detail that would typically heighten suspense. It does provide a sense of relief that the doctor has arrived quickly to assess the situation, which could be seen as a positive development in the context of the previous paragraphs. However, without additional information about the doctor's reaction, the condition of the liver, or the implications for the transplant, the paragraph does not significantly increase the reader's tension or curiosity about the outcome.

The suspense in a narrative typically arises from uncertainty, complications, or the anticipation of a critical evaluation. Since this sentence does not elaborate on these elements, it serves more as a transition in the story rather than a suspenseful moment. The reader is likely to be more interested in what happens next once the doctor assesses the situation, rather than the mere fact that the doctor has arrived.
