7

The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene at a children's hospital, introducing a critically ill young boy named Robert Bent, and describing the anticipation of a life-saving liver transplant. The mention of a suitable donor being found but uncertainty about whether Robert would survive the wait adds tension and a sense of urgency. The use of the phrase "Cette is the story of what happened" at the end of the paragraph hints at a narrative to unfold, which can pique the reader's curiosity and heighten the suspense. However, the suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the paragraph is a setup for a story rather than being in the midst of a critical event, hence the rating of 7, indicating a good level of suspense but not reaching the highest degree.

This paragraph introduces an important event in the narrative—the arrival of the helicopter carrying the life-saving organ for Robert Bent. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of the organ's arrival being "punctual" contribute to a sense of urgency and critical timing, which are key elements of suspense. The reader is likely to be invested in the outcome of this moment, given the previous context about Robert's condition. However, the suspense is somewhat tempered because the paragraph describes an event that is positive and necessary for the story to progress, rather than presenting an immediate threat or complication. The reader is likely anticipating what happens next, particularly whether the transplant will be successful, but the suspense is more about the unfolding of events rather than a direct threat or cliffhanger. Therefore, it rates a 6 on the suspense scale, indicating a moderate level of suspense.

This paragraph significantly raises the suspense level. It provides a vivid, real-time account of the critical moments as the men carrying the liver make their way from the helicopter to the hospital. The description of the environment—the rotors still turning, the men ducking, the noise of the blades—creates an intense atmosphere. The detail that the liver is being kept at a precise temperature of four degrees centigrade in a blue case adds to the gravity of the situation, emphasizing the delicate nature of the organ transport. The inaudible cheer and the subsequent communication through gestures convey the urgency and the high stakes involved. The phrase "they had no time to lose" reinforces the time-sensitive nature of the mission, which is crucial for the patient's survival. All these elements combine to create a palpable sense of tension and imminent danger, making the reader anxious about the outcome and deeply invested in the immediate next steps. This paragraph would rate an 8 on the suspense scale, indicating a high level of suspense with the reader keenly aware of the ticking clock and the potential for something to go wrong.

This paragraph is low in suspense, particularly in comparison to the previous ones that dealt directly with the urgent liver transplant. The narrative focuses on the routine work of a cleaner in the hospital, detailing his daily tasks and his preference for cleaning the corridors over the service stairwell. The description of the cleaner's job is more about setting a scene and providing background information than building suspense. There is a hint of potential danger in the cleaner not placing "wet floor" signs as he works, which could lead to an accident, but this is a minor detail and not directly tied to any immediate threat or the critical situation of the patient, Robert Bent. The mundane nature of the cleaner's work and the lack of any direct connection to the unfolding medical drama contribute to a suspense rating of 3, indicating that the paragraph is more informative than suspenseful.

This paragraph introduces a moment of decision that could impact the urgent delivery of the liver, which adds a layer of suspense. The specific details about the layout of the hospital and the choice between using the stairs or the elevator create a sense of urgency and importance in the characters' actions. The reader is aware that time is of the essence, and any delay could have serious consequences for the patient, Robert Bent. The dialogue between the two men and the subsequent decision to use the stairs rather than wait for the elevator contribute to the tension, as it highlights the need to save every possible second. However, the suspense is somewhat muted because the paragraph describes a logistical choice rather than a direct threat or an unexpected complication. The reader is likely curious about the outcome and whether the decision to take the stairs will prove beneficial, but the suspense level is moderate rather than high. Therefore, this paragraph would rate a 5 on the suspense scale, indicating a fair amount of tension but without the heart-stopping urgency of more suspenseful scenarios.
