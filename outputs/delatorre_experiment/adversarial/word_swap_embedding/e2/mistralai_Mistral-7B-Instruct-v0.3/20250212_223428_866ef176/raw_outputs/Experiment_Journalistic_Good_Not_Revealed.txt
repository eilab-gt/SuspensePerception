 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty about the young boy's survival.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 2 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not add much suspense or tension to the story. The mention of the cleaner mopping the floor seems unrelated to the main storyline and does not contribute to the sense of urgency or importance of the liver transplant. In fact, it may even distract the reader from the main story. To make the paragraph more suspenseful, it could be rewritten to show how the cleaner's actions may have unintentionally contributed to the story. For example, "Mins earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, leaving without displaying the “wet floor” sign. Little did they know, this seemingly insignificant action would soon have life-altering consequences for the young boy, Robert Bent, who was about to undergo a critical liver transplant." This sentence would add more tension and anticipation to the story by showing how the cleaner's actions may have unintentionally put Robert Bent's life at risk.
