 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of progress and resolution, as the organ has arrived, but it does not add much suspense or tension to the story. The use of the phrase "punctually" suggests that the organ arrived on time, which may provide some relief to the reader, but it does not create a sense of urgency or danger. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the organ's journey or the challenges faced in getting it to the hospital in time.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell, but it does not create a sense of suspense or tension. The paragraph is more focused on setting the scene and providing background information about the cleaner's job, rather than building suspense for the main story.
