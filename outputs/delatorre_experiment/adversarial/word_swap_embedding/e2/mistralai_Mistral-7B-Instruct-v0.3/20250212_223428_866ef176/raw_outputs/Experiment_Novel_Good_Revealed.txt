 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The narrative sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant, the critical condition of the young boy, and the uncertainty about the donor organ's condition in transit. The suspense is further heightened by the specific time details, such as the exact hour the transplant was performed and the confirmation of the liver's functionality. However, the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. While the landing of the helicopter is an important event in the story, it does not add much suspense or tension to the narrative. The paragraph does not provide any new information about the critical condition of Robert Bent or the organ, and the use of the word "punctually" suggests that the event went as expected, which reduces the level of suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes the arrival of the organ and the urgency of the situation, which creates a sense of tension and suspense. The use of descriptive language, such as "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and "compatible liver," adds to the sense of urgency and importance of the event. The fact that the men have no time to lose and the use of the word "critical" to describe the patient's condition also increases the level of suspense. However, the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes a routine and mundane task of a hospital cleaner, and does not create any sense of tension or suspense. The paragraph does not relate to the main story of the liver transplant, and the details about the cleaner's job and his routine do not contribute to the overall suspense of the story. The paragraph is more of a distraction from the main narrative and does not add any significant tension or intrigue.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes the route the men take to reach the patient's location, which adds to the sense of urgency and tension in the story. The use of specific details, such as the location of the helipad exit, the service stairwell, and the layout of the hospital corridors, creates a clear sense of place and direction. The fact that the men choose to take the stairs instead of the lift suggests that time is of the essence, and the use of the word "urgent" in the previous paragraph sets up the expectation that the men need to act quickly. However, the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating.  ​

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes a sudden and unexpected event that creates a sense of tension and suspense. The use of descriptive language, such as "twisting his ankle" and "let go of the case," adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that the case rolls down the stairs and makes a noise that sounds like loose keys being shaken in a bag creates a sense of uncertainty and worry about the fate of the liver. The use of the word "horror" also adds to the overall suspense and tension of the scene. However, the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating.  ​

The use of descriptive language, such as "kneeling down beside it" and "looking at each other," creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The fact that the men are unsure if the liver has been damaged adds to the suspense, and the use of the word "damaged" creates a sense of danger and urgency. The fact that one of the men goes to get help while the other stays behind to watch the case also creates a sense of tension and responsibility. However, the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating.  ​  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes the waiting and anticipation of the men as they wait for the doctors to arrive, and the injured man's superstition about the liver's condition. The use of descriptive language, such as "keeping a firm hold on the bannister" and "heard them rushing up the service stairwell," creates a sense of tension and urgency. The fact that the injured man is willing to bear the pain in his ankle to help the liver adds to the sense of sacrifice and dedication of the men involved in the transplant. The use of the word "directly" also adds to the overall suspense and tension of the scene. However, the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating.  ​  ​  ​

The fact that the fridge has ruptured and is leaking refrigerated air creates a sense of uncertainty and worry about the fate of the liver.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes a critical and high-stakes situation where the fate of a child's life depends on the success of a biopsy. The use of descriptive language, such as "urgently transferred," "superficial condition," "enzyme activity," and "one millimetre out," creates a sense of tension and urgency. The fact that the surgeon is nervous and has never before performed a biopsy on a child's liver adds to the sense of danger and responsibility. The use of the word "irreparably" also adds to the overall suspense and tension of the scene. The paragraph also creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about the outcome of the biopsy, which increases the suspense. Overall, the paragraph is very suspenseful due to the high stakes and the potential for disaster if the biopsy is not successful.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph describes a critical and high-stakes situation where the fate of a child's life depends on the results of a biopsy. The use of descriptive language, such as "organising his breath," "relieved," "interminable half a minute," and "anxiously awaiting the diagnosis," creates a sense of tension and urgency. The fact that the surgeon is analyzing the sample and occasionally lifting his head to blink several times adds to the sense of anticipation and uncertainty about the outcome of the biopsy, which increases the suspense. The use of the word "optimism" also adds to the overall suspense and tension of the scene, as it suggests that the biopsy may have been successful but the outcome is not yet certain. Overall, the paragraph is very suspenseful due to the high stakes and the potential for disaster if the biopsy is not successful.  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph provides a resolution to the story, but it does not create any sense of tension or suspense. The use of specific time details, such as "21:26," adds to the sense of closure, but the paragraph does not include any unexpected twists or turns that would push it towards a higher rating. The paragraph simply confirms that the liver transplant was successful, which is not necessarily a surprising or suspenseful outcome given the high stakes and the tension built up throughout the story.  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​  ​
