 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The setting in a hospital, the critical condition of the young boy, the imminent liver transplant, and the uncertainty about the donor and the boy's survival all contribute to a sense of tension and anticipation. The use of the phrase "What you are about to read" also adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the challenges faced during the transplant or the consequences of failure.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. The landing of the helicopter carrying the organ is an important event in the story, but it does not create a significant sense of tension or anticipation on its own.

However, the paragraph does contribute to building the overall suspense of the story by setting the scene for the transplant.

However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the men's actions or the challenges they faced in transporting the organ.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the suspensefulness scale. The information about the cleaner mopping the floor does not contribute to the tension or anticipation of the transplant. In fact, it seems to be a tangential detail that does not add much to the overall story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be omitted or rewritten to provide more information about the cleaner's actions and their potential impact on the transplant.  However, the paragraph does not detract from the overall suspense of the story and could potentially be used to create a sense of foreshadowing or irony if it is revealed later that the cleaner's actions had unintended consequences for the transplant.  ​
