 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The narrative builds tension through the use of a real-life setting, a critical situation, and a looming deadline (the imminent liver transplant). The uncertainty about whether the boy, Richard Bent, will survive the wait adds to the suspense. However, the resolution of the story (the death of Robert Bent) may not be as suspenseful for some readers, as it is already known from the beginning.
