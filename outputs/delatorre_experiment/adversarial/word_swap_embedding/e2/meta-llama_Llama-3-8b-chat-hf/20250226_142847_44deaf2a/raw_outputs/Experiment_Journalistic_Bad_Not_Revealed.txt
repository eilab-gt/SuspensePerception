I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, as the medical team is waiting for a liver transplant and Robert's condition is critical. The use of phrases like "imminent liver transplant" and "awaiting the arrival of the organ" creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the transplant happen in time?" and "Will Robert survive?"

However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of surprise or unexpected twists, which are often key elements of suspenseful storytelling. The events described are relatively straightforward and predictable, and the reader is given a clear sense of what is happening and what is at stake. As a result, the paragraph is more informative and descriptive than suspenseful.
