I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The paragraph is extremely mundane and lacks any sense of tension, urgency, or excitement. The description of the cleaner's job is tedious and uneventful, and the use of phrases like "it wasn't a particularly interesting job" and "it was an agreeable job" reinforces the sense of dullness. The paragraph is more focused on providing a detailed description of the cleaner's routine than on building suspense or creating a sense of anticipation. The only thing that might be slightly suspenseful is the fact that the cleaner didn't put up the "wet floor" warning signs, but this is not developed or followed up on in any way, and the paragraph quickly moves on to the cleaner finishing their job and going about their day. Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful at all.
