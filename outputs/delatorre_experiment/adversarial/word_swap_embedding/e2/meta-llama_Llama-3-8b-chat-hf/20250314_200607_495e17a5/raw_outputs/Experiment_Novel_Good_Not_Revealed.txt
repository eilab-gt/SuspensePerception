* The introduction of the characters and the medical situation is straightforward and doesn't create a sense of tension or urgency.
* The mention of the imminent organ transplantation and the critical condition of the patient, Armando, raises some concern, but it's not enough to create a strong sense of suspense.
* The paragraph ends with a cliffhanger, "This raise the story des what occurred," which is a good attempt to create suspense, but it's not enough to overcome the lack of tension and intrigue in the rest of the paragraph.

Overall, while the paragraph does create some curiosity and interest, it doesn't have a strong sense of suspense or tension that would keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
