I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is more informative and factual, providing background information about a medical event, rather than building tension or suspense. The language used is straightforward and lacks the kind of dramatic or ominous tone that is typically associated with suspenseful writing. The only hint of tension comes from the phrase "would was nope sure if Richards would live the awaits como her circumstances es crucial", but it's not enough to create a sense of real suspense. Overall, the paragraph is more of a factual summary than a suspenseful narrative.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing a dramatic and unexpected event: a helicopter crashing onto a hospital roof.
