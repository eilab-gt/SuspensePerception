I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a "real event" and the specific hospital setting immediately pique curiosity.
* **High Stakes:**  The situation is clearly dire – a child in need of a life-saving transplant with a ticking clock.
* **Uncertainty:** The paragraph highlights the uncertainty surrounding Robert's survival and the potential complications of the wait.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the situation is serious, there isn't a palpable sense of immediate danger or a looming threat. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph relies heavily on telling the reader about the situation rather than showing it through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a ticking clock element:**  Perhaps there's a limited time window for the transplant to be successful.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Robert's condition, or the emotions of the medical team.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Subtly suggest that something might go wrong during the wait or the transplant itself.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Stakes:** The arrival of the organ adds a sense of urgency and importance to the situation.
* **Specific Time:**  The precise time (08:57) creates a sense of immediacy and anticipation.
* **Contrasting Information:** The juxtaposition of the helicopter's punctuality with Robert's critical condition creates a sense of tension.

**However:**

* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** The paragraph remains relatively detached. We don't feel Robert's fear or the medical team's anxiety.
* **Missing Details:**  We don't know what kind of organ it is, how long it takes to transport it to Robert, or what happens next.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical staff.
* **Focus on the Organ:**  Create a sense of mystery and fragility around the organ itself. Is it delicate? Is it being carefully monitored?
* **Build Anticipation:**  Hint at the challenges ahead – perhaps the surgery is complex, or there are unforeseen complications.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Visual Details:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter, heads down against the wind, creates a vivid and slightly unsettling image.
* **Importance of the Organ:** The emphasis on the liver's temperature and functionality highlights its fragility and the urgency of the situation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Correct the Errors:**  Clean up the grammar and spelling to create a more polished and immersive reading experience.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating the organ's importance, describe its appearance, the way it's handled, or the men's expressions as they carry it.

* **Hint at a Threat:**  Subtly suggest that something dangerous might be lurking in the shadows – a patient who is not what they seem, a security breach, or a hidden agenda.

I'd rate this paragraph a **8/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Cliffhanger:** The paragraph builds suspense by revealing the organ's condition just as the doctor is about to open the case.
* **Sensory Details:** The "click," the "thin stream of refrigerated air," and the description of the "split" create a vivid and unsettling image.
* **Doctor's Reaction:** The doctor's shaking head and the closing of the case immediately signal that something is wrong.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph contains a few grammatical errors ("Him" instead of "He," "either" instead of "each," "petite" instead of "small," "jefe" instead of "head," "und" instead of "and," etc.) that detract from the impact.

I'd rate this paragraph an **8/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Technical Detail:** The description of the procedure, while technical, adds a sense of realism and tension.
* **Surgeon's Anxiety:** The surgeon's nervousness is palpable, making the reader feel his pressure and the potential for disaster.

**However:**

* **Pacing:** The paragraph could benefit from a slightly slower pace to build suspense more effectively.  
* **Show, Don't Tell:** While we're told the surgeon is nervous, showing his trembling hands, his quickened breath, or his furrowed brow would create a stronger emotional impact.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Slow Down the Action:**  Consider adding a sentence or two describing the sterile environment of the lab, the hushed whispers of the medical team, or the ticking of a clock.
* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the feel of the scalpel, the smell of antiseptic, the sound of the surgeon's breathing.
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  Perhaps there's a complication during the procedure, or the surgeon makes a small mistake that could have dire consequences.
