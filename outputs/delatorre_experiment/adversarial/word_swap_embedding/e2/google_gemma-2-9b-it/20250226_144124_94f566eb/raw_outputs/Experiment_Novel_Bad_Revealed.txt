I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a real event and a life-or-death situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph sets up a clear conflict: a child in desperate need of a transplant, a donor found, but the possibility of not making it through the wait.
* **Lack of Pacing and Detail:** The paragraph feels rushed and lacks the slow build-up of tension that truly hooks a reader. We don't get a sense of Robert's condition, the emotional weight of the situation, or the medical team's struggle.
* **Confusing and Grammatical Errors:**  The numerous grammatical errors and typos ("vous," "oj," "lf," "ec") distract from the story and make it harder to invest emotionally.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his fear, his hope, his interactions with the medical team.
* **Develop the medical team's struggle:** Show their determination, their anxiety, their internal conflict.
* **Slow down the pacing:**  Expand on the moments leading up to the transplant, the anticipation, the waiting.
* **Use vivid language and sensory details:**  Bring the hospital setting to life, make the reader feel the tension in the air.
* **Proofread carefully:**  Eliminate grammatical errors to create a more polished and engaging read.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of a helicopter carrying "de agencies" immediately raises questions and suggests something significant is happening.
* **Lack of Context:** We don't know who "de agencies" are, what they're doing, or how they relate to Robert's situation. This lack of context makes it hard to understand the stakes.
* **Flat Tone:** The language is very matter-of-fact and lacks emotional weight. We don't feel the urgency or tension of the moment.
* **Unclear Connection:** The statement that Robert is "in a critical but stable condition" feels disconnected from the helicopter's arrival. It doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or impending action.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Provide more context:** Who are "de agencies"? What is their purpose? How does their arrival relate to Robert's condition?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical state, his breathing, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Use active voice and strong verbs:**  Replace "landed punctually" with something more dynamic, like "swooped down" or "touched down with a rush."
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  Hint at a time constraint, a ticking clock, or a potential threat.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Action:** The arrival of the men, the blue case, and the urgency of the situation create a sense of immediacy and importance.
* **Visual Details:** The description of the men's appearance and actions ("heads down," "hair blown," "ducking down") helps to create a vivid picture and a sense of tension.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the full story behind the "sufferers" or the nature of the "agencies," which leaves room for speculation and intrigue.
* **Pacing Issues:** The paragraph feels a bit rushed, jumping quickly from one action to the next. Slowing down the pacing and focusing on specific details could enhance the suspense.
* **Grammatical Errors:**  There are a few grammatical errors ("to helicopter," "anyone of them," "somethings") that detract from the overall impact.

**To increase the suspensefulness further, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on the emotional stakes:**  Describe the men's feelings of responsibility, their fear of failure, or their determination to succeed.
* **Build tension through sensory details:**  Describe the sound of the helicopter blades, the smell of antiseptic in the air, the feeling of urgency in the men's movements.
* **Create a sense of danger:**  Hint at potential obstacles or threats, such as a time limit, a security breach, or a medical emergency.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or uncertainty.
* **Passive Voice and Dull Language:** The writing is passive and lacks vivid imagery or engaging verbs.  Phrases like "It wasn't a particularly interesting job" and "It wasn't a dirty stairwell" further emphasize the lack of excitement.
* **Unclear Purpose:** The paragraph doesn't seem to be building towards anything. We don't know why the cleaner's routine is important or if anything unusual is about to happen.
* **Grammatical Errors:** The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors, which distract from the reading experience and make it difficult to follow.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a conflict or mystery:** Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual in the stairwell, or someone is watching him.
* **Use active voice and sensory details:**  Describe the cleaner's movements, the sounds he hears, the smells he encounters, and create a more immersive experience.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setting:** The description of the helipad exit, service stairwell, and hospital corridors creates a sense of place and atmosphere.
* **Hints of Urgency:** The mention of the "ill constitutes" on the 6th floor and the need to be quick suggests a time-sensitive situation.
* **Dialogue Adds Tension:** The conversation between the two men reveals their awareness of the urgency and their decision to take the stairs.
* **Lack of Clarity:**  We don't know the full extent of the patient's condition or the nature of the "case." This lack of information leaves room for speculation but also makes it harder to fully invest in the suspense.
* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph contains several grammatical errors ("du," "hospitalised’seconds," "nor," "reserve," "him," "extricate") that detract from the flow and clarity.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**
