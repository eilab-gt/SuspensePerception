I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous spelling and grammatical errors make the paragraph difficult to follow and detract from any potential suspense. 
* **Lack of Clear Narrative:** The events are presented in a disjointed and confusing manner. It's unclear what the central conflict or tension is.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph simply states facts without creating a sense of atmosphere or emotional engagement. We're told Robert is in a critical condition, but we don't feel the urgency or fear.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **Clearer Writing:** Correct the grammatical errors and improve sentence structure for better readability.
* **Focused Narrative:**  Establish a clear conflict and build towards a climax.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Use vivid language and sensory details to immerse the reader in the situation and evoke emotions.
