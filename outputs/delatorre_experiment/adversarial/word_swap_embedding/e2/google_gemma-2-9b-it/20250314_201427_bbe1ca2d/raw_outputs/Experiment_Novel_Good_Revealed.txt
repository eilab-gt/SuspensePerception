I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Jumbled and Unclear:** The paragraph is poorly written with grammatical errors and unclear sentence structure. This makes it difficult to follow the story and creates confusion rather than suspense.
* **Lack of Tension:**  While the situation involves a critical kidney transplant, the paragraph doesn't build any real tension or anticipation. We're told Roberto's situation is critical, but there's no sense of urgency or danger.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the events rather than showing us. We're told Roberto's transplant was successful, but we don't experience the emotional rollercoaster of the surgery or the relief of its outcome.


To make this paragraph more suspenseful, the writer could:

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds, the smells, the emotions of the people involved.
* **Create a Pacing:**  Use shorter sentences and build towards a climax. 
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Roberto's condition, describe his physical state, his breathing, his reactions.
* **Introduce Conflict:**  Add an unexpected obstacle or complication to the transplant process.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("de," "agencies," "nova") distract from the potential suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.

**How to improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the Grammar:**  Correct the grammatical errors to make the writing clear and engaging.
* **Provide Context:**  Who is Robert Misshapen? What happened to him? Why are agencies transporting him?
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating his condition, describe his appearance, his breathing, the reactions of those around him.
* **Build Tension:**  Use sensory details and pacing to create a sense of urgency and anticipation. For example, describe the whirring of the helicopter blades, the worried faces of the medical staff, the tense silence as they prepare to receive Robert.
