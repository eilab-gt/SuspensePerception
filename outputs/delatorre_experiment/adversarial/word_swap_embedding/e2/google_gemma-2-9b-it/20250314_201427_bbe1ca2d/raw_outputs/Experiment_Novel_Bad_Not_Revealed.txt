I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors make the paragraph difficult to read and understand. This disrupts the flow and prevents the reader from getting fully immersed in the story.
* **Lack of Detail:**  While the paragraph sets up a scenario with a potential life-or-death situation, it lacks specific details that would create suspense. We don't know anything about Marcelo's condition, the severity of his illness, or the challenges the medical team faces.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us that the situation is "pivotal" and that the team is "not persuaded" Armando will survive, but it doesn't show us these things through vivid descriptions or dialogue.

To increase the suspense, the author could:

* **Correct the grammatical errors:** This will make the writing clearer and more engaging.
* **Provide more specific details:** Describe Marcelo's illness, the urgency of the situation, and the emotions of the medical team.
* **Use sensory details:**  Appeal to the reader's senses by describing the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital environment.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** Use strong verbs and short sentences to convey the feeling of time running out.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:**  Like the previous paragraph, the grammatical errors make it hard to follow and detract from the potential suspense.
* **Vague Details:** We know a helicopter landed, and Patricia Bent is in a "pivotal but stable" condition, but we don't know *why* the helicopter is there or what "pivotal" means in this context. This lack of clarity prevents the reader from fully engaging with the situation.
* **Missing Emotional Hook:**  The paragraph lacks any emotional connection. We don't feel Patricia's fear, the urgency of the situation, or the tension surrounding her condition.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Correct the grammar:**  This will make the writing clearer and more impactful.
* **Provide context:**  Who is Patricia Bent? What is her condition? Why is the helicopter so important?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying she's in a "pivotal" situation, describe the scene in a way that conveys the gravity of her condition.
