I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors distract the reader and make it difficult to fully engage with the story. 
* **Lack of Vivid Description:** The writing is very bland and lacks sensory details that could create a sense of tension or urgency. We don't get a strong sense of Robert's condition or the atmosphere in the hospital.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us that Robert's situation is critical and that there's a race against time, but it doesn't show us through action or dialogue.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Be grammatically corrected:**  This would make the writing clearer and more engaging.
* **Use more vivid language:**  Describe Robert's pain, the sterile environment of the hospital, the anxious faces of the medical team.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying Robert's situation is critical, describe his labored breathing, his pale skin, or the frantic activity of the doctors.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Introduce a small detail that suggests something might go wrong with the transplant.
