I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical and spelling errors distract the reader and make it difficult to fully engage with the story. 
* **Lack of Clear Stakes:** While we understand Robert is in a critical condition, the paragraph doesn't clearly establish what the potential consequences are if he doesn't survive the transplant. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's condition is critical and the doctors are unsure if he will survive, but it doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The paragraph ends abruptly with "Ec resides the storytelling du quoi happened," which is confusing and doesn't create a sense of anticipation for what's to come.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* Be edited for grammar and clarity.
* Focus on specific details that create a sense of urgency and danger.
* Use sensory language to immerse the reader in the situation.
* End with a cliffhanger or a question that leaves the reader wanting more.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors ("dismounted promptly pertaining," "des nova hospitals," "latter indispensable") which make it difficult to follow and detract from any potential suspense.

* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the choppers carrying the organ dismounted") makes the action feel distant and less impactful.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**
