 I would rate the paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively sets the scene for a high-stakes medical situation, with the fate of an eight-year-old boy hanging in the balance as the medical team waits for a liver transplant. The use of phrases such as "critical situation" and "if Robert would survive the wait" adds to the tension and suspense. The only reason I didn't give it a 9 is because the paragraph is primarily focused on setting the scene and introducing the situation, rather than building up to a specific climactic moment. However, it does a great job of making the reader curious about what will happen next.
