 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension and anticipation with the mention of the helicopter carrying the organ landing on the hospital roof, it is relatively short and does not provide much context or background information. As a result, it may not be as effective at drawing the reader in and holding their attention as a longer, more detailed paragraph might be.

  I would rate the paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph adds to the tension and anticipation established in the previous paragraph by describing the arrival of the organ-carrying case. The use of specific details, such as the shape and color of the case, helps to create a sense of realism and urgency. The fact that the case is being carried by two men also adds to the sense of importance and significance. Overall, the paragraph does a good job of building on the suspense established in the previous paragraph and making the reader want to know more about what is happening.
