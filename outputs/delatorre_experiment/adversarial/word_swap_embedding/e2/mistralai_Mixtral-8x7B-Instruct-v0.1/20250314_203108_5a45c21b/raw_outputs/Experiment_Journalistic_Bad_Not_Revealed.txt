 I would rate this paragraph a 5 for suspensefulness. While it does set up a tense situation with the young boy, Dagmar Twisted, waiting for a kidney transplant, the writing style is somewhat difficult to follow and distracts from the suspense. Additionally, the paragraph gives away too much information at the beginning, which reduces the element of surprise and anticipation. To increase the suspense, it would be more effective to reveal the critical situation and the need for a donor gradually, keeping the reader in suspense about the outcome.

 I would rate this paragraph a 1 for suspensefulness. While it does provide some context about the setting, it does not introduce any tension or uncertainty about the outcome.
