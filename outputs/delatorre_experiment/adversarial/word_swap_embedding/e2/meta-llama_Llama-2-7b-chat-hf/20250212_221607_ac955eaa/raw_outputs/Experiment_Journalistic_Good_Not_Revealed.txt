  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a clear and compelling situation, with a young boy named Robert who is in critical condition and waiting for a liver transplant. The fact that a suitable donor has been found adds to the tension, as does the uncertainty of whether Robert will survive the wait. The use of phrases like "just the day before" and "not sure if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the outcome of the story.

However, the paragraph does not provide any concrete details or clues about what will happen next, which keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert and whether he will receive the transplant, but the paragraph does not provide any concrete hints or red herrings to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
