  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a clear and compelling situation, with a young boy named Robert who is in critical condition and waiting for a liver transplant. The fact that a suitable donor has been found adds to the tension, as does the uncertainty of whether Robert will survive the wait. The use of phrases like "just the day before" and "not sure if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the outcome of the story.

However, the paragraph does not provide any concrete details or clues about what will happen next, which keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert and whether he will receive the transplant, but the paragraph does not provide any concrete hints or red herrings to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the lack of excitement in his job, which creates a sense of monotony and predictability. The use of phrases like "not particularly interesting job," "agreeable job," and "like every morning" reinforces this sense of routine and lack of suspense. The paragraph also provides some mundane details about the cleaner's work, such as the location of the fire extinguishers and the fact that the service stairwell is not dirty, which further reduces the sense of tension or suspense.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness is the mention of the cleaner whistling as he works, which could potentially be a red herring or a sign of something unexpected happening later in the story. However, this detail is not developed further in the paragraph, so it does not add much to the overall suspense level.

The fact that the man carrying the case is hesitant to take the lift adds to the suspense, as it suggests that something could go wrong.

  I would rate this paragraph as an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a dangerous and high-stakes situation, with the man struggling to maintain his balance and avoid falling down the stairs while holding onto the bannister. The use of sensory details like "twisting his ankle" and "a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag" creates a vivid and intense atmosphere, raising questions about the outcome of the situation. The fact that the case rolls down the stairs and out of the man's reach adds to the suspense, as it suggests that something valuable and important may be lost.
