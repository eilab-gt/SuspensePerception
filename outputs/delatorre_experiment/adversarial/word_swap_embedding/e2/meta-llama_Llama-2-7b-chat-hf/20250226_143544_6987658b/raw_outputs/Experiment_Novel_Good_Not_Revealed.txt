  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

2. The use of specific details, such as the date and time of the event, and the name of the hospital, adds to the sense of realism and makes the situation feel more immediate and intense.
3. The mention of the medical team's uncertainty about the boy's survival adds to the suspense, as it creates a sense of unpredictability and raises the stakes.
4. However, the paragraph does not provide any concrete information about what will happen next, which keeps the reader in suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph provides some important details, it is not overly suspenseful because it does not offer any major twists or surprises. The suspense is more subtle and builds gradually, which may make it more effective in keeping the reader engaged.
