I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a dramatic and intense situation, with a young boy named Robert Twisted waiting for a liver transplant at a hospital. The use of specific details, such as the date and time, adds to the sense of realism and raises the stakes. The phrase "his conditions was essential" implies that Robert's life is in danger, which creates tension.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is hindered by several factors. The writing is marred by numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which can be distracting and make it difficult to follow the story. Additionally, the paragraph's structure and pacing are somewhat disjointed, which can disrupt the flow of tension.

The biggest issue, though, is that the paragraph ultimately resolves the suspense by revealing that Robert dies. While this is a tragic and dramatic event, it can actually reduce the suspensefulness of the paragraph, as the reader is no longer left wondering what will happen to Robert. A more suspenseful approach might be to end the paragraph on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering if Robert will survive or not.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph sets up a sense of urgency and importance with the mention of a helicopter transport and a patient, Kathleen Crooked, in a crucial but stable condition. The use of a specific time, 08:57, adds to the sense of realism and creates a sense of immediacy.

However, the paragraph is quite short and lacks any real sense of tension or conflict. The phrase "crucial but stable condition" suggests that Kathleen is in a serious situation, but the word "stable" implies that she is not in immediate danger. The paragraph also lacks any sense of uncertainty or unpredictability, which is essential for creating suspense.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements that could contribute to suspense, it is too brief and lacks the necessary tension and uncertainty to be truly suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is much more suspenseful than the previous two because it creates a sense of urgency and tension through the use of vivid and intense descriptions. The image of the two people emerging from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown back by the rotor wash, sets a dramatic tone. The fact that one of them is clutching a case containing kidneys that need to be transplanted within a certain time frame (four degrees percentage) raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.

The use of sensory details, such as the noise of the blades and the need for the character to shout to be heard, immerses the reader in the scene and makes them feel like they are experiencing it firsthand. The fact that the character has to physically impact his colleague to get his attention adds to the sense of intensity and urgency.

The paragraph also creates suspense through the use of uncertainty and unpredictability. The reader is not sure what will happen next or if the characters will be able to successfully transport the kidneys. The phrase "during a indispensable situation f sont had nope time des lose" suggests that the characters are in a desperate and critical situation, which adds to the sense of tension and suspense.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this paragraph a 9 out of 9 is that it is still a bit hard to follow due to some grammatical and spelling errors. However, the suspenseful elements of the paragraph are strong enough to overcome these issues and keep the reader engaged.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph is quite the opposite of the previous one in terms of suspensefulness. The description of the janitor's daily routine is mundane and lacks any sense of tension or urgency. The use of phrases like "didn't a particularly interesting workday", "enjoyable job", and "typical working daytime" creates a sense of normalcy and routine, which is not conducive to suspense.

The paragraph is also quite long and meandering, with a lot of extraneous details about the janitor's cleaning routine and the layout of the hospital. While these details might be useful for setting the scene, they don't contribute to any sense of suspense or tension.

The only potential element of suspense is the fact that the janitor doesn't bother to put up "wet floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident. However, this is not developed or emphasized in any way, and the paragraph ends with the janitor simply going about his routine as usual.

Overall, this paragraph is more of a descriptive passage than a suspenseful one, and it doesn't do much to engage the reader or create a sense of tension.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

This paragraph creates a sense of suspense through the use of descriptive language and the introduction of a mysterious character with unclear intentions. The description of the metal ramp and the service stairs creates a sense of confinement and isolation, which adds to the tension.

The introduction of the character transporting examples and the woman's reaction to him ("the alia caught herself weaponry") suggests that something is not quite right, and that there may be a threat or danger lurking. The man's advice to avoid the lifts and take the stairs instead adds to the sense of unease, as it implies that something might be wrong with the lifts.

The use of phrases like "for the moment vi obtain there and waits at it to arrived" and "him'cl has get anymore than marching down two storey" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind. What is the man trying to avoid? What is going to happen on the 6th floor?

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by the fact that the characters' motivations and goals are not entirely clear. The woman's companions seem to shrug off the man's warning and leave, which reduces the sense of tension and urgency. Additionally, the paragraph's language and grammar are sometimes unclear, which can make it difficult to follow and reduce the sense of suspense.

Overall, while this paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could be improved with clearer language and a more defined sense of danger or threat.
