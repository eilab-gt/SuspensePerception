I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and uncertainty by introducing a critical medical procedure (renal transplant) and a patient's life hanging in the balance.
* The use of phrases like "imminent renal transplanted" and "circumstances es crucial" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind.
* The introduction of a potential donor and the uncertainty surrounding the patient's survival adds to the tension.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by:

* The awkward and unclear writing style, which can make it difficult for the reader to fully engage with the story.
* The lack of emotional connection with the patient, Robert Bent, who is introduced somewhat abruptly and without much context.
* The somewhat clichéd setup of a medical drama, which may not be particularly original or surprising.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could be improved with clearer writing, more character development, and a more unique or surprising plot twist.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of sudden and dramatic action with the helicopter crash, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The use of specific details like the time "08:57" adds a sense of realism and immediacy to the scene.
* The mention of a character, Kathleen Deformed, in a "critical although stable situation" raises questions about her fate and creates some concern for her well-being.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by:

* The unclear and awkward writing style, which can make it difficult to fully understand what's happening.
* The lack of context about Kathleen's situation and why she's in the hospital, which makes it hard to invest in her fate.
* The somewhat absurd and unrealistic scenario of a helicopter crashing onto a hospital roof, which may strain credibility and reduce tension.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of surprise and action, it could be improved with clearer writing, more context, and a more believable and suspenseful scenario.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph is quite confusing and unclear, which makes it difficult to understand what's happening and invest in the story.
* The use of awkward phrasing and made-up words ("même minor blu fridge", "du shape of another case") creates a sense of disorientation and distraction.
* The mention of a liver being stored in a case is somewhat intriguing, but it's not clear what this has to do with the helicopter crash or Kathleen's situation, which reduces the sense of tension or suspense.

Overall, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by its unclear and confusing writing style, which makes it hard to follow and invest in the story. To create more suspense, the paragraph would need to be rewritten for clarity and coherence, and would need to establish a clearer connection to the larger story and its stakes.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph is extremely mundane and focuses on a routine, everyday activity (a cleaner mopping the floor).
* There is no sense of danger, tension, or uncertainty in the paragraph.
* The only potential source of suspense is the fact that the cleaner didn't leave a "wetted floor" sign, but this is a relatively minor issue and doesn't create a sense of urgency or stakes.
* The paragraph doesn't seem to be connected to the previous paragraphs or any larger story, which makes it feel isolated and unimportant.

Overall, the paragraph is very low on suspense and doesn't create any sense of tension or anticipation. It's a very ordinary and uneventful scene that doesn't contribute to a sense of suspense or drama.

I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of potential danger or mistake, as the two men transporting the liver seem to be taking a wrong turn or making an error.
* The use of the phrase "forgot de ceilings" is unclear, but it could suggest that they're not paying attention or are careless, which adds to the sense of potential danger.
* The fact that they're transporting a liver, which is a critical and time-sensitive organ, adds to the sense of urgency and importance.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by:

* The unclear and awkward writing style, which makes it difficult to fully understand what's happening.
* The lack of context about the consequences of their mistake, which makes it hard to gauge the level of danger or tension.
* The somewhat mundane setting of a servicing stairway, which doesn't inherently create a sense of suspense or drama.

Overall, the paragraph has some elements of potential danger and mistake, but it could be improved with clearer writing, more context, and a more dramatic or intense setting.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of sudden and intense danger, as the person carrying the case (containing a liver) slips and drops it, causing it to plummet downwards.
* The use of words like "plummeted" and "downwards" creates a sense of rapid and uncontrolled movement, which adds to the sense of tension and urgency.
* The fact that the case contains a liver, which is a critical and time-sensitive organ, adds to the sense of importance and raises the stakes.
* The paragraph creates a sense of sudden and unexpected event, which grabs the reader's attention and makes them wonder what will happen next.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the writing style is still a bit awkward and unclear, which can make it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the scene. However, the paragraph does a good job of creating a sense of sudden danger and tension, which makes it quite suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of relief and tension release, as the person who dropped the case regains their footing and stays to supervise the case, ensuring it's not handled until the medics arrive.
* The use of words like "promptly" and "cautionary" suggests a sense of urgency and importance, which adds to the sense of tension.
* The fact that the medics are being called and are on their way creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen next.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by:

* The somewhat anticlimactic nature of the scene, as the immediate danger has passed and the situation seems to be under control.
* The lack of sense of urgency or time pressure, as the medics are on their way but it's not clear how long it will take them to arrive.
* The somewhat mundane and procedural nature of the scene, as the person is simply waiting for the medics to arrive, which doesn't create a sense of high-stakes drama or tension.

Overall, the paragraph has some elements of tension and anticipation, but it's not as suspenseful as the previous paragraph, which had a more sudden and intense moment of danger.

Here's why:

* The use of words like "ruptured" implies a sense of sudden and catastrophic failure, which adds to the sense of shock and tension.
* The fact that the liver is a critical and time-sensitive organ adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the situation feel more dire and suspenseful.
* The paragraph creates a sense of sudden and unexpected twist, which grabs the reader's attention and makes them wonder what will happen next.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the writing style is still a bit awkward and unclear, which can make it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the scene. However, the paragraph does a good job of creating a sense of sudden shock and tension, which makes it quite suspenseful.
