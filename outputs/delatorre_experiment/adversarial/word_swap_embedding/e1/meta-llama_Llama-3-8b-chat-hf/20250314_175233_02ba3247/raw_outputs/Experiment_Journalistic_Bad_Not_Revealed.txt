I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and providing context, which is informative but not particularly suspenseful.
* The introduction of Dagmar, the 8-year-old boy, and the fact that he's about to undergo a kidney transplant creates some tension, but it's not particularly surprising or unexpected.
* The mention of the donor and the uncertainty about Robert's survival adds some suspense, but it's not fully developed or built up to create a sense of urgency or danger.
* The final sentence, "It is du story de whereof happened," is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't provide much resolution or payoff, which might leave the reader feeling a bit unsatisfied.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it's not particularly well-developed or effective in creating a sense of tension or uncertainty.
