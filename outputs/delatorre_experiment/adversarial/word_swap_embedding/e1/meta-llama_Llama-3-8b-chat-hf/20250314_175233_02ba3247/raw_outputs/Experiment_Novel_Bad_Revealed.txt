I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting the scene and establishing the stakes, which is a good way to build tension. The reader is immediately aware that something serious is happening at the hospital.
* The use of specific details, such as the date and time, adds to the sense of realism and makes the story feel more immediate.
* The introduction of the patient, Robert, and the fact that he's waiting for a liver transplant creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind (e.g., will he receive the transplant in time?).
* The use of phrases like "only a day previously" and "finally, under 21:26" creates a sense of anticipation and builds tension as the reader waits to find out what happens next.
* The sudden and unexpected twist at the end, where Robert dies due to damage to the transplanted liver, is a good surprise and adds to the suspense.

However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it:

* Built up the tension more gradually, rather than revealing the outcome so quickly.
* Added more sensory details to help the reader feel like they're experiencing the events alongside the characters.
* Created more emotional investment in Robert's story by providing more background information or character development.
* Used more active and descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively conveys the sense of urgency and danger, but it could be even more effective with a few tweaks.
