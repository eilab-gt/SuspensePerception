I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is written in a formal and technical tone, which makes it difficult to create a sense of tension or suspense. The language is also quite dry and lacks vivid descriptions or emotional appeals that could draw the reader in. The story itself is also quite straightforward and lacks any real surprises or twists, which makes it hard to build suspense. The only slightly suspenseful moment is the mention of Roberto's critical situation, but it's not enough to create a sense of urgency or tension. Overall, the paragraph is more informative and factual than suspenseful.
