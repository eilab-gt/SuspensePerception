I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Unclear Narrative:** The paragraph is grammatically jumbled and difficult to understand. This lack of clarity makes it hard to grasp the situation and invest in the potential suspense.
* **Missing Stakes:** While we understand there's a transplant and some uncertainty, we don't know *why* Richards' circumstances are crucial. What are the potential consequences if the transplant fails?  Without clear stakes, there's little to make the reader anxious.
* **Passive Voice:** The heavy use of passive voice ("was constituted," "were all ready," "would was") makes the writing feel distant and unemotional.  Active voice would create a stronger sense of immediacy and tension.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph needs:

* **Clarity:**  Correct the grammar and punctuation to make the story easy to follow.
* **Defined Stakes:**  Explain the potential dangers if the transplant doesn't succeed. What will happen to Richards?
* **Active Voice:**  Use active voice to create a sense of urgency and action.
* **Intriguing Details:**  Add sensory details or hints about the characters' emotions to draw the reader in.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The image of a helicopter crashing onto a hospital roof immediately grabs attention and suggests something dramatic has happened.
* **Unclear Details:**  We don't know who "du body" belongs to, or why they were being transported by helicopter. This lack of information creates some curiosity and a desire to know more.
* **Vague Language:** Phrases like "tumbled punctually" and "critical although stable situation" are a bit awkward and don't create a strong sense of tension.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Reveal More:**  Give us a hint about the identity of the person in the helicopter and the reason for their transport.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying Kathleen is in a "critical although stable situation," describe her condition in more vivid detail.
* **Heighten the Stakes:**  Suggest the potential consequences of the crash or Kathleen's condition.


By adding more specific details and emotional weight, the paragraph could become much more suspenseful.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The idea of a helicopter carrying a liver for transplant immediately raises questions and suggests a high-stakes situation.
* **Confusing Language:** The grammar and word choices are very awkward ("carriage même minor blu fridge," "in du shape of another case"), making it difficult to understand the scene clearly.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't know anything about the people involved or their motivations, so it's hard to feel invested in their fate.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Clarify the Language:**  Rewrite the sentences using clear and concise language.
* **Introduce Characters:**  Give us names and brief descriptions of the two men, perhaps hinting at their relationship to the liver transplant.
* **Build Tension:**  Add details that suggest the urgency of the situation. Is there a time limit for the transplant? Are there any obstacles in their way?



By making the language more accessible and adding emotional depth, the paragraph could become more engaging and suspenseful.

Here's why:

* **Unclear Stakes:**  We don't know why the "wet floor" sign is important. What are the potential consequences of someone slipping? 
* **Passive Voice:** The passive voice ("was finishing," "leave without showing") makes the writing feel distant and unemotional.
* **Lack of Context:** We have no idea where this is happening or who the cleaner is. This lack of context makes it hard to invest in the potential danger.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Establish Stakes:**  Explain why the wet floor is a problem. Is someone about to enter the stairwell? Is there a time pressure?
* **Use Active Voice:**  Rewrite the sentences using active voice to create a sense of immediacy.
* **Add Sensory Details:**  Describe the sound of dripping water, the smell of cleaning solution, or the slickness of the floor to create a more vivid and unsettling image.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale.

* **Lack of Detail:** The sentence is incredibly brief and tells us very little. We don't know who the medical team is, what they look like, or how they react to the situation.
* **No Tension:** There's no sense of urgency or danger. The arrival of the medical team, while important, doesn't create any immediate suspense.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Action-Driven:** The paragraph moves the story forward with the doctors taking the case to the lab and the surgeon performing a biopsy. This creates a sense of momentum.
* **Medical Mystery:** The mention of a biopsy and studying the "condition of the bodies" suggests a medical mystery that needs to be solved.

**However, it lacks some key elements for higher suspense:**

* **Vague Details:** We don't know what's wrong with the liver, why the biopsy is necessary, or what the potential outcomes could be.
* **Passive Voice:**  Phrases like "carried outward una biopsy" are awkward and make the writing feel distant.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't know anything about the patients or the doctors, so it's hard to feel invested in their fate.

* **Specific Time:** The mention of the exact time (21:26) adds a sense of urgency and finality to the moment.
