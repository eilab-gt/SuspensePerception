I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness.

* **High Stakes:** The paragraph clearly establishes the high stakes – the boy's life hangs in the balance.

* **Confusing Details:**  The paragraph contains some confusing details (e.g., "Cynthia Bent" and "her situation") that detract from the flow and create a sense of disorientation.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Highlight the ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time they have before it's too late.
