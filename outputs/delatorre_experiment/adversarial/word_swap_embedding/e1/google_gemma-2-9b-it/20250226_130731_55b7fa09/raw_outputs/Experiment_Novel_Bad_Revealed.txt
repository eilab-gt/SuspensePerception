I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The opening line about a real event and a life-or-death situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph sets up a clear conflict: a child in desperate need of a transplant, a donor found, but the possibility of not making it through the wait.
* **Lack of Pacing and Detail:** The paragraph feels rushed and lacks the slow build-up of tension that truly captivates a reader. We don't get a sense of Robert's condition, the emotional weight of the situation, or the medical team's struggle.
* **Confusing and Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors and typos ("vous," "oj," "lf," "ec") detract from the overall impact and make it harder to focus on the story.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** Describe his fear, his hope, his interactions with the medical team.
* **Develop the medical team's emotions:** Show their dedication, their anxiety, their struggle to save Robert.
* **Slow down the pacing:**  Expand on the wait for the organ, the anticipation, the moments of doubt.
* **Use vivid language and sensory details:**  Bring the hospital setting to life, make the reader feel the tension in the air.
* **Correct the grammatical errors:**  Ensure the writing is clear and engaging.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The arrival of a helicopter carrying "agencies" immediately raises questions and suggests something significant is happening.
* **Lack of Context:** We don't know who "de agencies" are, what they're doing, or how they relate to Robert's situation. This lack of context makes it hard to feel invested in the outcome.
* **Flat Tone:** The language is very matter-of-fact and lacks any sense of urgency or drama. 
* **Unclear Stakes:** While we know Robert is in critical condition, the paragraph doesn't make it clear what the helicopter's arrival means for him. Is it good news or bad news?

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* **Provide more context:** Who are "de agencies"? What is their purpose?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical state, his breathing, the worried faces of the medical staff.
* **Use stronger verbs and more evocative language:**  Replace "landed punctually" with something more active and suspenseful, like "swooped down" or "touched down with a jarring thud."
* **Hint at the potential consequences:**  Suggest that the helicopter's arrival could change Robert's fate for better or worse.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Action:** The arrival of the men, the blue case, and the urgency of the situation create a sense of immediacy and importance.
* **Visual Details:** The description of the men's appearance and actions ("heads down," "hair blown," "ducking down") helps to create a vivid picture and adds to the tension.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know the full story behind the "agencies" or the exact nature of Robert's condition, which leaves room for speculation and keeps the reader guessing.
* **Pacing Issues:** The paragraph feels a bit rushed, particularly the ending. Slowing down the pace and focusing on the emotional weight of the situation could increase the suspense.
* **Grammatical Errors:**  There are a few grammatical errors ("to helicopter," "anyone of them," "somethings," "per noise," "z the helicopters") that detract from the overall impact.

**To further enhance the suspensefulness:**

* **Focus on the men's emotions:** Are they nervous? Determined?  Show their internal struggle as they race against time.
* **Build anticipation:**  Describe the sounds and sights of the hospital, the anticipation of the medical team, the ticking clock.
* **Create a sense of danger:**  Hint at potential obstacles or complications that could jeopardize the transplant.
* **Refine the language:**  Correct the grammatical errors and use more precise and evocative language.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict:** The paragraph describes a mundane, uneventful task. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or urgency.
* **Flat Tone:** The writing is very matter-of-fact and lacks any emotional engagement.
* **Unclear Purpose:** It's unclear why this seemingly irrelevant information about a cleaner is included. It doesn't seem to connect to any larger narrative or build towards a climax.
* **Grammatical Errors:** The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors, which further detract from its readability and impact.

**To make this paragraph suspenseful, it would need a complete overhaul:**

* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual in the stairwell, or someone is following him.
* **Create a sense of mystery:**  Hint at a hidden secret or a dangerous situation lurking beneath the surface.
* **Develop the cleaner's character:** Give him a backstory, motivations, or fears that make him more relatable and invested in the outcome.
