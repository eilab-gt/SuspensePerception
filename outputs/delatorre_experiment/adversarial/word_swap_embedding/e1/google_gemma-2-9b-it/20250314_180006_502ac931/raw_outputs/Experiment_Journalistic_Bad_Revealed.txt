I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical and spelling errors distract the reader and make it difficult to fully engage with the story. 
* **Lack of Clear Stakes:** While we understand Robert is in a critical condition, the paragraph doesn't clearly establish what the potential consequences are if he doesn't survive the transplant. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Robert's condition is critical and the doctors are unsure if he will survive, but it doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or dialogue.
* **Abrupt Ending:** The paragraph ends abruptly with "Ec resides the storytelling du quoi happened," which is confusing and doesn't create a sense of anticipation for what's to come.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* Be edited for grammar and clarity.
* Focus on specific details that create a sense of urgency and danger.
* Use sensory language to immerse the reader in the situation.
* End with a cliffhanger or a question that leaves the reader wanting more.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors ("dismounted promptly pertaining," "des nova hospitals," "latter indispensable") which make it difficult to follow and detract from any potential suspense.
* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't feel any connection to Robert or the situation. The language is very clinical and detached.
* **Unclear Stakes:** While we know an organ is being transported, the paragraph doesn't make it clear why this is so crucial or what the consequences are if it's not successful.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the choppers carrying the organ dismounted") makes the action feel distant and less impactful.

**To increase the suspensefulness, the paragraph could:**

* Be thoroughly edited for grammar and clarity.
* Use more active and engaging language.
* Focus on sensory details to create a sense of urgency and tension.
* Hint at the potential consequences of the organ not arriving in time.
*  Give us a glimpse into Robert's emotional state or the feelings of those involved.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

**However, it still lacks:**

* **Strong Stakes:** We don't know what's inside the case or why it's so important. 
* **Emotional Connection:** We don't feel anything for the man or care about the outcome.
* **Sensory Details:** The description is very basic and lacks vivid imagery.

* **Reveal the contents of the case:** Is it a medical device? A piece of evidence? A valuable artifact?
* **Describe the man's reaction:** Is he panicked? Determined to catch it?
* **Use sensory details:**  Describe the sound of the case hitting the stairs, the man's racing heartbeat, the smell of fear.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Detail:** The sentence is incredibly short and vague. We don't know who the medical team is, what they're arriving for, or how they arrive.

* **Show their urgency:**  Use words like "dashed," "hurried," or "frantic" to convey a sense of speed and importance.
