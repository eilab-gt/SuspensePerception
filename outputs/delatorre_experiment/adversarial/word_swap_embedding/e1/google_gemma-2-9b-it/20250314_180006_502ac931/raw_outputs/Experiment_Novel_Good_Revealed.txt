I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Jumbled and Unclear:** The paragraph is poorly written with grammatical errors and unclear sentence structure. This makes it difficult to follow the story and creates confusion rather than suspense.
* **Lack of Tension:**  While the situation involves a critical kidney transplant, the paragraph doesn't build any real tension or anticipation. We're told Roberto's situation is critical, but there's no sense of urgency or danger.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us about the events rather than showing us. We're told Roberto's transplant was successful, but we don't experience the emotional rollercoaster of the surgery or the relief of its outcome.


To make this paragraph more suspenseful, the writer could:

* **Focus on Sensory Details:** Describe the hospital environment, the sounds, the smells, the emotions of the people involved.
* **Create a Pacing:**  Use shorter sentences and build towards a climax. 
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Roberto's condition, describe his physical state, his breathing, his reactions.
* **Introduce Conflict:**  Add an unexpected obstacle or complication to the transplant process.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors ("de," "agencies," "nova") distract from the potential suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Vague Details:** We don't know who the "agencies" are or what their purpose is. This lack of clarity hinders our ability to invest in the situation.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** We're told Robert is in a "critical although steady condition," but we don't get a sense of his actual state or the urgency of the situation.

**How to improve the suspense:**

* **Fix the Grammar:**  Correct the grammatical errors to make the writing clear and engaging.
* **Specify the Agencies:**  Identify the agencies involved (e.g., medical team, rescue squad) to give the reader context.
* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his appearance, his breathing, or the actions of those around him to convey the gravity of the situation.
* **Add Sensory Details:**  Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the sights of the landing, the atmosphere of the hospital to create a more immersive experience.

I'd rate this paragraph a **1** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the mundane details of a cleaning job. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or conflict.
* **Passive Voice:** The heavy use of passive voice ("the floor was mopped," "the walls were dull") makes the writing feel flat and uneventful.
* **Lack of Character Development:** We learn nothing about the cleaner's personality, motivations, or fears. This makes it difficult to connect with them or care about their situation.
* **No Plot Movement:**  The paragraph simply describes the routine of the cleaning job. There's no sense of a story unfolding or a goal to be achieved.

**To make this paragraph more suspenseful, the writer could:**

* **Introduce a Disruption:**  Something unexpected could happen during the cleaning routine, like finding a hidden object, encountering a strange person, or hearing a disturbing noise.
* **Create a Sense of Unease:**  The setting could be described in a way that creates a feeling of claustrophobia or dread.

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The numerous grammatical errors ("xi became latest door," "nova mec bears the case went for seep") detract from the overall impact and make it harder to follow the story.
