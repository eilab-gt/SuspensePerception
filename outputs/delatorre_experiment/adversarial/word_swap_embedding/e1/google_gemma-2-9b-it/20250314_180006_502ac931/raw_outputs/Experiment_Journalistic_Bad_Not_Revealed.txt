I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors and unusual phrasing make it difficult to follow the story and create a sense of immersion. This detracts from the suspense.
* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While the paragraph mentions a critical situation and a boy awaiting a kidney transplant, it doesn't establish a clear and present danger. We don't know what specifically threatens Dagmar's survival.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us Dagmar's situation is critical but doesn't show us through vivid descriptions or actions that create tension.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Be grammatically corrected:**  Clear and concise language will help the reader focus on the story.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe the hospital environment, Dagmar's physical state, or the emotions of those involved to create a more immersive experience.
* **Hint at a specific threat:**  Is there a complication with the transplant? Is there a time limit?  Adding a concrete danger will raise the stakes.
* **Use active voice and strong verbs:**  Instead of "It is du story de whereof happened," try something like "The clock ticked, each second a hammer blow against Dagmar's fragile hope."

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:**  The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand the situation clearly. This hinders the ability to build suspense.
* **Lack of Context:** We don't know who Robert Bent is, why he's in critical condition, or what the significance of the organs is. Without context, there's no emotional investment in the outcome.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("organs disembarked") makes the action feel distant and less impactful.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Be grammatically corrected:**  Clear and concise language will help the reader understand the situation quickly.
* **Provide more context:**  Who is Robert Bent? What kind of organs are being transported?  Why is this a critical moment?
* **Use active voice and strong verbs:**  Instead of "organs disembarked," try something like "The helicopter doors swung open, revealing a precious cargo."
* **Hint at a potential problem:** Is there a delay? Is there a risk of complications? Adding a sense of uncertainty will heighten the tension.

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The paragraph is riddled with grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand the situation.
* **Lack of Context:** We have no idea why a clean floor in a stairwell is suspenseful. There's no sense of danger or mystery.

* **Introduce a hint of danger:**  Perhaps the cleaner hears a noise, or sees something out of place.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:
