 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The narrative sets up a tense situation with the impending liver transplant and the critical condition of the young boy, Robert Bent. The uncertainty about whether he will survive the wait and the unexpected turn of events with the death of the donor add to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the events leading up to the transplant and the emotional impact on the characters involved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph does not provide any new information about the critical situation of Robert Bent or the impending liver transplant, and the landing of the helicopter is a common occurrence in hospitals. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the helicopter's mission, the urgency of the situation, or the emotions of the characters involved. 2  At 08:57, the helicopter carrying the life-saving liver for Robert Bent's transplant landed on the roof of the hospital, but the medical team was not prepared for the unexpected complication that would arise. The organ was damaged in transit, and the team had to scramble to find a backup donor before it was too late. The clock was ticking, and the fate of young Robert Bent hung in the balance. 3.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the critical situation of the patient and the need for the medical team to act quickly. The description of the men descending from the helicopter and the focus on the blue case containing the liver adds to the tension. The use of sensory details such as the sound of the blades and the wind blowing the men's hair also helps to create a vivid and immersive scene. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the patient's condition, the emotions of the medical team, or the consequences of failing to complete the transplant in time. 3. Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them clutched a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver that could save the life of a critically ill patient. The other shouted something inaudible over the noise of the blades. Realizing that he hadn't managed to make himself heard, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at his watch, and then at the doorway off the roof. The man transporting the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. The team had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. 4.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph describes a routine cleaning task and does not create a sense of tension or urgency. The focus on the cleaner's mundane tasks and the lack of any mention of a critical situation or impending event makes the paragraph not suspenseful. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to incorporate elements of mystery, danger, or unexpected events. 4. Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital's eight floors. It wasn't a particularly interesting job. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of color on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there were always a bored patient eager to have a chat. Generally, it was an agreeable labor. Yet, the service stairwell wasn't dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases dispersed in the building's wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket, and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn't disturb the "wet floor" warning signs at the top of each section. Whom morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley, and continued his typical workday. Suddenly, he heard a loud crash coming from the roof of the hospital. He froze, his heart pounding in his chest, as he listened intently, wondering what could have caused such a noise. 5.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph provides some details about the layout of the hospital and the location of the service stairwell, but it does not create a sense of tension or urgency. The focus on the men carrying the liver and their conversation about taking the stairs or the lift does not build suspense. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to incorporate elements of mystery, danger, or unexpected events. 5. The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing, there was another door leading onto one of the hospital's secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom, and finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case approached the door, but his colleague caught his arm. "The patient on the 6th floor is critical. It's not worth taking the lift," he said, realizing his colleague's intention. "By the time we get there and wait for him to come, it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors." His colleague hesitated, then nodded and moved away from the door, holding the railing of the service stairwell with his free hand. Suddenly, they heard a loud crash coming from the roof of the hospital. They exchanged a worried glance, wondering what could have caused such a noise. 6.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the man's slip on the stairs and the potential for the case to be damaged or lost. The use of sensory details such as the sound of the case rolling down the stairs adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the consequences of the case being damaged or lost, or if it described the emotions of the men as they watched the case roll down the stairs. 6. His footing slipped as he placed it on the first step, and he rotated his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised, he couldn't stay upright. Without thinking, he reached out to grab hold of the railing with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs while the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they looked in dread as the case spun over everything, making a noise that sounded like a bag of loose keys being shaken. The man's heart raced as he wondered if the case would make it to the bottom of the stairs in one piece. 7. His footing slipped as he placed it on the first step, and he rotated his ankle.

The focus on the man going to find the medical team does not build suspense. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to incorporate elements of mystery, danger, or unexpected events. 7. Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. "Gifts'ton!" warned his colleague, "We don't know if it's been damaged. It's best to call the doctors." The other nodded, pulling back his hand. "I'll go," continued the first. "You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes." Without wasting any time, he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and moved through the complicated network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. Suddenly, they heard a loud crash coming from the roof of the hospital. They exchanged a worried glance, wondering what could have caused such a noise. 8.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the man's injury and his superstition that the condition of the liver depends on his suffering. The focus on the doctors rushing up the service stairwell adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the doctors' reactions or the condition of the liver. 8. Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold of the railing, his colleague hadn't moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibilities that the contents of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, while the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overcome by the superstition that the condition of that liver in nearly came down to the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors had soon arrived. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Directly, three doctors seemed, followed by his colleague. "Move aside, please," asked one of the physicians, who was kneeling down next to the case. The other doctors gathered around, their faces serious and focused. The man held his breath, wondering if the liver was still viable. 9. Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold of the railing, his colleague hadn't moved.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the damaged case and the potential for the liver to be ruined. The use of sensory details such as the sound of the click and the slow escape of refrigerated air adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the doctors' reactions or the consequences of the damaged case. 9. He heard a click when the doctor pressed the end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided for two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look, the doctor turned to those watching, shaking her head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side of which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The doctors exchanged worried glances, wondering if the liver was still viable. The man's heart raced as he watched the air escape, hoping that the liver would still be usable. Suddenly, they heard a loud crash coming from the roof of the hospital. They exchanged a worried glance, wondering what could have caused such a noise. 10.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the delicate nature of the biopsy and the potential for the liver to be damaged. The use of sensory details such as the surgeon's nervousness and the focus on the small syringe adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the consequences of damaging the liver or the emotions of the medical team. 10. According to the original diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this, it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent metastasis. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies before, but never before had a child's life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimeter out, he would damage the organ irreparably. The man's heart raced as he watched the surgeon work, his hands shaking slightly as he held his breath. Suddenly, they heard a loud crash coming from the roof of the hospital. They exchanged a worried glance, wondering what could have caused such a noise. The man's mind raced, thinking of all the possibilities: a helicopter crash, a fire, a bomb explosion. He wondered if the noise had anything to do with the liver transplant and if it would affect their chances of saving the patient. He held his breath, waiting for the surgeon to make a decision. The surgeon's hands trembled as he prepared to make the incision, his heart pounding in his chest. He took a deep breath, focusing on the task at hand, and slowly inserted the syringe into the liver. The man's eyes widened as he watched, his heart in his throat. Would the liver be usable? Would the

 I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension with the surgeon's analysis of the sample and the potential for the liver to have worsened as a result of the impact. The use of sensory details such as the surgeon's pursed lips and the interminable half a minute adds to the suspense. The focus on the metabolic rate and the surgeon's concern also adds to the suspense. 11. Holding his breath, he inserted the needles one centimeter. Relieved for not encountering any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. Now the surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube. As he analyzed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and sounded with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively worsened as a result of the impact. The man's heart raced as he watched, his mind racing with thoughts of the consequences. The doctors exchanged worried glances, wondering if there was anything they could do to save the patient.

Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without being able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damages that the organ sustained in transit. The man's heart sank as he heard the news, his mind racing with thoughts of what could have been. He wondered if there was anything they could have done to save the patient. The doctors exchanged worried glances, their faces pale and somber. The man's mind raced, thinking of all the possibilities: a helicopter crash, a fire, a bomb explosion. He wondered if the noise had anything to do with the liver transplant and if it would affect the other patients in the hospital. He held his breath, wondering what the future held for the hospital and the medical team. The man's heart ached as he thought of the patient's family, who would be devastated by the news. He wondered if they would ever be able to forgive him for not being able to save their loved one. He felt a sense of guilt wash over him, wondering if he could have done something differently to save the patient. He felt a tear roll down his cheek as he realized that he had failed. 13.
