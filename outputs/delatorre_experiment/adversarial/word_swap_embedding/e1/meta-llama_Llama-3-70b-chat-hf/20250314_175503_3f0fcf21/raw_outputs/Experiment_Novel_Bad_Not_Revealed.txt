I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by stating that it's a true story, which can create some initial interest, but it doesn't necessarily create suspense.
* The setup of a medical team preparing for a transplant is somewhat intriguing, but it's a fairly common scenario and doesn't inherently create tension.
* The mention of the donor's body arriving and the team's uncertainty about the patient's survival creates some mild tension, but it's not particularly intense or unexpected.
* The writing style is also quite awkward and hard to follow, which detracts from any potential suspense. The use of non-standard English and grammatical errors makes it difficult to focus on the story.

Overall, while the paragraph tries to create some tension, it falls flat due to the clumsy writing and lack of a compelling or unexpected twist.
