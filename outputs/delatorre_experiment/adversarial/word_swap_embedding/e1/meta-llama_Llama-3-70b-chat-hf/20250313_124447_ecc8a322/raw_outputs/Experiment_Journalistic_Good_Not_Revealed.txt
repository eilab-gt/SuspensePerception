I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and uncertainty by introducing a critical medical procedure (renal transplant) and a patient's life hanging in the balance.
* The use of phrases like "imminent renal transplanted" and "circumstances es crucial" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind.
* The introduction of a potential donor and the uncertainty surrounding the patient's survival adds to the tension.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is somewhat diminished by:

* The awkward and unclear writing style, which can make it difficult for the reader to fully engage with the story.
* The lack of emotional connection with the patient, Robert Bent, who is introduced somewhat abruptly and without much context.
* The somewhat clichéd setup of a medical drama, which may not be particularly original or surprising.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of suspense, it could be improved with clearer writing, more character development, and a more unique or surprising plot twist.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of sudden and dramatic action with the helicopter crash, which grabs the reader's attention.
* The use of specific details like the time "08:57" adds a sense of realism and immediacy to the scene.
* The mention of a character, Kathleen Deformed, in a "critical although stable situation" raises questions about her fate and creates some concern for her well-being.

However, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by:

* The unclear and awkward writing style, which can make it difficult to fully understand what's happening.
* The lack of context about Kathleen's situation and why she's in the hospital, which makes it hard to invest in her fate.
* The somewhat absurd and unrealistic scenario of a helicopter crashing onto a hospital roof, which may strain credibility and reduce tension.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements of surprise and action, it could be improved with clearer writing, more context, and a more believable and suspenseful scenario.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph is quite confusing and unclear, which makes it difficult to understand what's happening and invest in the story.
* The use of awkward phrasing and made-up words ("même minor blu fridge", "du shape of another case") creates a sense of disorientation and distraction.
* The mention of a liver being stored in a case is somewhat intriguing, but it's not clear what this has to do with the helicopter crash or Kathleen's situation, which reduces the sense of tension or suspense.

Overall, the paragraph's suspensefulness is limited by its unclear and confusing writing style, which makes it hard to follow and invest in the story. To increase suspense, the paragraph would need to be rewritten for clarity and coherence, and would need to create a clearer sense of tension or danger.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph is extremely mundane and focuses on a routine activity (a cleaner mopping the floor) that doesn't inherently create tension or suspense.
* The lack of connection to the previous paragraphs or any larger plot makes it difficult to see how this event is relevant or important.
* The only potential source of tension (the cleaner not leaving a "wetted floor" sign) is a relatively minor issue that doesn't create a sense of danger or urgency.

Overall, the paragraph is very low on suspense and doesn't contribute much to the story. To increase suspense, the paragraph would need to be rewritten to create a sense of tension or danger, or to reveal important information that advances the plot.

I would rate this paragraph a 3 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of potential danger or accident by mentioning that the two men transporting the liver (which is presumably important and fragile) are taking a risk by not using the elevator and instead walking down the stairs.
* The use of the phrase "forgot de ceilings" is unclear, but it could suggest that the men are not taking proper precautions or are not aware of their surroundings, which adds to the sense of potential danger.
* However, the paragraph is still quite vague and doesn't create a strong sense of tension or urgency. The stakes are not clearly established, and it's not clear what would happen if the men were to drop the liver or encounter any obstacles.

Overall, the paragraph has some elements of suspense, but it could be improved by making the stakes clearer, creating a greater sense of tension or urgency, and providing more context about the importance of the liver and the consequences of failure.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sudden and dramatic turn of events, with the case containing the liver plummeting downwards, which is a critical and potentially disastrous moment.
* The use of words like "slipped" and "plummeted" creates a sense of suddenness and urgency, which adds to the tension.
* The phrase "the moment the fella ferrying the case placed sa footing on the measure" creates a sense of anticipation and sets up the accident that follows.
* The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a bit unclear and awkwardly written, which can detract from the suspense. However, the core elements of the scene are well-executed and create a strong sense of tension.

Overall, this paragraph is much more suspenseful than the previous ones, and it effectively creates a sense of danger and urgency. With some polishing to clarify the writing, it could be even more effective.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of relief and tension release after the dramatic event of the previous paragraph, which can be suspenseful in its own right.
* The use of words like "promptly" and "cautionary" creates a sense of urgency and importance, which adds to the tension.
* The image of the colleague rushing to get medical help while the other person stays to supervise the case creates a sense of drama and high stakes.
* However, the paragraph also creates a sense of resolution and stability, which reduces the suspense. The fact that the person regains their footing and the case is not handled until the medicine arrives creates a sense of control and safety, which reduces the tension.

Overall, this paragraph is moderately suspenseful, but it's more focused on creating a sense of drama and urgency than on building tension or suspense. It's a necessary step in the story to create a sense of resolution, but it's not as suspenseful as some of the other paragraphs.

Here's why:

* The paragraph creates a sense of sudden and dramatic revelation, with the medical team discovering that the liver has been damaged.

* The fact that the liver was being transported for a critical medical procedure adds to the stakes and makes the damage more consequential.
* The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a bit unclearly written, with phrases like "du case" and "hers uncovered ec" that can detract from the suspense. However, the core elements of the scene are well-executed and create a strong sense of tension.

Overall, this paragraph is very suspenseful and effectively creates a sense of drama and urgency. The sudden revelation of the damaged liver raises the stakes and creates a sense of tension that propels the story forward.
