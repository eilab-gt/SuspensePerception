  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

4. The use of phrases like "just the day before" and "finally" creates a sense of anticipation and builds up to the climax of the story.

However, there are a few things that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite short, which means that the suspense is not built up over a long period of time.
2. The cause of Robert's death is revealed relatively quickly in the paragraph, which takes away some of the mystery and suspense.
3. The language used is relatively straightforward and not overly dramatic, which means that the paragraph does not have the same level of emotional intensity as a more suspenseful story.
