  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a clear and compelling situation, with a young boy named Robert who is in critical condition and waiting for a liver transplant. The fact that a suitable donor has been found adds to the tension, as does the uncertainty of whether Robert will survive the wait. The use of phrases like "just the day before" and "not sure if Robert would survive the wait" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the outcome of the story.

However, the paragraph does not provide any concrete details or clues about what will happen next, which keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert and whether he will receive the transplant, but the paragraph does not provide any concrete hints or red herrings to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph provides some important details about the timing of the helicopter's landing and Robert's condition, which creates a sense of tension and anticipation. The use of the word "punctually" suggests that the landing was exact and precise, which adds to the sense of urgency and importance. The fact that Robert is in a critical but stable condition also raises questions about his fate and whether he will survive the transplant.

However, the paragraph does not provide any concrete details or clues about what will happen next, which keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Robert and whether the transplant will be successful, but the paragraph does not provide any concrete hints or red herrings to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the men's rush to deliver the compatible liver to the patient, who is in a critical situation. The use of phrases like "the rotors were still turning" and "they had no time to lose" adds to the sense of urgency and raises questions about the outcome of the situation. The description of the men's actions, such as the one shouting something inaudible and the other nodding and pointing at the watch and the doorway, creates a sense of confusion and uncertainty, which adds to the suspense.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness is that it does not provide any concrete clues or hints about what will happen next. The reader is left wondering what will happen to the patient and whether the men will be able to deliver the liver in time, but the paragraph does not provide any concrete hints or red herrings to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the lack of excitement in his job, which creates a sense of monotony and predictability. The use of phrases like "not particularly interesting job," "agreeable job," and "like every morning" reinforces this sense of routine and lack of suspense. The paragraph also provides some mundane details about the cleaner's work, such as the location of the fire extinguishers and the fact that the service stairwell is not dirty, which further reduces the sense of tension or suspense.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 1 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness is the mention of the cleaner whistling as he works, which could potentially be a red herring or a sign of something unexpected happening later in the story. However, this detail is not developed further in the paragraph, so it does not add much to the overall suspense level.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a clear conflict and time-sensitive situation, with the need to deliver the organ to the patient on the 6th floor before it's too late. The use of phrases like "not worth taking the lift" and "it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about the outcome of the situation. The fact that the man carrying the case is hesitant to take the lift adds to the suspense, as it suggests that something could go wrong.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness is that it does not provide any concrete clues or hints about what will happen next. The reader is left wondering what will happen to the patient and whether the men will be able to deliver the organ in time, but the paragraph does not provide any concrete hints or red herrings to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

  I would rate this paragraph as an 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a dangerous and high-stakes situation, with the man struggling to maintain his balance and avoid falling down the stairs while holding onto the bannister. The use of sensory details like "twisting his ankle" and "a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag" creates a vivid and intense atmosphere, raising questions about the outcome of the situation. The fact that the case rolls down the stairs and out of the man's reach adds to the suspense, as it suggests that something valuable and important may be lost.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness is that it is a relatively short paragraph, and some readers may find it a bit predictable given the straightforward cause-and-effect sequence of events. However, the paragraph does an excellent job of creating a sense of tension and uncertainty, and it effectively sets up the stakes for the rest of the story.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and uncertainty by introducing a potential problem with the case (it may have been damaged during the fall) and raising questions about the outcome of the situation. The use of phrases like "we don't know if it's been damaged" and "it's best to call the doctors" adds to the suspense, as it suggests that something important and potentially dangerous may be at stake. The fact that the first man is sent to alert the medical team while the second man stays behind to watch the case adds to the tension, as it creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen next.

However, the paragraph is not as suspenseful as it could be because it is relatively short and lacks concrete details about the potential consequences of the damaged case. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, but the paragraph does not provide enough information to create a strong sense of tension or uncertainty.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 8 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and uncertainty by introducing a potential problem (the possibility that the contents of the package have been damaged) and raising questions about the outcome of the situation. The use of phrases like "keeping a firm hold on the bannister" and "overwhelmed by the superstition" adds to the suspense, as it suggests that the protagonist is in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation. The fact that the doctors appear and ask the protagonist to move away adds to the tension, as it raises questions about what the doctors will find and what will happen next.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness is that it is relatively short and lacks concrete details about the potential consequences of the damaged case.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of tension and uncertainty by introducing a mysterious and seemingly impossible object (a fridge that can divide in two and rupture with impact) and raising questions about what it contains and what will happen next. The use of sensory details like "click," "thumbs," "brief look," and "stream of refrigerated air" adds to the suspense, as it creates a vivid and intense atmosphere. The fact that the doctor shakes his head and closes the case adds to the tension, as it raises questions about what the doctor has found and what will happen next.

The paragraph is very suspensful because it provides a clear and intriguing mystery that the reader wants to see resolved. The use of concrete and vivid details creates a sense of realism and immediacy, making it difficult for the reader to put the paragraph down and eager to find out what happens next.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 10 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates an intense and nerve-wracking atmosphere by describing a critical and high-stakes medical procedure. The use of phrases like "urgently transferred," "superficial condition appeared to be correct," "hope," "depended on," "necessary," "nervous," and "one millimetre out" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, raising questions about the outcome of the procedure and the fate of the child. The use of sensory details like "face covered by a mask," "everyone else in the laboratory moved back," and "gloved hands guided a small syringe" adds to the suspense, as it creates a vivid and intense atmosphere.

The use of phrases like "organising his breath," "inserted the needle," "carefully drew out the plunger," "satisfied," "wiped the sweat from his brow," and "anxiously awaiting the diagnosis" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, raising questions about the outcome of the procedure and the fate of the patient.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some information about the liver transplant and the verification of its function, it does not create a sense of tension or uncertainty that would keep the reader engaged and eager to know more. The time frame mentioned in the paragraph ("21:26") and the lack of any obstacles or complications in the transplant process make it seem like a straightforward and uneventful procedure, which reduces the suspensefulness of the paragraph.
