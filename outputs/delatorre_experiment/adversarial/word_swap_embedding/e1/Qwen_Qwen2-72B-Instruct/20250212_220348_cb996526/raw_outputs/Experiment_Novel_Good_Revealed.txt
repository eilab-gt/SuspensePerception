The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a high-stakes medical procedure and uncertainty about the outcome. The fact that the boy's situation was critical and that the success of the transplant was in doubt adds to the tension. However, the paragraph does not build up the suspense in a particularly dramatic way, and the outcome is revealed relatively early on. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 5 on the 9-point scale.
