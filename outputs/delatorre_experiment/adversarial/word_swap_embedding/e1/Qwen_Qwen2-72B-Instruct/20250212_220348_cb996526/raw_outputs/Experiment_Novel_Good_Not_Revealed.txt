The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense. It sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear time frame and a life-or-death outcome. The uncertainty about whether the boy will survive the wait for the transplant adds to the tension. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. It's not the highest level of suspense because the outcome is not in doubt for the reader (since it is presented as a historical event), but the situation itself is inherently suspenseful.
