The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a child's life hanging in the balance and the uncertainty of whether he will survive until the transplant can be performed. However, the writing style is somewhat dry and factual, which detracts from the tension. I would rate it a 5 or 6 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph has a low level of suspense as it simply states that the helicopter carrying the organ landed on time and that the patient's condition is critical but stable. There is no indication of any potential problems or complications that could arise. I would rate it a 2 or 3 on the 9-point scale. However, the fact that the organ has arrived and the patient's condition is stable could be seen as a relief, which could create a sense of resolution rather than suspense.

The fact that the patient is in a critical situation and that time is of the essence adds to the suspense. I would rate it a 7 or 8 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph has a very low level of suspense as it describes the mundane task of a cleaner dusting the floor of a service stairwell in a hospital. There is no indication of any potential problems or complications that could arise, and the description of the cleaner's routine is not particularly engaging. I would rate it a 1 or 2 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph seems to be setting up a contrast between the routine of the cleaner and the high-stakes situation of the organ transplant, but it does not create any tension or suspense in itself.

I would rate it a 6 or 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a moderate level of suspense by introducing a potential problem with the organ and the need for quick action to address it. However, the fact that the man is able to quickly reach the medical team and alert them to the problem reduces the level of suspense somewhat.

The description of his superstition that the condition of the organ depends on his suffering adds to the sense of urgency and the potential for complications. The arrival of the doctors and their request for him to move away from the case creates a sense of resolution, but also raises the question of whether the organ has been damaged. I would rate it a 6 or 7 on the 9-point scale.

However, the arrival of the doctors and their quick action reduces the level of suspense somewhat.
