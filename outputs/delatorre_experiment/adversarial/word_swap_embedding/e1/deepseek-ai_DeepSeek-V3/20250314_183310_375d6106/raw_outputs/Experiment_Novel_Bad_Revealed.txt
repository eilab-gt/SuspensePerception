I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. Here’s why:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, mixed languages, and unclear phrasing. This makes it hard to build suspense.
2. **Emotional Engagement**: While the subject matter (a child’s liver transplant and subsequent death) is inherently emotional, the way it’s presented lacks the tension and pacing needed to create suspense.
3. **Pacing**: The paragraph jumps quickly from one event to another without building anticipation or focusing on key moments that could heighten suspense.
4. **Outcome Revealed Early**: The fact that Robert dies is mentioned early in the paragraph, which removes much of the potential suspense about his fate.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could focus more on the uncertainty of the situation, the emotional stakes, and the tension of waiting for the donor organ, while delaying the revelation of the outcome.

I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here’s why:

1. **Potential for Suspense**: The scenario—a helicopter transport arriving for a patient in a critical condition—has inherent suspenseful elements. However, the paragraph doesn’t fully capitalize on this potential.
2. **Lack of Detail**: The paragraph is very brief and lacks details that could build tension, such as the urgency of the situation, the stakes for the patient, or the emotions of those involved.
3. **Pacing**: The sentence is straightforward and doesn’t create a sense of anticipation or uncertainty. It simply states what happened without drawing the reader into the moment.
4. **Emotional Engagement**: There’s no emotional hook to make the reader care about Kathleen Crooked or the outcome of her situation.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could describe the urgency of the helicopter’s arrival, the tension in the hospital, or the critical nature of Kathleen’s condition, while leaving some uncertainty about what will happen next.
