I would rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The paragraph is difficult to follow due to grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and mixed languages (e.g., "Unless Frances, Californian," "per tale," "du du body"). This makes it hard to engage with the story and feel suspense.
2. **Emotional Engagement**: While the situation (a young boy awaiting a kidney transplant) is inherently tense, the writing style doesn't effectively convey the urgency or emotional stakes.
3. **Pacing and Build-Up**: There is no clear build-up or escalation of tension. The paragraph simply states the facts without creating anticipation or curiosity about what might happen next.

To increase suspense, the writing could focus on clearer language, emotional details, and a more structured narrative that builds tension.
