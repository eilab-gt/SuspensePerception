This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine work in the hospital, which, while it sets the scene and establishes a sense of normalcy, does not inherently create a sense of danger or impending crisis. The mundane nature of the job and the cleaner's habits, such as whistling while he works and not using "wet floor" signs, are described in a way that does not suggest any immediate threat or conflict. The mention of the cleaner's routine and the lack of significant events or tension-building elements keep the suspense level relatively low. However, there is a subtle hint of potential risk with the omission of the "wet floor" signs, which could lead to an accident, but this is not enough to significantly raise the suspense factor on its own. The paragraph could be made more suspenseful by introducing an unexpected event or foreshadowing a problem related to the cleaner's actions.
