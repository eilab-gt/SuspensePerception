The paragraph effectively builds suspense by setting the scene of a critical medical situation involving a young boy in dire need of a liver transplant. The mention of a suitable donor being found the day before creates a sense of urgency and hope, which is then juxtaposed with the uncertainty of whether the boy will survive the wait. The specificity of the time (21:26) and the tragic outcome—the death of Roberta Bent without the transplant occurring—adds to the suspensefulness by revealing the stakes and the emotional weight of the situation. The reader is left with questions about what exactly happened to the organ in transit and the impact of these events on the characters involved, which contributes to a high level of suspense.

This paragraph holds a moderate level of suspense. The specificity of the time (08:57) and the mention of a helicopter carrying "de agencies" suggests an important event is about to unfold. The reader is given the impression that something significant is happening, especially with the mention of Robert Bent's critical condition. However, the suspense is somewhat limited because there is no immediate threat or complication presented in the paragraph itself. The reader is left to infer the urgency based on context clues and the knowledge that a helicopter's involvement often indicates a serious situation. The suspense could be heightened with additional details about potential risks, unexpected developments, or the importance of the timing for Robert Bent's condition.

The reader is left in suspense about whether the transplant team will successfully deliver the liver in time to save the patient, given the critical nature of the situation. The paragraph effectively uses descriptive language and situational cues to create a compelling sense of suspense.

This paragraph is not very suspenseful. It provides a detailed account of a cleaner's routine job of mopping the service stairwell in a hospital, emphasizing the mundane and repetitive nature of the task. The description of the cleaner's actions and thoughts suggests a normal, uneventful day at work. While there is a mention of the wildfire extinguishers and the lack of windows in the stairwell, these elements do not immediately contribute to a sense of impending danger or tension. The paragraph lacks an event or a hint of conflict that would typically generate suspense. It sets a scene and provides background information, but on its own, it does not create a strong sense of anticipation or concern for what might happen next, which are key components of suspense.

The specific instructions given ("You remains here watching it, in case everyone comes") and the careful descent of the stairs to avoid another accident add to the sense of urgency. The reader is kept in anticipation, waiting to find out if the organ is still viable for transplant and whether the patient's life can be saved, which are critical questions that sustain the suspense.
