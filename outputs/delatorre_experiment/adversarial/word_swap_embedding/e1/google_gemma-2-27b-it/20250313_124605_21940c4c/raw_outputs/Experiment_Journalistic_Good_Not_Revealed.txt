Here's why:

* **Confusing Language:** The writing is riddled with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, making it difficult to follow the story and build tension. 
* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While there's a hint of uncertainty about Robert Bent's survival, it's not presented in a way that creates a strong sense of danger or anticipation.
* **Passive Voice:** The overuse of passive voice ("was uncovered," "were all ready") distances the reader from the action and reduces the impact.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Clear and Concise Writing:**  Correct the grammatical errors and use clear, direct language.
* **Establish a Clear Threat:** Make the stakes higher by explicitly stating the potential consequences if the transplant fails.
* **Active Voice:** Use active voice to make the writing more dynamic and engaging.
* **Sensory Details:**  Add vivid descriptions to help the reader experience the tension and anxiety of the situation.

This paragraph scores a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Situation:** The image of a helicopter carrying a body landing on a hospital roof is inherently dramatic and raises questions.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The precise time ("08:57") and the word "punctually" add a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Vague Details:** The lack of context about who the body is and why it's being transported leaves the reader wanting to know more.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Build Atmosphere:** Add sensory details to create a more immersive experience. Describe the sound of the helicopter, the reactions of people on the ground, the tension in the air.
* **Hint at the Stakes:**  Give the reader a glimpse into the potential consequences of this event. Is the body a patient in need of urgent care? Is there a threat involved?
* **Delay Gratification:** Don't reveal all the information at once.  Keep the reader guessing by withholding key details until later in the story.

This paragraph scores a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

This paragraph scores a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

This paragraph scores a **7** on the suspensefulness scale.

* **Foreshadowing:** The paragraph subtly foreshadows a potential disaster. The reader knows the stairs are wet and unguarded, and the men are unaware of the danger.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Internal Monologue:** Give the reader access to the thoughts and feelings of one of the men. Are they tired? Distracted? This will make their potential fall more personal and impactful.
* **Slow Down the Pace:** Describe their descent step by step, highlighting the slick surface and the increasing sense of unease.
* **Climax:** Build to a climactic moment where the man slips, leaving the reader hanging on the edge of their seat.

####################################################################################################
This paragraph scores a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a resolution to the immediate danger, with the colleague alerting the medics and the man securing the case. This release of tension lowers the suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("was travelled," "was supervised") distances the reader from the action and reduces the impact.

####################################################################################################
This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Anti-climactic:** After the build-up of tension in the previous paragraphs, this sentence is very anticlimactic. It simply states a fact without any drama or detail.
* **Lack of Detail:**  We don't know anything about the medics' reaction, the state of the patient, or the condition of the liver.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating that the medics arrived, describe their arrival. Are they rushing in with urgency? Are they carrying equipment?
* **Focus on a Character:** Show the reaction of the man who dropped the case. Is he relieved? Anxious?

This paragraph scores a **7** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The rupture of the backpack implies that the liver may be damaged, jeopardizing the transplant and potentially the patient's life.
* **Open Ending:** The paragraph ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering about the fate of the liver and the patient.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Describe the Damage:** Provide more detail about the extent of the damage to the backpack and the liver. Is it a small tear or a complete rupture?

####################################################################################################
This paragraph scores a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Lingering Threat:** The paragraph maintains a sense of suspense by highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the liver's condition. The biopsy suggests there's still a chance it might be unusable.

####################################################################################################
This paragraph scores a **6** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Relief and Tension:** The paragraph provides a sense of relief that the liver survived the fall, but it also maintains tension by emphasizing the delicate nature of the situation. The phrase "it were achievable" suggests there's still a risk involved.
* **Technical Language:** The use of technical language like "analysis exhibited" and "achievable de utilizes" adds a layer of realism but might make the paragraph feel a bit dry.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of simply stating that the liver is usable, describe the surgeon's reaction to the news. Are they relieved? Cautious?
* **Build Anticipation:**  Describe the preparations for the transplant. Is there a sense of urgency? Are there any last-minute complications?
* **Foreshadowing:** Hint at potential challenges during the surgery. Will the transplant be successful?

Here's why:

* **Lingering Threat:** The mention of "paras damages" and the phrase "it sustained for wheeling" introduces a lingering threat.  What were these damages? Could they still pose a risk?
* **Open Ending:** The paragraph ends without explicitly stating whether Robert Bent will fully recover. This leaves the reader wondering about his long-term prognosis.

**To improve suspense:**
