I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines establish a real-life event and a high-stakes situation (a child needing a liver transplant). This immediately grabs the reader's attention.
* **Ticking Clock:** The mention of a specific time (8 a.m.) and the waiting for the organ creates a sense of urgency.
* **Uncertain Outcome:** The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would live the wait" introduces doubt and suspense about the boy's survival.

**However:**

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous typos and grammatical errors distract from the suspense and make the writing feel amateurish.
* **Lack of Tension Building:** The paragraph doesn't effectively build tension. It reveals the tragic outcome too soon, diminishing the suspense.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Polish the writing:** Correct the errors to create a more professional and engaging read.
* **Delay the reveal:**  Hold back the information about Robert's death until later in the story. Focus on the mounting anxiety and hope during the wait.

* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("was in a critical but stable condition") makes the writing feel distant and less engaging.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his labored breathing, the worried faces of the medical team, or the beeping of monitors.
* **Use Active Voice:**  "Robert lay in a critical but stable condition" is more direct and impactful.
* **Build Anticipation:**  Hint at potential complications or obstacles that could arise during the transplant.
