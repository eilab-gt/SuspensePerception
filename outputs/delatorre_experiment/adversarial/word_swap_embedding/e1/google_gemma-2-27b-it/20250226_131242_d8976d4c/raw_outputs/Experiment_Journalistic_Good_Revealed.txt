I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It reveals the outcome:** The paragraph states that the transplant was successful, removing a major element of suspense. We know Robert survives.
* **Passive voice and awkward phrasing:** The writing style is a bit clunky and distances the reader from the emotional stakes. 
* **Lack of tension-building:** There's no sense of urgency or immediate danger conveyed. The paragraph simply lays out the facts.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on Robert's condition:** Describe his struggles and the fear surrounding his situation.
* **Highlight the ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time before the transplant becomes impossible.
* **Use more active and evocative language:**  Paint a vivid picture of the hospital environment and the emotions of those involved.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Introduction of a deadline:** The mention of the helicopter landing with the organ creates a sense of urgency and anticipation. We know the clock is ticking.
* **"Pivotal but stable condition":** This phrase hints at the precariousness of Robert's situation, adding a layer of tension.

**However:**

* **Lack of detail:** The paragraph is quite brief and lacks vivid imagery or emotional engagement. We don't feel the weight of the situation as strongly as we could.
* **Passive voice:** "The organ landed" is a bit flat. Using active voice and stronger verbs could heighten the suspense.


To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Show Robert's reaction:** How does he feel knowing the organ has arrived?
* **Focus on the journey of the organ:**  Was the transport difficult? Were there any close calls?

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Visual imagery:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter with the blue fridge creates a strong visual and adds a sense of importance to the cargo.
* **Intrigue:** The phrase "fully functioning liver" emphasizes the preciousness of the organ and raises the stakes.

**However:**

* **Lack of emotional connection:** We still don't feel a strong connection to Robert or the urgency of his situation.
* **Telling instead of showing:** The paragraph tells us the liver is functioning, but doesn't show us any evidence of this.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Focus on the men's expressions:** Are they tense? Focused? Worried?
* **Describe the condition of the fridge:** Is it battered? Pristine? Does it make any noises?
* **Hint at potential complications:** Is the journey taking longer than expected? Are there any obstacles in their way?

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Foreshadowing:** The paragraph introduces a potential danger – the wet floor – without explicitly stating the consequences. This creates a sense of anticipation and dread.
* **Timing:** The mention of "minutes earlier" emphasizes the close proximity of the events, heightening the tension.

**However:**

* **Lack of connection to the main plot:**  While suspenseful, the paragraph feels somewhat disconnected from the story of Robert's transplant. We need to understand how this wet floor might impact the situation.
* **Passive voice:** "The cleaner had finished" is a bit bland. Using active voice and stronger verbs could make the scene more immediate.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Connect the wet floor to the organ transport:** Will the men carrying the liver slip and fall? Will the fridge be damaged?
* **Show the cleaner's actions:** Was he careless? Distracted? Did he intentionally forget the sign?
* **Build atmosphere:** Describe the dimly lit stairwell, the echoing sound of footsteps, the feeling of unease.
