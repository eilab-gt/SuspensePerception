I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing premise:** The opening line about a real event and a child needing a liver transplant immediately grabs attention.
* **High stakes:** The mention of a critical situation and the uncertainty of survival creates tension.
* **Weak execution:** The paragraph suffers from several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing ("called Cynthia Bent" instead of "named Cynthia Bent," "treating himself" instead of "treating him"). This detracts from the overall impact and makes it harder to fully immerse in the suspense.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Polish the writing:** Correct the grammatical errors and improve the flow of the sentences.
* **Build anticipation:**  Focus on the ticking clock element. How long can Robert wait? What are the risks involved?
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that Robert's situation is critical, describe his symptoms or the worried expressions of the medical team.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Sense of urgency:** The precise time (08:57) and the mention of a helicopter landing create a sense of immediacy and anticipation.
* **Contrasting information:** The statement that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" adds a layer of uncertainty. Will the transplant arrive in time?

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Action and urgency:** The description of the men descending from the helicopter and rushing towards the hospital entrance conveys a sense of urgency.
* **Grammatical errors and awkward phrasing:** The numerous errors distract from the suspense and make it difficult to follow the action. This undermines the overall impact.
* **Lack of emotional connection:** We don't get a sense of the characters' emotions or the weight of the situation.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Polish the writing:** Correct the grammatical errors and improve the flow of the sentences.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that the patient is in a critical situation, describe the scene inside the hospital. Is Robert's family anxiously waiting? Are the doctors preparing for the surgery?

* **Build tension:**  Highlight the ticking clock element. How much time do they have before it's too late?

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Mundane setting:** The focus on the cleaner's routine and the description of the dull stairwell create a sense of ordinariness, which works against suspense.
* **Lack of conflict or threat:** There's no immediate danger or sense of impending doom. The paragraph simply describes a typical workday.
* **Passive voice and lack of tension:** The writing is largely passive and lacks the urgency or emotional intensity needed to build suspense.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Introduce a threat:**  Perhaps the cleaner discovers something unusual in the stairwell, or maybe he overhears a conversation that hints at danger.
* **Focus on the cleaner's perspective:** Show his thoughts and feelings as he notices something amiss. Does he feel uneasy? Is he trying to ignore a growing sense of dread?
* **Create a sense of foreboding:** Use descriptive language to evoke a creepy or unsettling atmosphere.

This paragraph could be rewritten to be more suspenseful by connecting it to the events surrounding the liver transplant. Perhaps the cleaner stumbles upon a clue that could jeopardize the operation, or maybe he witnesses something that puts the patient in danger.
