I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and needs the transplant to survive. This creates some tension.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The wait for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential problems:** The mention of the liver being damaged in transit raises the possibility of complications.

However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right at the end of the paragraph. This removes much of the suspense.
* **The language is factual and lacks emotional weight:** The writing style is more informative than gripping.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader wondering about Robert's fate until later in the story.
* **Focus on Robert's emotional state:** Show his fear, hope, or desperation.
* **Use more vivid language and sensory details:**  Paint a picture of the tense atmosphere in the hospital.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It introduces a sense of urgency:** The mention of a helicopter carrying a vital organ landing creates a feeling of importance and time pressure.

However:

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Show the reactions of the characters:** Describe the tension in the room as the helicopter arrives, or the relief/anxiety on the medical team's faces.
* **Use more evocative language:** Instead of "landed punctually," consider phrases like "touched down with a thud" or "descended like a lifeline."
* **Create a sense of anticipation:**  Hint at the potential complications that could arise during the transplant.

Here's why:
