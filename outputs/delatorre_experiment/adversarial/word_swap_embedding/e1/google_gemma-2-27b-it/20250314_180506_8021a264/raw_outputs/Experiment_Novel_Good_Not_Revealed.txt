I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

* **Lack of Vivid Language:** The language is very straightforward and lacks descriptive details that could evoke emotion or create a sense of urgency.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammatical errors.**
* **Use more vivid language and sensory details to describe the setting and the characters' emotions.**
* **Focus on building tension gradually by revealing information slowly and hinting at potential complications.**
* **End the paragraph on a cliffhanger to leave the reader wanting more.**
