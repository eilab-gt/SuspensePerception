I would rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing make it difficult to follow the story and build tension. 
* **Lack of Vivid Language:** The writing lacks sensory details and strong verbs that could create a sense of urgency or danger.
* **Info Dumping:** The paragraph presents a lot of information upfront (location, date, medical details) without weaving it into a compelling narrative.

**To improve the suspensefulness:**

* **Correct the grammar and sentence structure.**
* **Focus on a specific moment of tension.** Instead of summarizing the situation, zoom in on a particular action or decision.
* **Use vivid language to create a sense of atmosphere and emotion.** Describe the boy's condition, the doctor's anxiety, the ticking clock.
* **Raise questions in the reader's mind.** Hint at potential complications or obstacles.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** The mention of the time (08:57) and the phrase "disembarked timely" create a sense of urgency. We know the organs are crucial and time is of the essence.
* **Vague Language:** The phrase "new ceilings" is unclear and slightly unsettling. It hints at something unusual or potentially dangerous.
* **Robert's Condition:** The description of Robert's condition as "latest critical though stabilise" is intriguing. It suggests a precarious situation where things could go either way.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his symptoms or the doctors' reactions.
* **Build anticipation:**  Focus on the journey of the organs, perhaps highlighting potential obstacles or delays.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sounds of the helicopter, the sterile environment of the hospital, the tension in the air.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Detail:** The "smaller bleu fridge" and the mention of a "totally functioning liver" pique the reader's curiosity. It suggests something important and potentially fragile is being transported.
* **Unclear Pronouns:** The use of "someone del whom" is confusing and creates a slight sense of unease. Who is this person? What is their role?
* **Lack of Context:** We don't know enough about the situation to feel truly invested. Why is the liver so important? What are the stakes?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Clarify the pronouns:**  Identify the person carrying the fridge and their relationship to the situation.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Hint at the potential consequences if the liver is damaged or delayed.
* **Use stronger verbs and sensory details:** Instead of "carries," use a more active verb like "rushed" or "sprinted." Describe the weight of the fridge, the coldness emanating from it, the urgency in the person's movements.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Connection:** This paragraph feels disconnected from the previous ones. The focus on the cleaner and the "wet flooring" sign doesn't seem relevant to the central tension of the organ transplant.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("had completed hoovering," "leaving or display") creates a sense of distance and detachment.
* **No Immediate Threat:** There's no clear sense of danger or impending disaster.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Connect it to the main plot:**  How does the wet floor sign relate to the organ transplant? Could it pose a danger to the medical team or the organs?
* **Introduce a conflict:** Perhaps the cleaner accidentally spills something, creating a slippery hazard. Or maybe someone ignores the sign and slips, causing a delay.
* **Use active voice and vivid language:**  Show the cleaner rushing to finish their work, the water pooling on the floor, the reflection of the "wet flooring" sign.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Unconventional Action:** The image of three men carrying a liver through a sunroof and down a stairway is unusual and slightly unsettling. It suggests a sense of urgency and a disregard for normal procedures.
* **Vague Language:** The phrase "promenade descending" is a bit ambiguous. Are they walking calmly or rushing down the stairs? This lack of clarity adds to the suspense.
* **Lack of Context:** We still don't know why they're taking this unusual route. Is there a problem with the elevators? Are they trying to avoid someone?

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the weight of the liver, the sound of their footsteps on the stairs, the feeling of urgency in the air.
* **Heighten the stakes:**  Hint at the potential consequences if they're delayed or if something goes wrong.
* **Introduce an obstacle:** Perhaps they encounter someone on the stairs, or the power goes out, plunging them into darkness.

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Sudden Shift:** The paragraph abruptly shifts from a relatively calm scene to a moment of chaos and danger. The unexpected slip and the tumbling case create a jolt for the reader.
* **High Stakes:** The implication that the liver is now tumbling down the stairs raises the stakes considerably. The reader is left wondering if the organ will be damaged.
* **Vague Resolution:** The paragraph ends abruptly, leaving the reader hanging. What happens to the case? Is the liver okay? This lack of resolution intensifies the suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Slow down the action:** Describe the slip in more detail, focusing on the man's reaction and the sound of the case hitting the stairs.
* **Heighten the sensory experience:** Use vivid language to convey the feeling of panic, the clattering sound of the case, the fear that the liver might be ruined.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Mention that time is running out for the transplant, adding to the urgency of the situation.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Immediate Action:** The colleagues rushing to warn the doctors creates a sense of urgency and impending crisis.
* **Unclear Outcome:** The phrase "whose stood not handled during all road" is confusing and adds to the suspense. What exactly is not being handled? What are the potential consequences?
* **Passive Protagonist:** The man who dropped the case is now passively observing, which slightly diminishes the tension.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Clarify the situation:** Explain what "not handled" means and what the potential consequences are for the liver.
* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of saying he "stay supervising," describe his actions and his emotional state. Is he panicked? Determined?
* **Focus on the ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time they have before the liver becomes unusable.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Lack of Detail:** The sentence is very short and lacks any descriptive language or context. We don't know anything about the doctors' reactions or the atmosphere when they arrive.
* **Anti-climactic:** After building suspense in the previous paragraphs, this sentence feels like a letdown. It doesn't offer any new information or raise the stakes.

* **Highlight the urgency:** Mention the sound of their footsteps, their hurried questions, the palpable tension in the air.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Delayed Revelation:** The sentence structure creates a sense of anticipation. We know something is wrong with the case, but the reveal is delayed until the very end.
* **High Stakes:** The discovery that the backpack inside the case has ruptured immediately raises the stakes. This suggests that the liver may be damaged or compromised.
* **Open Ending:** The paragraph ends abruptly, leaving the reader wondering about the condition of the liver and the fate of the patient.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Describe the doctors' reactions:** Show their shock, their fear, their desperate hope that the liver is still salvageable.
* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sight of the ruptured backpack, the smell of something unpleasant, the sound of the doctors' worried whispers.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:** Remind the reader that time is running out for the transplant.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Technical Language:** The use of medical jargon like "hepatic pilot" and "biopsy" creates a sense of seriousness and urgency, but it might also alienate readers who are unfamiliar with these terms.
* **Vague Description:** The paragraph doesn't clearly convey the doctors' emotions or the gravity of the situation. We know they're examining the liver, but we don't know what they're hoping to find or what the potential consequences are.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("brought away for biopsy") weakens the impact of the sentence.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Describe the doctors' actions and expressions as they examine the liver. Are they hopeful? Concerned? Desperate?
* **Use stronger verbs:** Replace passive verbs with active ones. For example, instead of "brought away for biopsy," write "rushed to the lab for immediate examination."
* **Raise the stakes:** Hint at the potential consequences if the liver is damaged. Will the patient die? Will the transplant be delayed?

I'd rate this paragraph a **6** for suspensefulness.

* **Concise Language:** The paragraph is short and to the point, which adds to the impact of the revelation.
* **Lack of Emotional Response:** While the news is devastating, the paragraph doesn't convey the doctors' or the patient's emotional response.

* **Show the doctors' reactions:** Describe their disappointment, their frustration, their sense of helplessness.
* **Focus on the patient:**  Hint at the patient's condition and the potential consequences of not receiving the transplant.
* **Introduce a glimmer of hope:** Perhaps there's another option, a backup plan, or a last-minute chance to save the patient.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Stark Reality:** The declaration of death is a powerful and sobering moment. It brings the story to a tragic climax.
* **Specific Details:** The time (21:26) and the cause of death (injuries sustained during transport) add a sense of realism and finality.
* **Emotional Impact:** While the paragraph is relatively straightforward, the weight of the situation is palpable.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of simply stating that Richard Bent died, describe the scene in the hospital room. Are there family members present? What are the doctors' expressions?
* **Flashback:** Consider adding a brief flashback to a happier moment in Richard's life, highlighting the tragedy of his loss.
* **Lingering Question:** End the paragraph with a question that leaves the reader pondering the events that led to this outcome. For example, "Could anything have been done differently?"
