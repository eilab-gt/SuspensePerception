This paragraph scores a **2** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Grammatical Errors:** The numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing make it difficult to follow the story and build tension. 
* **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph is unclear about the stakes and the potential danger. We know a child needs a transplant, but the urgency and the potential consequences aren't effectively conveyed.

**To improve suspense:**

* **Correct the grammar and punctuation.**

* **Use active voice and vivid language to create a sense of urgency.**
* **Highlight the potential for failure and the high stakes involved.**
