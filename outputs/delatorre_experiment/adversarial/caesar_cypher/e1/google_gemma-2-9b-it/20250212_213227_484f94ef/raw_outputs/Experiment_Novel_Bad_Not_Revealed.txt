I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire â€“ a child's life hangs in the balance, and time is running out.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends with "This is the story of what happened," leaving the reader wanting to know the outcome.

**What's Missing:**

* **Sensory Details:** The paragraph lacks vivid descriptions that could heighten the tension. We don't feel the urgency or the fear in the hospital.

* **Internal Conflict:**  Adding internal thoughts or doubts from Robert or the doctors could create more psychological suspense.


Overall, the paragraph sets up a compelling situation, but it could be made more suspenseful with stronger writing techniques.

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the tedious details of a cleaning routine. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or conflict.
