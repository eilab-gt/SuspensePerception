* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the liver is functioning correctly, but doesn't show us any evidence of this.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Focus on the moment of verification:** Describe the medical team's reactions as they see the first signs of the liver working.
* **Show Robert's response:**  Describe his physical or emotional state as he begins to recover.
