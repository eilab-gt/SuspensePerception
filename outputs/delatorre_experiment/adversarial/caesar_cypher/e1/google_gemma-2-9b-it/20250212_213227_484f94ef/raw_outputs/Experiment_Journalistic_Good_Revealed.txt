I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event and a critical situation immediately grabs attention.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph establishes a clear sense of urgency with the impending transplant and Robert's precarious condition.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for Danger:** The setup suggests a potential hazard (a wet floor) and the absence of a warning sign creates a sense of risk.
* **Lack of Context:**  We don't know who might be using the stairwell, or why their safety is particularly important. Without context, the potential danger feels abstract.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of the passive voice ("the cleaner had finished...") makes the paragraph feel less immediate and engaging.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a character:**  Mention someone who is about to use the stairwell, creating a sense of immediacy and personal stake.
* **Build tension:**  Describe the sound of footsteps approaching, the slippery floor, or the character's obliviousness to the danger.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Shift in Setting:**  Moving from the open roof to the enclosed, potentially hazardous service stairwell creates a sense of claustrophobia and raises the stakes.
* **Choice of Route:** The decision to take the stairwell, rather than a more direct route, suggests a deliberate choice with potential consequences.
* **Lack of Detail:**  The paragraph is relatively brief and lacks vivid descriptions or emotional cues.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Describe the stairwell:**  Paint a picture of the dimly lit, narrow space, perhaps with creaking steps or a musty smell.
* **Show the men's reactions:**  Describe their expressions, their pace, or any hesitation they might feel as they descend.
* **Hint at a threat:**  Mention a strange noise, a flickering light, or a sense of being watched.

I'd rate this paragraph an **8 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Sudden Action:** The paragraph starts with a clear cause-and-effect relationship, building tension towards the inevitable slip.
* **High Stakes:** The object in question is the vital liver, making the potential consequences of the fall incredibly dire.
* **Visual Impact:** The image of the case "plunging down the stairs" is vivid and creates a sense of chaos and urgency.

* **Heighten the stakes:**  Mention the fragility of the liver, the ticking clock, or the potential consequences for Robert's life.



Overall, this paragraph is very effective at creating suspense and leaving the reader on the edge of their seat.
