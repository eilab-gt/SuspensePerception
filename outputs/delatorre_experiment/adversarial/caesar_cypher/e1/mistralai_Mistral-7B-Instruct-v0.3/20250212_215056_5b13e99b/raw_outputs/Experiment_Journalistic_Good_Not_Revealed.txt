 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "suitable donor" and the "wait." However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful by providing more details about Robert's condition, the medical team's concerns, or the potential complications that could arise during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of anticipation with the arrival of the helicopter, but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could describe the medical team's reactions to the helicopter's arrival, or provide more details about the organ and its importance to Robert's survival.  Additionally, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it hinted at potential complications or delays in the transplant process.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds a sense of urgency with the mention of the "fully functioning liver" and the "small blue fridge" that stores it. The use of the word "fridge" may also create a sense of tension, as it suggests that the organ is fragile and must be handled carefully. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful by describing the medical team's reactions to the arrival of the organ, or by providing more details about the organ's importance to Robert's survival.  Additionally, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it hinted at potential complications or delays in the transplant process.  Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but it could be made more so with additional details and a focus on the stakes involved in the transplant.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not add much to the overall suspense of the story, as it does not directly relate to the transplant or Robert's condition. The mention of the cleaner and the "wet floor" may create a sense of tension, but it does not contribute to the main narrative in a significant way. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to show how the cleaner's actions may have impacted the transplant or Robert's survival.  Additionally, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it hinted at potential complications or delays in the transplant process.  Overall, the paragraph is not very suspenseful and could be removed from the story without significantly impacting its overall tension.  ​

Additionally, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it hinted at potential complications or delays in the transplant process.  Overall, the paragraph is somewhat suspenseful, but it could be made more so with additional details and a focus on the stakes involved in the transplant.  ​  ​
