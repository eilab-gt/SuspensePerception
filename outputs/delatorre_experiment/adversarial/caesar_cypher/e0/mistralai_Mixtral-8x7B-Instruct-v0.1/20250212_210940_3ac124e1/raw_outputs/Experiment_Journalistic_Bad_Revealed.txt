 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension and anticipation with the description of the helicopter landing and the mention of the boy's critical condition, it lacks the specific details and unexpected twists that would make it more suspenseful.

Additionally, the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually" suggests that there were no unexpected delays or complications, which reduces the sense of urgency and suspense.
