I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of tension and urgency by describing the critical situation of the 8-year-old boy, Robert Bent, who is waiting for a liver transplant.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the arrival of the organ and the team's sense of urgency to get it to the patient as quickly as possible.
