The paragraph has a high level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a tragic outcome. The fact that the story is based on a true event adds to the tension, as does the description of the medical team's efforts to save the boy's life.

The only reason it is not a 9 is that the outcome is revealed at the end of the paragraph, which can lessen the suspense for some readers. However, the tragic nature of the event and the fact that it is a true story can still make it a very suspenseful read for many.
