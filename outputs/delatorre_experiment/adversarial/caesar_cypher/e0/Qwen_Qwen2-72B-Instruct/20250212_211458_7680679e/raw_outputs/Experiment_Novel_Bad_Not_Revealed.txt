The use of specific details, such as the location, date, and the patient's name, adds to the sense of realism and immediacy. The mention of the critical situation and the uncertainty of whether the patient will survive the wait for the organ transplant creates tension and makes the reader want to know what happens next. I would rate this paragraph a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
