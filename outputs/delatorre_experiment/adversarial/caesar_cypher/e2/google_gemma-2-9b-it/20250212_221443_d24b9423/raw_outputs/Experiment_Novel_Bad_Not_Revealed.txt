I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child's life hangs in the balance, and time is running out.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends with "This is the story of what happened," leaving the reader wanting to know the outcome.

**What's Missing:**
