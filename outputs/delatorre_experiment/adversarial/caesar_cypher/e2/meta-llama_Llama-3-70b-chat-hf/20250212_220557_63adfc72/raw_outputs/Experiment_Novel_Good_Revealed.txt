I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a potentially suspenseful situation: a critically ill boy waiting for a liver transplant, and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait. The use of specific details like the date, time, and location adds a sense of realism and raises the stakes.

However, the paragraph also gives away the outcome of the story, stating that the transplant was successful and the liver was functioning correctly. This reduces the suspense, as the reader knows that the main conflict is resolved. The phrase "This is the story of what happened" also implies that the story is more of a retrospective account rather than a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat narrative.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have ended with a cliffhanger, such as "But just as they were about to begin the surgery, disaster struck..." or "As they waited for the organ to arrive, Robert's condition began to deteriorate..." This would have left the reader wondering what would happen next and eager to continue reading.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and expectation by specifying the exact time of the helicopter's arrival, which implies that time is of the essence. The fact that Robert Bent is in a critical but stable condition adds some tension, as the reader is aware that the situation is precarious.

However, the paragraph is quite straightforward and lacks any real surprises or complications. The helicopter lands "punctually", which suggests that everything is going according to plan, and there is no sense of danger or uncertainty. The phrase "critical but stable condition" is also somewhat reassuring, implying that Robert is not in immediate danger.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have introduced some complications or obstacles, such as "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed on the roof of the hospital, but the medical team's relief was short-lived as they realized the organ was not properly packaged..." or "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ was supposed to land, but it was running 10 minutes behind schedule, and Robert's condition was deteriorating by the minute..." This would have created a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what would happen next.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a vivid and intense scene, with the rotors still turning and the men descending from the helicopter amidst the whirlwind of spinning blades. The use of sensory details like the hair blown by the wind and the inaudible shout adds to the sense of urgency and chaos.

The introduction of the blue case containing the liver raises the stakes, as the reader knows that time is of the essence and that the patient's life is hanging in the balance. The fact that the men are told that the patient is in a critical situation and they have no time to lose adds to the sense of urgency and raises the tension.

The use of body language, such as the nod and the pointing at the watch, creates a sense of silent communication and adds to the sense of urgency. The fact that the men are moving quickly and efficiently towards the exit implies that every second counts.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively straightforward scene. There are no major complications or obstacles introduced, and the men seem to be moving smoothly towards their goal. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have introduced some unexpected twist, such as the helicopter's engines failing or the men being confronted by a unexpected obstacle on the roof.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph is quite mundane and focuses on the daily routine of a cleaner in a hospital. The description of the service stairwell, the cleaner's job, and his thoughts about the corridors are all very ordinary and lack any sense of tension or suspense. The use of words like "agreeable" and "enjoyable" also contribute to a sense of calmness and normalcy.

The only potential source of suspense is the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to position the "wet floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident. However, this is not played up as a major concern, and the paragraph ends with the cleaner continuing his typical working day without any sense of drama or urgency.

Overall, the paragraph is more focused on setting a scene and establishing the cleaner's character than on creating suspense. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have introduced some unexpected event or complication, such as the cleaner discovering a mysterious object in the stairwell or hearing a strange noise that makes him feel uneasy.

The fact that the man lets go of the case to grab the bannister adds to the suspense, as the reader knows that the case contains the liver that is crucial to the patient's survival.

The phrase "the two men held their breath as they watched in horror" creates a sense of shared anxiety and raises the tension to a fever pitch.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts with a sense of relief that the case has finally stopped rolling down the stairs, but this relief is short-lived as the men realize that they don't know if the liver has been damaged. The warning "Don't!" and the decision to call the doctors creates a sense of tension and uncertainty.

The fact that the men are hesitant to touch the case and are worried about its contents adds to the suspense. The image of the two men kneeling down beside the case, looking at each other, creates a sense of shared anxiety and raises the stakes.

The decision to send one of the men to alert the medical team creates a sense of urgency and raises the tension. The use of phrases like "Without wasting any time" and "walked quickly" adds to the sense of urgency and creates a sense of momentum.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that the suspense is somewhat alleviated by the fact that the men are taking action to address the situation. The reader is still left wondering if the liver has been damaged, but the sense of panic and chaos is somewhat reduced. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have introduced additional complications or obstacles, such as the men being unable to reach the medical team or the hospital being in chaos.
