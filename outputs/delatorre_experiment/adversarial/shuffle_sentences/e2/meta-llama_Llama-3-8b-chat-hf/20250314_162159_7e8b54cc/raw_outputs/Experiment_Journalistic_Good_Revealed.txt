I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of tension and anticipation by describing the preparation for a liver transplant and the relief that the medical team feels when they verify that the transplanted liver is functioning correctly. However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of danger or uncertainty, and the sudden twist of the case falling down the stairs is somewhat predictable given the lack of a "wet floor" sign. The paragraph is more informative and descriptive than suspenseful, and it does not have a strong sense of urgency or danger that would keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
