I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph starts by describing a routine medical procedure, which sets a calm and clinical tone. The introduction of a real-life event and a specific date adds some credibility and gravity to the story, but the description of the event itself is still quite straightforward and lacks any real sense of tension or surprise. The transition to the two men leaving the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell is somewhat abrupt, but it's not clear what's supposed to be suspenseful about this moment. Overall, the paragraph doesn't create a sense of anticipation or uncertainty, which are key elements of suspense.
