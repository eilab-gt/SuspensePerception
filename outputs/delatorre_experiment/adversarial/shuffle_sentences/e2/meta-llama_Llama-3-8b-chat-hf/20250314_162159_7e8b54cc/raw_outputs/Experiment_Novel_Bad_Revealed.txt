I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by stating that the case is closed, which immediately raises questions about what happened and why it's being told. This creates some curiosity and sets the stage for the rest of the story.
* The introduction of the setting and the date creates a sense of specificity and grounding, which can make the story feel more real and urgent.
* The conversation between the two characters is brief but raises some questions. For example, what is the blue case storing? Why is it important? What is the significance of the temperature and the enzyme activity? These questions create some tension and make the reader wonder what will happen next.
* However, the paragraph doesn't have a strong sense of urgency or danger, which is a key element of suspense. The tone is more matter-of-fact and clinical, which can make the story feel more like a report or a medical procedure rather than a thrilling narrative.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of creating some curiosity and tension, but it could benefit from more dramatic language, more intense situations, and a greater sense of stakes to really ramp up the suspense.
