I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by providing a positive outcome, which reduces the sense of tension. The reader is relieved that the organ has withstood the impact and can be used for the transplant.
* The introduction of the ruptured interior bag creates a sense of concern and raises questions about what might happen next. This adds a layer of tension to the story.
* The decision of the two men to leave the roof via the service stairwell creates a sense of unease, as it's unclear what might happen to them or why they're taking this route.
* The mention of Robert's critical condition adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The reader is left wondering if Robert will survive the wait, which creates a sense of suspense.
* However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it didn't provide so much exposition upfront. The reader is told that the doctors arrived promptly, which reduces the sense of tension and makes the outcome feel more predictable.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of creating tension and suspense, but could benefit from a more subtle approach to building the story.
