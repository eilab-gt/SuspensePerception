I'd rate this paragraph a **3** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While there's a sense of urgency ("Finally, at 21:26..."), there's no immediate, clear danger presented. We don't know what might happen if the liver isn't functioning correctly, or why taking the lift is a bad idea.
* **Disjointed Narrative:** The paragraph jumps between different events (the liver transplant, the man on the stairs) without a clear connection, making it hard to build suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice ("the case rolled down the stairs") distances the reader from the action and reduces the sense of immediacy.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Establish a clear threat:** What are the consequences if the liver fails? What danger does the lift pose?
* **Connect the events:** Show how the liver transplant and the man on the stairs are related.
* **Use active voice and sensory details:**  Describe the man's pain, the sound of the case rolling, the feeling of his injured ankle.
* **End on a cliffhanger:** Leave the reader wondering what will happen next.

Here's why:

* **Implied Danger:** The sentence strongly implies that the man is about to fall, creating a sense of anticipation and potential danger.
* **Brevity:** The short, declarative sentence adds to the tension by leaving no room for explanation or reassurance.
* **Lack of Resolution:** The paragraph ends abruptly, leaving the reader hanging and wondering what will happen next.

**To increase suspense further, you could:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the man's fear, the feeling of his body tilting, the sound of his breath catching in his throat.
* **Hint at the consequences of falling:** What might happen if he falls? Is there something dangerous below him?
* **Delay the resolution:**  Stretch out the moment of falling, describing his descent in slow motion.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Multiple Threads:** The paragraph juggles several plot threads (the liver examination, the man on the stairs, the approaching people), creating a sense of mounting tension and anticipation.
* **Action and Movement:** The descriptions of the man's actions (nodding, moving, grabbing the bannister) create a sense of urgency and immediacy.
* **Unclear Outcomes:** The paragraph ends with the man letting go of the case, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next. Will the case fall? Will he be able to regain his balance?

**To increase suspense further, you could:**

* **Focus on a single thread:** Choose one of the plot threads and develop it more fully, creating a more focused and intense experience.
* **Heighten the stakes:** Make the consequences of the man's actions clearer and more dire. What will happen if the case falls?
* **Use stronger verbs and sensory details:**  Bring the scene to life with vivid descriptions of the man's fear, the sound of his footsteps, the feel of the cold metal bannister.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale.

Here's why:

* **Fragmented Narrative:** The paragraph jumps between different characters and actions (the man with the case, the medical team, the cleaner) without a clear connection, making it difficult to build sustained suspense.
* **Lack of Focus:** The paragraph touches on several potentially suspenseful elements (the damaged package, the low enzyme activity, the time pressure) but doesn't delve deeply into any of them.

**To increase suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Choose a single point of view:** Focus on the experience of one character, allowing the reader to connect with their emotions and fears.
* **Develop a clear threat:** What are the specific consequences if the liver is damaged? What will happen if the cleaner doesn't finish in time?

* **Create a sense of urgency:** Use time markers and countdown language to emphasize the ticking clock.

* **Passive Voice and Description:** The use of passive voice ("the service stairwell wasnâ€™t dirty") and detailed descriptions of the stairwell create a sense of detachment rather than suspense.
