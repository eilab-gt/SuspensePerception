I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Information Dump:** The paragraph starts with a lot of factual information that doesn't immediately create tension. We learn about the transplant's success, the real-life nature of the event, and the date. This slows down the build-up of suspense.
* **Delayed Tension:** The actual suspenseful element – Robert's critical condition and the wait for the organ – is introduced later in the paragraph.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While we know Robert's situation is critical, there's no immediate, pressing danger presented. The paragraph focuses more on setting the scene than creating a sense of urgency.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Start with the tension:** Begin with Robert's critical condition and the urgency of the situation.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe Robert's physical state, the atmosphere in the hospital, the anxiety of the medical team.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time frame before the organ arrives.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Subtly suggest that things might not go smoothly.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Introduction of a Deadline:** The mention of the helicopter landing with the organ introduces a sense of urgency and a clear deadline. We know the organ has arrived, and the clock is ticking for the transplant.
* **Contrast:** The juxtaposition of the punctual arrival with Robert's "critical but stable" condition creates a slight tension. It implies that while time is of the essence, there's still a chance for things to go wrong.
* **Brevity:** The short, concise nature of the paragraph keeps the tension focused and leaves the reader wanting more information.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the frantic activity on the roof, the anticipation in the operating room.
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** How is he feeling? Is he aware of the urgency?
* **Introduce a potential obstacle:**  Hint at something that could delay the transplant or complicate the procedure.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Introduce a complication:** Perhaps the fridge is damaged, or there's a delay in getting it to the operating room.
* **Heighten the stakes:** Emphasize the fragility of the liver or the limited time window for the transplant.
* **Show the characters' reactions:** How do the men carrying the fridge feel? Are they anxious, determined, or relieved?
