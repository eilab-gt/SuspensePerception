I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Information Dump:** The paragraph starts with a lot of factual information that doesn't immediately create tension. We learn about the transplant's success, the timeline, and the location. This slows down the pace.
* **Delayed Tension:** The suspense only starts to build towards the end with the mention of Robert's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** There's no clear and present danger established in this paragraph. The threat is implied (Robert's condition), but not actively unfolding.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Start with Robert's critical condition:**  Begin with the immediate danger to create urgency.
* **Use shorter sentences and active voice:** This creates a faster pace and a sense of immediacy.
* **Focus on sensory details:** Describe Robert's struggle, the tension in the room, the sounds of the hospital.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time Robert has before the transplant.
