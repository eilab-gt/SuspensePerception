I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph starts by creating a sense of anticipation and urgency, mentioning that a suitable donor has been found and the medical team is waiting for the organ to arrive. The use of a specific time (21:26) adds to the sense of realism and creates a sense of tension. The revelation that the organ was damaged in transit and the transplant couldn't be carried out raises the stakes and creates a sense of disappointment and worry for Robert's fate.

However, the paragraph then takes a step back and becomes more expository, providing background information about the story and setting the scene. This breaks the tension and suspense that was building up, and the reader is momentarily taken out of the story.

The final sentence, which states that what the reader is about to read is a true story, adds a sense of gravity and importance to the events that are about to unfold, but it doesn't necessarily increase the suspense.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of creating a sense of tension and urgency, but it could be more effective in sustaining that suspense throughout the entire paragraph.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of anticipation and expectation by mentioning the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ, which is a crucial element in Robert's transplant. The use of a specific time (08:57) adds to the sense of realism and creates a sense of precision.

However, the phrase "punctually on the roof of the hospital" suggests that everything is going according to plan, which reduces the sense of tension and suspense. The fact that Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" implies that he is not in immediate danger, which also reduces the sense of urgency.

Overall, the paragraph sets the scene and provides some context, but it doesn't create a strong sense of suspense or tension. The reader is not left wondering what will happen next or feeling a sense of anxiety about Robert's fate.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension from the start, with the character trying to communicate with his colleague over the noise of the helicopter blades. The use of descriptive language, such as "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and "heads down and hair blown", creates a vivid and intense atmosphere.

The introduction of the blue case containing the liver raises the stakes and creates a sense of anticipation. The fact that the liver is "fully functioning" and being stored at a precise temperature adds to the sense of importance and urgency.

The dialogue, or rather the lack of it, adds to the tension. The fact that the character's words are "inaudible" creates a sense of chaos and urgency, and the nod from the man carrying the case implies a sense of understanding and shared purpose.

The final sentence, "During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose", drives home the sense of urgency and raises the stakes even further. The reader is left feeling that every second counts, and that the characters are racing against time to save Robert's life.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is more focused on setting the scene and creating atmosphere than on creating a sense of uncertainty or unpredictability. The reader is not left wondering what will happen next or feeling a sense of doubt about the outcome. However, the paragraph is still very effective in creating a sense of tension and suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph is primarily descriptive, focusing on the mundane details of the cleaner's daily routine. The use of phrases like "like every morning" and "typical working day" creates a sense of normalcy and routine, which is the opposite of suspenseful.

The description of the service stairwell and the cleaner's tasks is detailed but uneventful, and the tone is casual and matter-of-fact. The cleaner's whistling and the fact that it's an "agreeable job" further reinforces the sense of tranquility and lack of tension.

The only potential source of suspense is the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to position the "wet floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident. However, this is not played up as a source of tension or danger, and the paragraph ends on a calm and peaceful note.

Overall, the paragraph is more focused on creating a sense of atmosphere and setting the scene than on building suspense or tension. The reader is not left feeling anxious or wondering what will happen next, and the paragraph does not create a sense of urgency or importance.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph starts by setting the scene, describing the layout of the hospital's corridors and stairwells. However, as it progresses, the focus shifts to the two characters and their conversation, which creates a sense of tension and urgency.

The mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the decision to walk down two floors instead of taking the lift creates a sense of time pressure and raises the stakes. The reader is left wondering if they will make it to the patient in time.

The dialogue between the two characters is brief but effective in creating tension. The phrase "it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors" implies a sense of urgency and importance, and the fact that the other character catches the arm of the man carrying the case suggests that something is amiss.

The final sentence, "The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm", creates a sense of sudden interruption and raises questions in the reader's mind. What is the reason for the sudden stop? Is something wrong? The reader is left wondering what will happen next, which creates a sense of suspense.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a higher rating is that the paragraph is still relatively calm and doesn't have a sense of extreme danger or risk. The tension is more subtle and builds gradually, but it's still effective in creating a sense of suspense.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph is extremely effective in creating a sense of tension and suspense. The description of the man's foot slipping and his attempt to recover his balance creates a sense of sudden danger and instability. The image of the case rolling down the stairs, making a noise like "a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag", is vivid and unsettling, and the fact that the two men are holding their breath in horror adds to the sense of tension.

The use of phrases like "he couldn't stay upright" and "he managed to hold on" creates a sense of precariousness and raises the stakes. The reader is left wondering if the man will be able to recover and if the case will be damaged.

The second part of the paragraph, where the man's foot slips again and he lets go of the case, is even more suspenseful. The use of phrases like "without thinking" and "to stop himself from falling" creates a sense of urgency and panic, and the fact that the man lets go of the case raises the stakes even further. The reader is left wondering what will happen to the case and the liver it contains.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is relatively short and the suspense is resolved quickly. The reader is not left in a state of suspense for a long period of time, and the paragraph does not create a sense of long-term tension or uncertainty. However, the paragraph is still extremely effective in creating a sense of sudden danger and suspense.

I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph starts with a sense of tension and suspense, as the two men are dealing with the aftermath of the case rolling down the stairs. The dialogue between them is brief but effective in creating a sense of urgency and concern. The phrase "It's best to call the doctors" implies that something is seriously wrong, and the warning "Don't!" suggests that the situation is precarious.

However, as the paragraph progresses, the sense of suspense starts to dissipate. The description of the man going down the stairs and through the door into the hospital is relatively mundane and doesn't create a sense of tension or danger. The fact that the case finally reaches the bottom and stops is a relief, but it doesn't create a sense of suspense or uncertainty.

The paragraph is more focused on resolving the immediate crisis and setting the scene for what happens next, rather than creating a sense of long-term tension or suspense. The reader is not left wondering what will happen next or feeling a sense of anxiety about the outcome. Overall, the paragraph is more of a transition or a setup for the next scene, rather than a suspenseful moment in its own right.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph is extremely effective in creating a sense of tension and suspense. The description of the colleague standing still, holding onto the bannister, creates a sense of frozen anxiety. The mention of the doctors rushing up the service stairwell adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

The inner monologue of the character, where he's trying not to think about the possibility of the liver being damaged, creates a sense of psychological tension and raises the reader's anxiety levels. The fact that he's standing on his injured foot, bearing weight on it, adds to the sense of physical discomfort and pain.

The dialogue between the doctor and the character, "Move away, please", is brief but effective in creating a sense of authority and urgency. The fact that the doctor is kneeling down next to the case implies that something serious is happening, and the reader is left wondering what the outcome will be.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 9 out of 9 is that the paragraph is relatively slow-burning, and the suspense builds gradually. There are no sudden shocks or surprises, and the tension is more psychological and emotional than sudden and dramatic. However, the paragraph is still extremely effective in creating a sense of suspense and tension, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph is masterfully crafted to create a sense of suspense and tension. The brief look by the doctor, followed by a shake of his head, implies that something is seriously wrong, and the reader is left wondering what the doctor has seen.

The description of the outer case opening to reveal a small padded fridge is a clever way to build suspense, as the reader is not sure what to expect. The revelation that the fridge has ruptured and is leaking refrigerated air creates a sense of shock and raises the stakes.

The use of words like "ruptured" and "split" creates a sense of violence and damage, and the image of the thin stream of air escaping is a powerful and evocative one. The reader is left wondering if the liver is still viable, and the sense of tension and suspense is palpable.

The final sentence, "He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs", is a masterstroke. The click is a small, seemingly insignificant sound, but it takes on a huge significance in the context of the story. The reader is left wondering what the click means, and whether it's a sign of hope or despair.

Overall, the paragraph is a perfect example of how to build suspense through careful pacing, evocative language, and clever plot reveals. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness.

The paragraph is incredibly suspenseful, with a sense of tension and urgency that permeates every sentence. The description of the surgeon's gloved hands guiding a small syringe to the liver creates a sense of precision and delicacy, and the fact that everyone else in the laboratory is moving back to give him space adds to the sense of importance and gravity.

The phrase "If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably" is a masterstroke, as it raises the stakes to an almost unbearable level. The reader is left wondering if the surgeon will be able to perform the biopsy successfully, and the sense of tension is palpable.

The fact that the surgeon is feeling nervous, despite having carried out numerous biopsies before, adds to the sense of uncertainty and raises the stakes even further. The phrase "a child's life was hanging in the balance" is a powerful reminder of the consequences of failure, and the reader is left feeling anxious and invested in the outcome.

The final sentence, "Everything depended on the metabolic rate", is a perfect cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next and whether the biopsy will be successful. Overall, the paragraph is a masterclass in building suspense and tension, and the reader is left on the edge of their seat, desperate to know what happens next.
