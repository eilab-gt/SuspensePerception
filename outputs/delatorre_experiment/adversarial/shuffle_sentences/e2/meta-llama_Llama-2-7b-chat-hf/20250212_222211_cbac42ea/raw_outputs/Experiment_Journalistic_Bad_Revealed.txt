  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

1. The paragraph starts with a hook by introducing a real event that took place in a well-known hospital, which creates a sense of authenticity and intrigue.
2. The story is centered around a critical medical procedure (liver transplant) and a young patient (Robert Bent) who is in a life-threatening situation, which creates a sense of urgency and tension.
3. The paragraph sets up the expectation that something dramatic is about to happen, as the medical team is ready for the transplant and the donor organ is on its way, but the paragraph then takes a surprising turn by revealing that the organ sustained damage in transit and Robert's situation is critical.
4. The use of time markers (8 a.m., 21:26) creates a sense of temporal pressure and adds to the suspense.
5. The uncertainty around Robert's survival adds to the tension, as the reader is left wondering if he will make it through the wait.

However, there are a few elements that keep it from being a 9 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness:

1. The paragraph is quite short, which means that the suspense is not built up over a long period of time.
2. The language used is relatively straightforward and does not use any particularly evocative or descriptive language that would heighten the suspense.
3. The story is based on a real event, which means that the outcome is already known, which reduces the suspense to some extent.

Overall, while the paragraph is suspenseful, it could be even more effective in building tension and creating a sense of uncertainty if it were longer, used more descriptive language, and had a more unpredictable outcome.
