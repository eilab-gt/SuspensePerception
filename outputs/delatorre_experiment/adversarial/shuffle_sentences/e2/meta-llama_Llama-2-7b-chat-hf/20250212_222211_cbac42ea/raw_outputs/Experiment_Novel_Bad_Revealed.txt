  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 out of 9 in terms of suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets up a clear conflict and stakes from the beginning, with the medical team finding a suitable donor for a liver transplant and the recipient's critical condition. The use of time constraints, with the organ arriving at 21:26 and the recipient's situation being critical, adds to the tension. However, the paragraph also provides some information that reduces the suspense slightly, such as the fact that the event occurred in a real hospital and on a specific date.

Overall, the paragraph has a good balance of suspense and information, but it could be more suspenseful if the author had left some questions unanswered or provided more clues about the outcome.

The paragraph introduces a new element of the service stairwell leading to a secondary corridor and the east wing lift, which creates a sense of possibility and potential danger. The mention of the helipad exit being under cover and the corridor housing central archives, the main storeroom, and rooms reserved for doctors and residents adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue.
