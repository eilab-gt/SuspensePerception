I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph builds tension by introducing a critical situation (a liver transplant) and a potential disaster (the case containing the organ falling down the stairs). The specific details, like the timing and the cleaner forgetting the "wet floor" sign, add to the sense of urgency and unpredictability. The stakes are high, as a young boy's life depends on the success of the transplant.

- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the opening sentence, which reveals that the liver ultimately functions correctly. This spoils the outcome and reduces the tension. Additionally, the paragraph could benefit from more vivid descriptions or emotional depth to heighten the reader's investment in the situation.

Overall, it’s suspenseful but could be more so if the outcome were left uncertain.
