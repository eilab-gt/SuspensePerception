I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening line "He closed the case" and the mention of a real event create a sense of mystery and potential danger.
* **High Stakes:** The context of a liver transplant and the urgency implied by the time constraints ("it'll have taken longer than walking down two floors") raise the stakes.
* **Lack of Clear Threat:**  While there's a sense of urgency, the paragraph doesn't establish a clear and present threat. We don't know what could go wrong or who is in danger.
* **Neutral Tone:** The language is mostly factual and descriptive, lacking the emotional intensity or ominous foreshadowing that would heighten suspense.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce a conflict or obstacle:** Perhaps the liver is malfunctioning, or there's a problem with the transport.
* **Focus on the emotional state of the characters:**  Show their anxiety, fear, or determination.
* **Use more vivid and evocative language:**  Create a sense of tension and anticipation through word choice and imagery.
