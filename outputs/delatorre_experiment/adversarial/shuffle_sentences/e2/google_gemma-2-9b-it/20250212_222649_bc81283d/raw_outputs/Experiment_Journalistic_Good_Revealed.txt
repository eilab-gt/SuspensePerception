I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines about the liver transplant and the critical situation create immediate interest. 
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of "awaiting the arrival of the organ" and "Robert would survive the wait"  introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Clear Threat:** While we know Robert is in danger, the paragraph doesn't explicitly state what the threat is beyond the need for a transplant. This lack of a concrete danger makes the suspense less intense.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph relies heavily on telling us about the situation ("Robert's situation was critical," "they were not sure if he would survive") rather than showing us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations.
* **Highlight the medical team's anxieties:** Show their internal struggles and the weight of the decision.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Make the time pressure more tangible with specific deadlines or events.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Subtly suggest that the transplant might not go smoothly.
