I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a somber tone with the news that the liver has not withstood the impact and cannot be used for the transplant. This creates a sense of tension and raises questions about what will happen next.
* The introduction of the two men leaving the roof via the service stairwell creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what they are doing and why.
* The arrival of the helicopter and the doctors creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen to Robert Bent.
* However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of danger or immediate threat, which is what typically drives suspense. The situation is critical, but it's not clear what the consequences will be or what will happen next.

Overall, the paragraph creates a sense of tension and anticipation, but it's not as suspenseful as it could be.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts with a sudden and unexpected event: the man slipping and the case falling down the stairs. This creates a sense of shock and surprise, which grabs the reader's attention.

* The paragraph is short and to the point, which makes it feel more intense and suspenseful. It doesn't have any unnecessary details or distractions, which allows the reader to focus on the action and the suspense.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that it's a relatively simple and straightforward event. There's no complex plot or character development, and the suspense is mainly driven by the sudden and unexpected nature of the event. However, it's still a very effective and suspenseful paragraph that grabs the reader's attention and makes them want to keep reading.
