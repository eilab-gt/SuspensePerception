I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts with a sense of tension and urgency, as the men are watching the case being carried away with a sense of horror. This creates a sense of unease and curiosity.
* The description of the case making a noise like loose keys being shaken in a bag is an effective way to build tension and create a sense of unease.
* The mention of the metabolic rate and the fact that the organ has not been damaged by the impact adds a sense of relief, which is a good contrast to the tension that has been built up.
* The description of the fridge rupturing and the stream of refrigerated air escaping adds a sense of danger and uncertainty, which keeps the reader engaged.
* However, the paragraph is somewhat lacking in terms of plot progression and surprises. The story is told in a fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact way, which reduces the suspensefulness.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of unease, but it could be more effective with more plot twists and surprises to keep the reader engaged.
