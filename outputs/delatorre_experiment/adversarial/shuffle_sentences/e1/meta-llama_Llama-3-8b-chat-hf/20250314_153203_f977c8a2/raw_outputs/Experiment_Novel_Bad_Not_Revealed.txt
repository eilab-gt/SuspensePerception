I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts by setting a somewhat ominous tone with the phrase "a child's life was hanging in the balance", which creates a sense of tension and urgency.

* The mention of the cleaner finishing their task in the service stairwell is somewhat out of place and creates a sense of unease, as it implies that something might be about to go wrong.

However, the paragraph doesn't quite reach the level of suspensefulness that a 9 would require. The tone is more clinical and matter-of-fact, and the events described are more procedural than dramatic. The paragraph doesn't create a strong sense of tension or uncertainty, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next. Overall, it's a solid paragraph, but it could benefit from more dramatic language and a greater sense of urgency to elevate its suspensefulness.
