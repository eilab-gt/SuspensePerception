I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The paragraph starts with a sense of relief (the liver functioning) and then immediately shifts to a sense of urgency ("Robert would survive the wait"). This creates a hook.
* **High Stakes:**  We're told Robert's situation is critical, and the transplant is imminent. This establishes high stakes.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:**  While the situation is tense, there isn't a clear and present danger described in this paragraph. We don't know what specifically threatens Robert's survival.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph relies heavily on telling us about the situation ("Robert's situation was critical") rather than showing us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Introduce a specific threat:**  Is there a complication with the transplant? Is there a time limit?
* **Show, don't tell:**  Describe Robert's physical state, the medical team's anxiety, or the ticking clock.
* **Create a sense of mystery:**  Hint at something unknown or unexpected that might happen.

Here's why:

I'd rate this paragraph a **3/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While the paragraph describes a specific location and route, there's no sense of immediate danger or urgency.

* **Missed Opportunities:** The paragraph mentions the "central archives" and "rooms reserved for doctors and residents," which could be intriguing elements to explore for suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

I'd rate this paragraph a **7/9** on the suspensefulness scale.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Resolution, Not Suspense:** This paragraph provides a resolution to the story rather than building suspense. We know the liver is functioning correctly, so there's no sense of uncertainty or danger.

* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph tells us the liver is functioning correctly, but it doesn't show us through any vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on the Moment:** Instead of stating the outcome, describe the scene as the medical team verifies the liver's function. Show their expressions, their actions, and the atmosphere in the room.
* **Hint at Potential Complications:** Even though the liver is functioning, you could hint at potential future challenges or complications to keep the reader engaged.
* **Connect to the Characters:**  Show how the news affects Robert, his family, or the medical team.
