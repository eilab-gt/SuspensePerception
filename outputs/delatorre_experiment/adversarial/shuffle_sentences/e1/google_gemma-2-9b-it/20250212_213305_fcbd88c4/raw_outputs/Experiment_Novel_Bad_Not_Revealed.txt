I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:** The setup of a critical liver transplant with a ticking clock immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:**  The phrase "Robert would survive the wait" clearly establishes the danger and raises the stakes.
* **Real-Event Claim:**  The mention of a real event adds a layer of authenticity and potential emotional weight.

**However:**

* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** The paragraph focuses on the preparation and uncertainty rather than a direct, immediate threat. 
* **Telling, Not Showing:**  We're *told* Robert's situation is critical, but we don't see any concrete details or sensory descriptions that make it feel truly urgent.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Introduce a specific obstacle or complication.**
* **Use more vivid language to describe Robert's condition.**
* **Hint at a potential conflict or unexpected turn of events.**

I'd rate this paragraph a **5 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Ticking Clock:** The specific time (08:57) reinforces the sense of urgency and impending action.
* **High Stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition, making the arrival of the organ crucial.
* **Unexpected Element:** The helicopter landing adds a touch of drama and visual interest.

**However:**

* **Lack of Emotional Connection:** We don't get a strong sense of Robert's emotional state or the tension felt by the medical team.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of "was in a critical but stable condition" feels somewhat detached and less impactful than a more active description.


To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating Robert's condition, describe his physical symptoms or the worried expressions of those around him.
* **Focus on the anticipation:**  Describe the team's nervous energy, the hushed whispers, or the frantic preparations as they await the organ.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Introduce a small detail that suggests something might go wrong, even if it's just a minor delay or a technical issue.

I'd rate this paragraph a **7 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Heightened Action:** The arrival of the men, the urgency of their movements, and the focus on the blue case create a sense of immediacy and purpose.
* **Sensory Details:** The description of the rotors, the wind, and the inaudible shouts immerses the reader in the scene and adds to the tension.

**What makes it work well:**

* **Show, don't tell:** We see the men's actions and hear the sounds, rather than just being told about the urgency.
* **Focus on the object:** The blue case becomes a symbol of hope and life, adding emotional weight to the scene.

**To make it even more suspenseful:**

* **Introduce a potential obstacle:** Perhaps there's a sudden gust of wind, a technical issue with the case, or a moment of hesitation from one of the men.
* **Heighten the emotional stakes:**  Give us a glimpse into the thoughts or feelings of the men, or perhaps a brief moment of doubt or fear.

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a clear resolution to the story, stating that the transplant was unsuccessful and Robert Bent died. This removes a lot of the suspense that was built up in previous paragraphs.

* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph simply states the facts without using vivid language or sensory details to engage the reader emotionally.

**To make it more suspenseful:**
