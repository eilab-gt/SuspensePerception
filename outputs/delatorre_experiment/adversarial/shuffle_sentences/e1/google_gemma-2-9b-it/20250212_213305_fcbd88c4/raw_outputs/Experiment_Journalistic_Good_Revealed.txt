I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:** The opening lines about the liver transplant and the critical situation create immediate interest. 
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of "awaiting the arrival of the organ" and the fact that Robert's situation was critical adds a sense of urgency.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:**  While the situation is serious, the paragraph doesn't present a clear and present danger. We know Robert is in trouble, but we don't see a specific threat unfolding.
* **Telling, Not Showing:** The paragraph relies heavily on telling us about Robert's condition and the situation rather than showing us through vivid descriptions or actions.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's perspective:**  Describe his feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:**  Give a more concrete deadline or a specific event that must happen.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Subtly suggest that the transplant might not go smoothly.
* **Use sensory details:**  Describe the hospital environment, the sounds, smells, and sights to create a more immersive experience.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Element:** The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ is a significant event that immediately grabs attention.
* **Time Specificity:**  The precise time (08:57) adds a sense of urgency and builds anticipation.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on Robert's reaction:**  Describe his hope, fear, or anxiety as he awaits the organ.
* **Introduce a potential problem:**  Hint at a delay, a complication, or a risk associated with the transplant.
