I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Elements of Suspense:**
    * **High Stakes:** The child's life is in the balance, immediately raising the tension.
    * **Urgency:**  Phrases like "urgently transferred" and "just a few minutes earlier" create a sense of time pressure.
    * **Mystery:** We don't know the nature of the enzyme activity problem or the child's condition, leaving room for speculation.

* **Reasons it's not higher:**
    * **Lack of Direct Threat:** There's no immediate, tangible danger presented to the characters. The suspense is more about the unknown outcome.
    * **Unclear Connection:** The cleaner mopping the floor feels disconnected from the main plot and doesn't contribute significantly to the suspense.

**To increase the suspense:**

* **Focus on the doctor's internal struggle:**  Show his anxiety, fear, or determination.
* **Hint at a potential complication:**  Perhaps the cleaner accidentally dropped something important, or there's a delay in the transplant process.
* **Build a sense of foreboding:** Use sensory details to create a tense atmosphere.
