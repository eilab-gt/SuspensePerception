I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph builds tension by detailing a critical moment in a life-or-death situation. The description of the cleaner not displaying the "wet floor" sign and the subsequent slip creates a sense of impending danger. The stakes are high, as the liver transplant is crucial for Robert Bent's survival, and the damage to the organ in transit adds to the suspense.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the opening sentence, which reveals that the liver was ultimately functioning correctly. This spoils the tension by letting the reader know the outcome upfront. Additionally, the paragraph could benefit from more vivid language or pacing to heighten the sense of urgency.

Overall, itâ€™s suspenseful but could be more so with a different structure or more dramatic storytelling.
