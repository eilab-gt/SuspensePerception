The paragraph has some elements of suspense, particularly in the mention of a child's life hanging in the balance and the urgency of the medical situation. However, the language and focus on procedural details may detract from the suspense for some readers. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. The suspense is there, but it's not as gripping or emotionally charged as it could be. The mention of the cleaner mopping the floor at the end seems out of place and does not contribute to the suspense.
