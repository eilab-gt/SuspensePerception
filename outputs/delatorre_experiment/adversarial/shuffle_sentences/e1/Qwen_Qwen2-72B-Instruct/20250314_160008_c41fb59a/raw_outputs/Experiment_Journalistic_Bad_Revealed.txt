The paragraph has some elements of suspense, particularly when it mentions the biopsy and the uncertainty about the condition of the organ. However, the suspense is somewhat diminished by the straightforward, clinical language and the lack of any immediate threat or tension. The fact that the story is based on a real event could add to the suspense for some readers. Overall, I would rate the paragraph as a 4 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. It has some suspenseful elements, but they are not particularly strong or sustained. 

However, if the question is to rate the suspensefulness of the paragraph as it is written, without any additional context or information, then the rating would be lower, perhaps a 2 or 3. The paragraph does not build tension or create a sense of uncertainty or danger, which are key elements of suspense. Instead, it presents a series of factual statements about a medical procedure and the outcome of that procedure. While the outcome may be disappointing or tragic for the patient and their family, it is not inherently suspenseful. 

Therefore, my final rating for the paragraph's suspensefulness, based on the criteria provided, is a 3. It has some elements of suspense, but they are not particularly strong or sustained, and the overall tone and style of the paragraph do not create a sense of tension or uncertainty.
