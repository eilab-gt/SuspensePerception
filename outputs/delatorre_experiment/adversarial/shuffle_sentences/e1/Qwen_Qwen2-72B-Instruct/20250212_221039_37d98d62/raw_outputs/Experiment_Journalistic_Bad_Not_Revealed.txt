The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a young boy awaiting a life-saving transplant and the uncertainty of whether he will survive the wait. The fact that it is a true story also adds to the tension. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it included more details about the boy's condition, the urgency of the situation, and the potential consequences of the transplant failing. It could also benefit from more vivid language and sensory details to create a more immersive and emotionally engaging experience for the reader. Without these elements, the paragraph feels somewhat clinical and detached, which can detract from the suspense. 

Revised rating: 6/9.
