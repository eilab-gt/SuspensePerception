The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a ticking clock element (the wait for the organ) and the uncertainty of whether the patient will survive. The use of specific details, such as the patient's name and the hospital where the event took place, adds to the sense of realism and urgency. However, the paragraph does not contain any major plot twists or cliffhangers, so the suspense is more of a steady build rather than a sudden spike. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale.

The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it continues the story of Robert Bent's critical condition and the arrival of the organ that could save his life. The use of a specific time (08:57) and the detail of the helicopter landing on the hospital roof create a sense of immediacy and urgency. However, the paragraph does not contain any major plot twists or cliffhangers, and the fact that the helicopter landed "punctually" suggests that the situation is under control, which may lessen the suspense. I would rate it a 5 on the 9-point scale.

However, it does not introduce any new elements of danger, uncertainty, or tension. The straightforward description of the two men descending from the helicopter and the liver being stored in a fridge does not create a sense of urgency or immediate danger. I would rate it a 3 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph is informative but does not significantly build suspense.

The paragraph introduces an element of potential danger and uncertainty, which can create suspense. The detail about the cleaner not displaying the "wet floor" sign suggests that there might be an accident or a complication, especially in the context of a critical medical situation. This creates a sense of looming danger, as the wet floor could potentially cause a delay or an issue with the organ transplant process. I would rate it a 6 on the 9-point scale. The suspense is moderate because the paragraph hints at a possible problem that could arise from the oversight, but it does not provide enough information to know the full implications or outcome.

The paragraph has a moderate to low level of suspense. It resolves the uncertainty created by the previous events by revealing that the organ has withstood the impact and can still be used for the transplant. This information relieves the tension that was built up around the condition of the liver. However, the fact that the organ is still viable does not completely eliminate suspense, as the transplant itself still needs to be carried out successfully. I would rate it a 3 on the 9-point scale. The suspense is reduced because the paragraph provides a positive outcome to the immediate concern, but there is still a level of anticipation for the final outcome of the transplant.
