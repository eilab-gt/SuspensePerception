The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a ticking clock and the life of a young boy hanging in the balance. The fact that the organ was damaged in transit adds an unexpected twist and raises the stakes even higher. The uncertainty of whether the boy will survive the wait adds to the tension. However, the paragraph also includes some expository information that detracts from the suspense, such as the fact that the story is based on a real event and the specific date and location. Overall, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
