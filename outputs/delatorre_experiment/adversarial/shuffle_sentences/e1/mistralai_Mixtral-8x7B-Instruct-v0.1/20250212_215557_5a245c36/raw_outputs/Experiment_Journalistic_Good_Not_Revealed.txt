 I would rate the paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension through the use of time-sensitive details, such as the ticking clock of the eight-hour wait for the organ donation and the critical condition of the young patient, Robert Bent. The real-life setting and date also add to the sense of immediacy and importance.
