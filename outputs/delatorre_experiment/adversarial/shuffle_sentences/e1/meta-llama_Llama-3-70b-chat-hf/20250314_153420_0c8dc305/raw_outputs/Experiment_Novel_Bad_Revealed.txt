I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph starts by stating that what's about to be read is a true story, which could potentially create some tension, but it's quickly deflated by the mundane details that follow. The story seems to be building up to a medical procedure, but the tone is very matter-of-fact and lacks any sense of urgency or danger. The characters' actions and dialogue are also very ordinary and don't convey any sense of tension or suspense. The only slightly intriguing element is the mention of the liver being stored in a blue case, but it's not enough to create a sense of suspense. Overall, the paragraph feels more like a setup for a medical procedural than a suspenseful story.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for suspensefulness. This paragraph is extremely mundane and lacks any sense of tension or suspense. The description of the service stairwell and the habits of the staff is dry and uneventful, and there is no hint of anything unusual or threatening. The paragraph feels like a piece of background information or a descriptive passage, but it doesn't contribute to building suspense or tension in any way. It's a very neutral and unremarkable paragraph.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph starts by creating some tension with the phrase "Everything depended on the metabolic rate", which implies that something important is at stake. The description of the medical team's actions and the certification of Robert Bent's death adds to the sense of gravity and seriousness. The introduction of the helicopter and the two men descending from it creates a sense of sudden and dramatic action.

However, the paragraph then takes a unexpected turn with the introduction of the janitor character, who seems out of place in the midst of the medical drama. The description of him whistling and working his way up the stairs with a mop and bucket creates a sense of incongruity and unease, which adds to the suspense.

The lack of a clear connection between the medical drama and the janitor's actions creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind, which contributes to the suspense. Overall, the paragraph is suspenseful, but it's a slow-burning suspense that builds through the accumulation of details rather than a sudden, shocking event.
