I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Information Dump:** The paragraph starts with a lot of factual information that doesn't immediately create tension. We learn about the transplant's success, the real-life nature of the event, and the date. This slows down the build-up of suspense.
* **Delayed Tension:** The actual suspenseful element – Robert's critical condition and the wait for the organ – is introduced later in the paragraph.
* **Lack of Immediate Threat:** While we know Robert's situation is critical, there's no immediate, pressing danger presented. The paragraph focuses more on setting the scene than creating a sense of urgency.

**To improve the suspense:**

* **Start with the tension:** Begin with Robert's critical condition and the urgency of the situation.
* **Use sensory details:** Describe Robert's physical state, the atmosphere in the hospital, the anxiety of the medical team.
* **Introduce a ticking clock:** Emphasize the limited time frame for the transplant.
* **Hint at potential complications:**  Subtly suggest that things might not go smoothly.

**To increase suspense:**

* **Add sensory details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the tension in the hospital, the reactions of the medical team.
