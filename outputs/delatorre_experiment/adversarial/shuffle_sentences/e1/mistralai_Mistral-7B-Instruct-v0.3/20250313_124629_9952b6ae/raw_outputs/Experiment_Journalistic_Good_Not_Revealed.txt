This paragraph creates a moderate level of suspense due to the following reasons:

1. The action of one colleague going to warn the doctors creates a sense of urgency, as it suggests that something important is happening.
2. The fact that the liver is not handled until the doctors arrive adds a sense of caution and care, as it suggests that the organ is fragile and needs to be treated carefully.
