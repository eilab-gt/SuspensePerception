 I would rate the paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some resolution to the cliffhanger from the previous paragraph, it does not add much new suspense or tension.

However, the fact that Robert is still in a critical but stable condition leaves some room for uncertainty and anticipation. Overall, the paragraph is somewhat suspenseful, but it could benefit from more development to further heighten the tension.

  I would rate the paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph focuses on the mundane and routine activities of a hospital cleaner, which does not contribute to the suspense or tension of the story. While the description of the service stairwell and the cleaner's routine provides some context for the story, it does not add any new suspenseful elements or cliffhangers.
