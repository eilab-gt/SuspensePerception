 I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively builds tension by describing the urgent situation and the long wait for a liver transplant, only to reveal that the organ arrived too late and the boy died. The use of specific details, such as the exact time of the boy's death and the fact that a suitable donor had been found just the day before, adds to the suspense and makes the story feel more real and immediate. However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it provided more information about the boy's condition and the risks and challenges of the transplant, or if it hinted at some unexpected twist or turn in the story.
