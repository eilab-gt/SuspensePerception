I would rate this paragraph a **7** for suspensefulness. Here's why:

- **Strengths**: The paragraph builds tension by detailing a critical moment in a life-saving procedure. The mention of the liver being damaged in transit, the cleaner's oversight, and the case plunging down the stairs all create a sense of urgency and unpredictability. The timeline and specific details add to the realism and stakes.
  
- **Weaknesses**: The suspense is somewhat diminished by the opening sentence, which reveals that the liver ultimately functioned correctly. This reduces the uncertainty about the outcome. Additionally, the paragraph could benefit from more vivid descriptions or emotional depth to heighten the tension further.

Overall, it’s quite suspenseful but could be even more gripping with a few adjustments.
