I would rate this paragraph a **4** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and needs the transplant to survive. This creates some tension.
* **It hints at potential danger:** The phrase "they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait" adds a sense of uncertainty and worry.
* **It lacks immediate action:** The paragraph mostly sets the scene and background information. There's no immediate threat or cliffhanger to hook the reader.
* **The real-life context:** Mentioning it's a true story can pique interest, but it doesn't inherently make the paragraph suspenseful.

To increase suspense, the paragraph could:

* **Start with a more immediate, action-packed scene.**
* **Introduce a ticking clock element.**
* **Tease a potential complication or obstacle.**

Here's why:

* **It introduces a sense of urgency:** The precise time (08:57) and the mention of a helicopter landing create a feeling of immediacy and importance.
* **It contrasts Robert's condition:**  The phrase "critical but stable condition" adds a layer of tension. While he's not actively deteriorating, his situation is still precarious.

* **It creates anticipation:** We know someone is about to enter the stairwell, and we're left wondering if they'll slip and fall.
