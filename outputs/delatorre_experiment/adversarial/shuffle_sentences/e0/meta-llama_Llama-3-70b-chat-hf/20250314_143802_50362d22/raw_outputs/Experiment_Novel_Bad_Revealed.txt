I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph starts by stating that what's about to be read is a true story, which could potentially create some tension, but it's quickly deflated by the mundane details that follow. The story seems to be building up to a medical procedure, but the tone is very matter-of-fact and lacks any sense of urgency or danger. The characters' actions and dialogue are also very ordinary and don't convey any sense of tension or suspense. The only slightly intriguing element is the mention of the liver being stored in a blue case, but it's not enough to create a sense of suspense. Overall, the paragraph feels more like a setup for a medical procedural than a suspenseful story.
