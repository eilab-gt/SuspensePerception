I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts by setting up a sense of anticipation and urgency, mentioning that a suitable donor has been found and the medical team is waiting for the organ to arrive. The use of a specific time (21:26) adds to the sense of tension. The revelation that the organ was damaged in transit and the transplant couldn't be carried out creates a sense of disappointment and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder if Robert will survive.

However, the paragraph then takes a step back and becomes more expository, providing background information about the story and setting the scene. This breaks the tension and suspense that was building up. The final sentence, which informs the reader that what they're about to read is a true story, is more of a framing device than a suspense-building element.

Overall, the paragraph has some effective suspense-building elements, but they're not sustained throughout the entire paragraph. With some further refinement to maintain the tension and suspense, this could be an even more gripping opening.

I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph sets a specific time (08:57) and creates a sense of anticipation by mentioning the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ. The use of the word "punctually" implies that time is of the essence, which adds to the sense of urgency.

However, the phrase "critical but stable condition" somewhat tempers the suspense. The word "stable" suggests that Robert's condition is not deteriorating, which reduces the sense of immediate danger. Additionally, the paragraph is quite short and lacks any real surprises or twists, which limits its suspensefulness.

Overall, while the paragraph has some elements that contribute to suspense, it's a relatively straightforward and factual description of an event, which limits its ability to build tension and keep the reader on the edge of their seat.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension from the start, with the character trying to communicate with his colleague over the noise of the helicopter blades. The use of gestures (touching the shoulder, pointing at the watch and doorway) adds to the sense of immediacy and importance.

The description of the two men descending from the helicopter, with their heads down and hair blown by the wind, creates a vivid and intense image. The fact that one of them is clutching a blue case containing the liver adds to the sense of anticipation and raises the stakes.

The inaudible shout and the visible nod between the two men creates a sense of mystery and adds to the tension. The phrase "they had no time to lose" explicitly states the urgency of the situation, and the fact that the patient is in a critical situation raises the emotional stakes.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively straightforward description of events. There are no major twists or surprises, and the outcome is still somewhat predictable. However, the paragraph does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of urgency, making it very suspenseful.

I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is a descriptive passage that focuses on the mundane daily routine of a hospital cleaner. The text is heavy on details about the cleaner's tasks, the layout of the hospital, and the cleaner's thoughts and feelings. While the description is vivid and immersive, it's also very calm and peaceful.

There's no sense of urgency, danger, or tension in this paragraph. The cleaner is whistling and enjoying his work, and the tone is overall very relaxed. The passage is more focused on creating a sense of atmosphere and setting than on building suspense.

The only potential element of suspense is the fact that the cleaner doesn't bother to put up "wet floor" warning signs, which could potentially lead to an accident. However, this is not played up as a source of tension or danger, and the paragraph ends on a very calm and ordinary note.

Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful at all, and is instead focused on creating a sense of everyday normalcy.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts by setting a sense of location and atmosphere, describing the service stairwell and the corridor leading to the east wing lift. The mention of the helipad exit and the metal ramp adds a sense of urgency and importance to the scene.

The dialogue between the two characters creates a sense of tension and raises the stakes. The fact that the patient is on the 6th floor and they need to get there quickly adds to the sense of urgency. The decision to walk down two floors instead of taking the lift creates a sense of immediacy and raises the tension.

The moment when the man carrying the case goes to enter the corridor, but is caught by the other, is a turning point in the paragraph. It creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "What's wrong?" or "What's going to happen next?" This moment of hesitation and uncertainty adds to the suspense.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively slow-burning build-up of tension. The stakes are high, but the action is still relatively mundane (walking down stairs, entering a corridor). The paragraph is setting the stage for something more dramatic to happen, but it hasn't quite reached that point yet.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

This paragraph is a masterclass in building tension and suspense. The scene is set with a sense of precariousness, as the man's foot is already raised and he's struggling to stay upright. The use of the phrase "he couldn't stay upright" creates a sense of inevitability, and the reader knows that something bad is about to happen.

The moment when the case rolls down the stairs is a heart-stopping moment, and the description of the noise it makes ("a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag") is vivid and evocative. The fact that the two men are holding their breath and watching in horror adds to the sense of tension and raises the stakes.

But the real kicker is the second part of the paragraph, where the man's foot slips and he twists his ankle. The use of the phrase "without thinking" creates a sense of panic and desperation, and the fact that he lets go of the case to grab the bannister is a moment of pure suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to the case, and whether the man will be able to recover from his mistake.

The paragraph is expertly paced, with a slow build-up of tension followed by a series of rapid-fire events that create a sense of chaos and urgency. The language is vivid and evocative, and the reader is fully invested in the scene. Overall, this paragraph is a textbook example of how to create suspense in writing.

I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts with a sense of relief, as the crisis of the case rolling down the stairs seems to have been averted. The man's decision to stay and watch the case, while the other goes to alert the medical team, creates a sense of caution and responsibility.

However, the tension is quickly ramped up again as the two men kneel down beside the case, looking at each other with concern. The decision to call the doctors adds to the sense of urgency, and the warning not to touch the case because it might be damaged creates a sense of uncertainty and risk.

The paragraph then takes a bit of a breather, as the man goes down the stairs and through the door into the hospital. The pace of the paragraph slows down, and the tension is somewhat released.

While the paragraph is still engaging and well-written, it doesn't quite reach the same level of suspense as the previous paragraph. The stakes are still high, but the action is more procedural and less chaotic. The paragraph is setting the stage for the next development in the story, but it's not quite as intense or suspenseful as the previous section.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts with a sense of tension, as the colleague is frozen in place, holding onto the bannister. The introduction of the doctors rushing up the service stairwell adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

The description of the man's thoughts, as he tries to distract himself from the possibility that the liver has been damaged, creates a sense of anxiety and uncertainty. The fact that he's standing beside the case, trying not to think about the worst-case scenario, adds to the tension.

The arrival of the doctors and the request to move away creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "What will they find?" or "Is the liver still usable?" The fact that the man is injured and in pain adds to the sense of drama and raises the emotional stakes.

The only thing that keeps this paragraph from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's a relatively slow-burning build-up of tension. The action is more procedural, with the doctors arriving and examining the case, rather than a fast-paced and chaotic sequence of events. However, the paragraph is still very suspenseful, and the reader is fully invested in the outcome.

I would rate this paragraph a 9 out of 9 for suspensefulness. Here's why:

The paragraph starts with a sense of anticipation, as the doctor examines the case and then turns to those watching, shaking his head. This creates a sense of foreboding and raises the stakes.

The description of the outer case opening to reveal a small padded fridge adds to the sense of tension, as the reader realizes that the liver is likely damaged. The fact that the fridge has ruptured and is leaking refrigerated air creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes even further.

The use of words like "ruptured" and "split" adds to the sense of drama and creates a vivid image in the reader's mind. The slow escape of refrigerated air creates a sense of inevitability, as if the situation is spiraling out of control.

The final sentence, where the doctor presses the handle with his thumbs and hears a click, is a masterclass in suspense. The reader is left wondering what the click means, and whether it's a sign that the liver is still usable or if it's a sign of further damage. The paragraph ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader in a state of high suspense and eager to find out what happens next.

The paragraph starts with a sense of tension, as the surgeon's gloved hands guide a small syringe to the liver. The use of words like "approximately" and "halfway down" creates a sense of precision and raises the stakes, as the reader realizes that the surgeon is working with a very small margin of error.

The description of the laboratory setting, with everyone moving back to give the surgeon space to work, adds to the sense of drama and creates a vivid image in the reader's mind. The fact that the surgeon is wearing a mask and the atmosphere is tense creates a sense of gravity and importance.

The introduction of the idea that the surgeon could damage the organ irreparably if he is "one millimetre out" creates a sense of high stakes and raises the tension even further. The fact that the surgeon has carried out numerous biopsies before, but never with a child's life hanging in the balance, adds to the sense of emotional investment and raises the stakes even further.

The use of technical terms like "enzyme activity" and "metabolic rate" adds to the sense of authenticity and creates a sense of complexity, which raises the tension even further. The final sentence, "Everything depended on the metabolic rate," is a masterclass in suspense, as it creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "Will the biopsy be successful?" or "Will the child's life be saved?" The paragraph ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader in a state of high suspense and eager to find out what happens next.

The final sentence, "The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact," is a masterclass in suspense. The use of words like "worst fears" and "definitively deteriorated" creates a sense of finality and raises the stakes to a critical level. The reader is left with a sense of dread and uncertainty, wondering what will happen next and whether the child's life can still be saved. The paragraph ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader in a state of high suspense and eager to find out what happens next.

This paragraph is a masterclass in suspenseful storytelling. The use of a specific time, "21:26", creates a sense of finality and raises the stakes. The phrase "certified the death of Robert Bent" is a shocking and devastating revelation that creates a sense of tragedy and loss.

The fact that the medical team was unable to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage sustained in transit adds to the sense of tragedy and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "What if they had been able to transplant the liver?" or "Could they have saved Robert's life if they had acted faster?"
