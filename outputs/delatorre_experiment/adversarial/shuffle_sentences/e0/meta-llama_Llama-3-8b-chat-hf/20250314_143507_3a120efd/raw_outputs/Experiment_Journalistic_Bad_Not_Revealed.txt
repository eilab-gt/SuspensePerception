* The introduction of the two men leaving the roof via the service stairwell creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what they are doing and why.
* The arrival of the helicopter and the doctors creates a sense of anticipation and raises questions about what will happen to Robert Bent.
* However, the paragraph does not have a strong sense of danger or immediate threat, which is what typically drives suspense. The situation is critical, but it's not clear what the consequences will be or what will happen next.
