I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph starts with a sense of tension and urgency, as the men are watching the case being carried away with a sense of horror. This creates a sense of unease and curiosity.
* The description of the case making a noise like loose keys being shaken in a bag is an effective way to build tension and create a sense of unease.
* The mention of the metabolic rate and the fact that the organ hasn't been damaged by the impact adds a sense of relief, which is a good contrast to the tension that has been built up.
* The description of the fridge rupturing and the refrigerated air escaping adds to the sense of chaos and uncertainty.
* However, the paragraph is somewhat lacking in terms of a clear sense of danger or threat. The story is more focused on the aftermath of the event rather than the event itself, which makes it less suspenseful.

Overall, the paragraph does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of unease, but it could be more effective if it had a clearer sense of danger or threat.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. Here's why:

* The paragraph is extremely concise and to the point, which creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes.

* The brevity of the paragraph makes it feel like a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 9 out of 9 is that it's a very short paragraph and doesn't have much build-up or context. However, it's a very effective and suspenseful sentence that grabs the reader's attention and makes them want to know what happens next.
