I would rate this paragraph a 4 out of 9 for its suspensefulness.

The fact that the man's ankle hurts and he's bearing weight on his injured foot is more of a detail about his physical state than a source of suspense.

Overall, the paragraph has some mildly interesting elements, but it doesn't build much tension or create a sense of suspense. It's more of a straightforward narrative that doesn't have a strong sense of drama or danger.
