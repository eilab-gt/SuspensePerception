Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly life-or-death, with a child needing a transplant and time running out.
* **Building Tension:** The paragraph details the preparations, the wait, and the uncertainty surrounding the organ's condition. 
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The sentence about Robert's uncertain survival and the organ's damage creates a sense of anticipation and worry for the reader.

**What could make it more suspenseful:**

* **More Sensory Details:**  Describing the hospital atmosphere, Robert's condition, or the medical team's emotions could heighten the tension.
* **Internal Monologue:**  Including thoughts from Robert or a medical professional could add a personal and emotional layer to the suspense.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Setup:**  We know there's a time-sensitive situation with a critical patient and a helicopter arriving with a vital organ.
* **Lack of Detail:** The paragraph is very brief and lacks descriptive language or emotional context. We don't feel the urgency or the weight of the moment.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Adding Sensory Details:** Describe the sound of the helicopter, the tense atmosphere in the hospital, or the anticipation of the medical team.
* **Highlighting the Stakes:** Emphasize Robert's critical condition and the potential consequences if the organ doesn't arrive in time.

I'd rate this paragraph a **5/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Visual Detail:** The description of the men and the "small blue fridge" creates a concrete image in the reader's mind, which helps to build a sense of anticipation.
* **Importance of the Object:**  The phrase "fully functioning liver" emphasizes the significance of the object being carried, raising the stakes.
* **Lack of Emotional Context:**  While the image is intriguing, the paragraph lacks emotional depth. We don't feel the tension or the hope associated with the arrival of the organ.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Adding Sensory Details:** Describe the sound of the men's footsteps, the whirring of the helicopter blades, or the hushed atmosphere in the hospital.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Foreshadowing:** The lack of a "wet floor" sign clearly foreshadows a potential accident, which creates a sense of impending danger.
* **Lack of Context:**  We don't know who might be using the stairwell, or why their safety is particularly important. This lack of context weakens the suspense.
* **Passive Voice:** The use of the passive voice ("the cleaner had finished...") makes the paragraph feel detached and less immediate.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Adding a Character:** Introduce someone who is about to use the stairwell, creating a personal stake in the outcome.
* **Heightening the Stakes:**  Explain why a fall in the stairwell would be particularly dangerous or tragic.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  Suggest that someone is rushing to use the stairwell, increasing the likelihood of an accident.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Foreshadowing:**  The mention of the service stairwell, especially after the previous paragraph about the missing "wet floor" sign, creates a sense of potential danger.
* **Limited Information:** We don't know why they chose the service stairwell, or if there are any other factors that might make it risky. This lack of information leaves room for speculation and suspense.
* **Passive Voice:**  Similar to the previous paragraph, the passive voice ("they decided to walk down") makes the action feel less immediate and impactful.

**To increase the suspense, consider:**

* **Adding a Character's Motivation:**  Give a reason why the men chose the service stairwell, perhaps hinting at a secret or a desire to avoid attention.
* **Heightening the Stakes:**  Suggest that the liver is particularly fragile or that there's a time constraint, making the journey down the stairs more perilous.
* **Creating a Sensory Experience:**  Describe the sounds of the stairwell, the darkness, or the feeling of unease as they descend.
