The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a situation where a critical organ for a transplant has been damaged, and the recipient's survival is uncertain. The decision to walk down the stairwell adds a sense of urgency and tension to the situation. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. However, the first sentence may detract from the suspense as it suggests that the organ was not damaged, so the paragraph could be more effective if it began with the discovery of the ruptured bag. 

Revised rating: 7 out of 9.
