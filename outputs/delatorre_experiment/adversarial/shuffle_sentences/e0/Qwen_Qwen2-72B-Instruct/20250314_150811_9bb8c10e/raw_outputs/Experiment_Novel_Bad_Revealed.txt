The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a potentially tense situation involving a medical emergency and the transportation of a vital organ. The use of specific details, such as the temperature of the liver and the time-sensitive nature of the situation, adds to the sense of urgency. However, the lack of clear conflict or danger prevents the paragraph from reaching a higher level of suspense. I would rate it a 5 on the 9-point scale. 

However, since you asked for a single number, I will provide one: 5.

However, the suspense is somewhat diluted by the inclusion of details about the cleaner mopping the service stairwell and the description of the stairwell itself, which do not directly contribute to the suspense of the medical situation.
