The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a situation where a critical organ for a transplant has been damaged, and the recipient's survival is uncertain. The decision to walk down the stairwell adds a sense of urgency and tension to the situation. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 6 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. However, the first sentence may detract from the suspense as it suggests that the organ was not damaged, so the overall rating could be lower depending on the context in which the paragraph is presented. Without further context, a rating of 6 seems appropriate. If you want a more suspenseful rating, you could consider removing the first sentence or rephrasing it to create more uncertainty about the organ's condition. Here is an example of a more suspenseful version of the paragraph:
"The two men transporting the liver left the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell, which they decided to walk down. When they opened the case, they discovered that the interior bag had ruptured. The doctors arrived promptly, but they were not sure if the organ was still viable for the transplant. Robert's situation was critical, and they knew that every second counted. Would they be able to save his life, or would the damaged organ prove to be a fatal setback?" This version of the paragraph creates more uncertainty about the organ's condition and emphasizes the urgency of the situation, making it more suspenseful. I would rate this paragraph an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. However, the level of suspense may vary depending on the reader's personal preferences and the context in which the paragraph is presented.

The paragraph does not contain any elements of suspense. It simply describes a scene where two men, one carrying a container with a liver, are exiting a helicopter. There is no uncertainty, tension, or conflict that would make the paragraph suspenseful. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 1 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness. If you want to add suspense to the paragraph, you could include details that create uncertainty or tension, such as the condition of the liver, the urgency of the situation, or potential obstacles that the men may face.

"The helicopter landed on the roof of the hospital, and two men quickly exited, one carrying a small blue fridge in the shape of a case. Inside the fridge was a fully functioning liver, the only hope for a patient in critical condition. As they rushed towards the stairwell, the man carrying the fridge stumbled, and the container fell to the ground. Would the liver still be viable after the fall, or had their hopes been shattered in an instant?"
This version of the paragraph creates suspense by introducing a potential obstacle (the fall) that could jeopardize the success of the transplant. The urgency of the situation is also emphasized, as the liver is the only hope for a patient in critical condition. I would rate this paragraph a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
