While the mention of a liver transplant and the arrival of the men from a helicopter could potentially create some suspense, the paragraph lacks details that would heighten the suspense. The description of the liver being in a small blue fridge is unusual but does not contribute significantly to the overall suspense. The paragraph could benefit from more context or additional details about the situation or the characters' emotions to increase the level of suspense.
