The setting in a children's hospital, the critical condition of the young boy, and the imminent liver transplant create a sense of urgency and tension.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. The arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ adds a sense of anticipation, but the fact that it landed "punctually" and Robert is in a "critical but stable condition" suggests that the outcome is not in immediate danger. The suspense comes from the question of whether the organ will be in good enough condition to save Robert, but this is not fully explored in this paragraph.

However, if the paragraph were to be followed by a revelation that the service stairwell was not properly lit or had other hazards, it could potentially add to the suspense.   For example: "The two men transporting the liver left the roof via the doorway to the service stairwell, which they decided to walk down, despite the dim lighting and the fact that the stairwell had been known to have loose steps."   In this revised version, the mention of the dim lighting and loose steps adds a sense of danger and uncertainty, increasing the suspense.
