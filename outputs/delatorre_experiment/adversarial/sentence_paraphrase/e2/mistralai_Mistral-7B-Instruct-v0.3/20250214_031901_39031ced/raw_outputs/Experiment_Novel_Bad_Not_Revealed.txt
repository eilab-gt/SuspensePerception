 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "entire medical team" and the "suitable donor." However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Robert's condition or the challenges that the medical team might face during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually," but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ or the helicopter ride, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant.  For example, "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition. As the medical team rushed to unload the organ, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as they knew that every second counted."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds to the suspense by describing the urgency of the situation and the importance of the organ, as well as the actions of the men carrying it. The use of sensory details, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "blue case," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the patient's critical condition and the need to "have no time to lose." Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible. Realizing that he hadn’t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. As they rushed through the hospital corridors, they could hear the beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff, all working frantically to save the life of the young boy."  This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment and the urgency of the situation, which increases the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story and instead provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the cleanliness of the service stairwell. While the paragraph is well-written and provides a sense of normalcy, it does not add to the tension or build anticipation for the events that are about to unfold. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to focus more on the hospital environment and the sense of urgency that is building. For example, "Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner hurriedly finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, knowing that something important was about to happen in the hospital. The service stairwell was usually quiet and empty, but today there was a sense of tension in the air. The cleaner, who preferred the more social corridors where he could chat with the doctors and patients, quickly gathered his things and took the lift back down to the ground floor, eager to start his typical working day." This paragraph sets the stage for the suspenseful events that are about to occur and creates a sense of unease in the hospital environment.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides more details about the hospital environment and the route that the men are taking to deliver the organ, which adds to the suspense. The use of specific details, such as the "helipad exit," "service stairwell," and "central archives," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the need to "walk down two floors" instead of taking the lift. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital’s secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor. It’s not worth taking the lift,” he said, realising his colleague’s intention. “By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it’ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.” His colleague nodded, knowing that every second counted as they rushed down the service stairwell, the weight of the precious organ pressing heavily on his shoulder. The sound of the beeping monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff echoed through the hospital corridors as they made their way to the 6th floor, where the young boy was waiting for his life-saving transplant." This paragraph adds more details about the hospital environment, the urgency of the situation, and the weight of the organ, which increases the suspense.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the unexpected event of the man slipping on the stairs and the case rolling down. The use of sensory details, such as the "noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the need to "recover his balance" and the use of the phrase "the two men held their breath." Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the case rolling down the stairs or the impact it might have on the transplant. For example, "His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs, bouncing and spinning over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror as the case tumbled down the stairs, each step bringing them closer to the possibility that the organ might be damaged. The weight of the organ pressing heavily on his shoulder, the man clung to the bannister, his heart racing as he struggled to catch his breath. The sound of the beeping monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff echoed through the hospital corridors as they made their way to the 6th floor, where the young boy was waiting for his life-saving transplant." This paragraph adds more details about the consequences of the case rolling down the stairs and the impact it might have on the transplant, which increases the suspense.

The use of the phrase "We don’t know if it’s been damaged" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the need to "call the doctors." The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the man "setting off down the stairs" and "walking quickly" to alert the medical team. However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of a damaged organ or the impact it might have on the transplant. For example, "Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other with a sense of dread. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. The weight of the organ pressing heavily on his shoulder, the man clung to the case, his heart racing as he struggled to catch his breath. He knew that every second counted, and the fate of the young boy hung in the balance. The sound of the beeping monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff echoed through the hospital corridors as he made his way to the transplant department, praying that the organ was still viable." This paragraph adds more details about the consequences of a damaged organ and the impact it might have on the transplant, which increases the suspense.  Additionally, the use of the phrase "the fate of the young boy hangs in the balance" creates a sense of urgency and adds to the overall suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense with the mention of the man's superstition that the condition of the liver depends on his suffering. The use of the phrase "he was bearing his weight on his injured foot" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the doctors rushing up the service stairwell. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the doctors "kneeling down next to the case." However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the doctors' reactions or the condition of the liver. For example, "Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell, their footsteps echoing through the hospital corridors. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. “Move away, please,” asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case, his face a mask of concentration as he carefully opened the case and examined the liver. The other doctors gathered around, their expressions a mix of relief and concern as they assessed the organ. The weight of the organ pressing heavily on his shoulder, the man clung to the bannister, his heart racing as he watched the doctors work."

The use of the phrase "a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the doctor shaking his head. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the need to "close the case." However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the impact of the ruptured fridge on the liver or the consequences of a damaged organ. For example, "He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look, the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case, his face a mask of disappointment as he realized that the ruptured fridge had caused irreparable damage to the liver. The weight of the organ pressing heavily on his shoulder, the man clung to the bannister, his heart racing as he watched the doctor's expression change from hope to despair. The sound of the beeping monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff echoed through the hospital corridors as they made their way to the transplant department, knowing that the young boy's chances of survival had just been severely diminished."

For example, "Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the severe damage that the organ sustained in transit.

The sound of the beeping monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff echoed through the hospital corridors as they made their way to the transplant department, knowing that the young boy's family would soon be informed of the tragic news.
