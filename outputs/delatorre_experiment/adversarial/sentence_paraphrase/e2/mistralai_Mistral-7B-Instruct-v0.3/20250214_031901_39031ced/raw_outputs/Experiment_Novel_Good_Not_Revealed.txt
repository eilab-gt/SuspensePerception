 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "entire medical team" and the "suitable donor." However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Robert's condition or the challenges that the medical team might face during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually," but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ or the helicopter ride, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant.  For example, "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition. As the medical team rushed to unload the organ, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as they knew that every second counted."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds to the suspense by describing the urgency of the situation and the importance of the organ, as well as the actions of the men carrying it. The use of sensory details, such as the "whirlwind of the spinning blades" and the "blue case," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the patient's critical condition and the need to "have no time to lose." Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible. Realizing that he hadn’t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. As they rushed through the hospital corridors, they could hear the sound of alarms blaring and the voices of medical staff shouting orders. They knew that every second counted and that the fate of the young boy, Robert Bent, hung in the balance."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story and instead provides a tangential and unrelated description of a hospital cleaner's routine. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to provide more details about the hospital or the medical team, or it could be used to create a sense of foreshadowing or tension. For example, "Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell, unaware of the life-or-death drama unfolding just a few floors above him. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital’s eight floors. It wasn’t a particularly interesting job, but as he whistled and worked, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of color on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. Overall, it was an agreeable job. However, the service stairwell wasn’t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building’s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn’t bother to position the ”wet floor” warning signs at the top of each section. That morning, as he finished mopping in fifteen minutes and took the lift back down to the ground floor, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. He would soon find out that his instincts were right."  This revised paragraph creates a sense of foreshadowing and tension by suggesting that the cleaner has a feeling that something is off, which turns out to be true later in the story.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency and tension as the men decide to take the stairs instead of the elevator to reach the patient more quickly. The use of specific details, such as the "helipad exit," "service stairwell," and "east wing lift," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the patient being on the 6th floor and the need to "wait for it to come" if they take the elevator. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the challenges that the men might face during the transplant. For example, "The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital’s secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor. It’s not worth taking the lift,” he said, realising his colleague’s intention. “By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it’ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.” His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand. As they rushed down the stairs, they could hear the sound of alarms blaring and the voices of medical staff shouting orders. They knew that every second counted and that the fate of the young boy, Robert Bent, hung in the balance."  This revised paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the sound of alarms and the voices of medical staff, which suggests that the situation is critical.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the man's accident and the potential loss of the organ. The use of sensory details, such as the "noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the case rolling down the stairs and the men holding their breath in horror. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of losing the organ or the efforts of the men to retrieve it. For example, "His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. As the case rolled closer to the bottom of the stairs, the men knew that they had to act quickly to retrieve it before it was too late. They rushed down the stairs, their hearts pounding in their chests, and managed to catch the case just before it reached the bottom. But as they picked it up, they could feel that it was warm to the touch, and they knew that precious seconds had been lost."  This revised paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the men's efforts to retrieve the case and the potential consequences of losing it.  The revised paragraph also adds a sense of danger and stakes, as the case is described as being warm to the touch, which suggests that the organ may have been damaged during the fall.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the men's concern about the organ's condition and the need to act quickly. The use of specific details, such as the "complex network of corridors" and the "reception desk in the transplant department," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the man rushing to alert the medical team. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of not being able to transplant the organ in time or the efforts of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. As he rushed through the hospital, he could hear the sound of alarms blaring and the voices of medical staff shouting orders. He knew that every second counted and that the fate of the young boy, Robert Bent, hung in the balance. The medical team worked quickly and efficiently, but as they reached the operating room, they could see that the organ was already starting to deteriorate. They knew that they had to act fast if they were to save Robert’s life."  This revised paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the organ's deterioration and the medical team's efforts to save the patient.  The revised paragraph also adds a sense of danger and stakes,

  I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the man's superstition and his willingness to endure pain in exchange for the liver's condition. The use of specific details, such as the "service stairwell" and the "three doctors," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the doctors rushing up the stairwell. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of not being able to transplant the organ in time or the efforts of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. “Move away, please,” asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. As they worked quickly and efficiently, he could hear the sound of alarms blaring and the voices of medical staff shouting orders. He knew that every second counted and that the fate of the young boy, Robert Bent, hung in the balance. The medical team worked tirelessly, but as they reached the operating room, they could see that the organ was already starting to deteriorate. They knew that they had to act fast if they were to save Robert’s life."  This revised paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the organ's deterioration and the medical team's efforts to save the patient.  The revised paragraph also adds a sense of danger and stakes, as the organ is described as starting to deteriorate, which suggests that

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the damage to the organ and the doctor's reaction. The use of specific details, such as the "click" and the "long split," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the refrigerated air escaping. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of not being able to transplant the organ in time or the efforts of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The medical team worked tirelessly, but as they reached the operating room, they could see that the organ was already starting to deteriorate. They knew that they had to act fast if they were to save Robert’s life. The clock was ticking, and every second counted. The medical team worked with a sense of urgency, but as they prepared to transplant the organ, they realized that it was already too late. The organ was beyond repair, and Robert’s chances of survival were slim."  This revised paragraph creates a sense of urgency and tension by describing the organ's deterioration and the medical team's efforts to save the patient, as well as the ticking clock and the slim chances of survival.  The revised paragraph also adds a sense of danger and stakes, as the organ is described as being beyond repair, which suggests that the patient may not survive.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the surgeon's nervousness and the importance of the biopsy. The use of specific details, such as the "hepatology laboratory" and the "small syringe," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the child's life hanging in the balance and the need for a precise biopsy. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of damaging the organ or the efforts of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child’s life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. The medical team worked tirelessly, but as they reached the operating room, they could see that the organ was already starting to deteriorate. They knew that they had to act fast if they were to save Robert’s life. The clock was ticking, and every second counted. The surgeon took a deep breath, steadied his hand, and made the incision. As he withdrew the syringe, he could feel the organ trembling in his hand. He knew that this was it, the moment of truth. If the biopsy results were positive, they would have a chance to save Robert. If not, it would be too late."  This revised

 I would rate this paragraph as a 8 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing the surgeon's anxiety and the importance of the biopsy results. The use of specific details, such as the "needle," "Petri dish," and "microscope," helps to create a vivid image in the reader's mind and increases the tension. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the mention of the interminable half a minute and the surgeon's anxious colleagues. Overall, this paragraph effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of damaging the organ or the efforts of the medical team to save the patient. For example, "Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate gave cause for optimism: the organ had not been damaged by the impact. But the surgeon knew that this was only the first step. The organ still had to be transplanted, and there was no guarantee that it would take in the patient's body. The medical team worked tirelessly, but as they reached the operating room, they could see that the organ was already starting to deteriorate. They knew that they had to act fast if they were to save Robert’s life. The clock was ticking, and every second counted. The surgeon took a deep breath, steadied his hand, and made the incision.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution, but it does not create a sense of tension or suspense. The use of specific details, such as the time, helps to create a sense of time passing, but it does not contribute to the overall suspense of the story. Overall, this paragraph is not suspenseful and does not contribute to the overall tension of the story.  However, to increase the suspense even further, the paragraph could provide more details about the patient's condition or the efforts of the medical team to save him. For example, "Finally, at 21:26, the medical team verified that Robert Bent’s newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly, and had not been affected by the damage that it sustained in transit. But the team knew that their work was not over yet. Robert was still critically ill, and they would have to monitor him closely to ensure that the transplant was successful. The medical team worked tirelessly, but as they reached the intensive care unit, they could see that Robert was still fighting for his life. They knew that every second counted, and they would have to work quickly and efficiently to give him the best chance of survival."  This revised paragraph creates a sense of relief and resolution, but it also creates a sense of tension and urgency, as the patient is still critically ill and the medical team has to work quickly and efficiently to ensure the transplant is successful.  The revised paragraph also adds a sense of danger and stakes, as the patient is described as still fighting for his life.
