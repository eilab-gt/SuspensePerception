 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The setting in a children's hospital, the critical condition of the young boy, and the imminent liver transplant create a sense of urgency and tension. The uncertainty about whether Robert will survive the wait and the unexpected turn of events with the organ's damage in transit contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the events leading up to the transplant and the emotions of the characters involved.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. While the arrival of the helicopter carrying the organ adds a sense of anticipation, the paragraph does not provide enough context or details to create a high level of suspense. The paragraph could be more suspenseful if it described the emotions of the medical team and Robert's family as they awaited the arrival of the organ, or if it hinted at potential complications or delays that could jeopardize the transplant. 2. At 08:57, the helicopter carrying the organ landed on the roof of the hospital, but as the medical team rushed to unload it, they discovered that the organ was not in its container. The helicopter crew reported that they had dropped the organ during the flight, and it was now lost somewhere over the city. The medical team was left with no choice but to continue searching for the organ while Robert's condition deteriorated. This is the story of what happened.

I would rate this revised paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The unexpected loss of the organ and the deteriorating condition of Robert add a sense of urgency and tension, creating a more suspenseful atmosphere. The paragraph also provides more details about the events and the emotions of the characters involved, which helps to build suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The description of the men rushing to unload the organ and the sense of urgency created by the critical condition of the patient add to the suspenseful atmosphere. The use of sensory details, such as the wind blowing the men's hair and the cold temperature of the organ, help to create a vivid and tense scene. The paragraph also creates a sense of mystery with the inaudible shout and the need for the men to hurry. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the patient's condition or the consequences of not finding the organ in time. 3. Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible, but it was clear from his frantic gestures that something was wrong. Realizing that he hadn’t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. But as they reached the doorway, they found it blocked by a group of armed men in black suits. The men demanded to know what was in the case and why they were trying to leave the hospital roof. The man carrying the case hesitated, unsure of what to do. The other man, realizing the danger, pushed him forward and shouted something in a language neither of them understood. The armed men, confused, stepped aside and let them pass. But as they reached the elevator, the doors refused to open. The man carrying the case looked at his watch again, his heart pounding in his chest. They had only minutes left to save the patient.

I would rate this revised paragraph as an 8 on the suspensefulness scale. The addition of the armed men and the blocked doorway creates a sense of danger and tension, increasing the suspense.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 1 on the suspensefulness scale. The paragraph provides a detailed description of the cleaner's routine and the mundane nature of his job, which creates a sense of normalcy and lack of tension. The paragraph does not contain any elements that would create a sense of urgency or danger, and the lack of context or foreshadowing makes it difficult to build suspense. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it hinted at a connection to the main story or if it created a sense of unease or mystery. 4. Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital’s eight floors. It wasn’t a particularly interesting job. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of color on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. Overall, it was an agreeable job. However, the service stairwell wasn’t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building’s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn’t bother to position the “wet floor” warning signs at the top of each section. That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley and continued his typical working day. But as he was walking down the corridor, he heard a faint noise coming from the service stairwell. He paused, listening intently. It sounded like someone was crying. He hesitated for a moment, then decided to investigate. As he reached the service stairwell, he saw a small, shivering figure huddled in the corner. It was a young boy, no older than ten, with a bandage around his head and a look of terror in his eyes

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the suspensefulness scale. While the paragraph provides some details about the layout of the hospital and the urgency of the situation, it does not contain any elements that would create a high level of suspense. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the patient's condition or the consequences of not finding the organ in time, or if it hinted at potential obstacles or complications that the men might encounter on their way to the patient. 5. The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital's secondary corridors. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom, and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. “The patient is on the 6th floor. It’s not worth taking the lift,” he said, realizing his colleague’s intention. “By the time we get there and wait for it to come, it’ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.” His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand. But as they started to descend the stairs, they heard a loud crash coming from above. They exchanged a worried look, then continued down the stairs as quickly as they could. When they reached the 6th floor, they found the door to the patient's room locked. The man with the case began to panic, pounding on the door with his fists. “Open up! It’s an emergency!” he shouted, but there was no answer. The man with the case looked at his watch again, his heart pounding in his chest. They had only minutes left to save the patient.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The unexpected slip and fall of the man carrying the case creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, as the reader wonders if the organ will be damaged or lost. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the case spinning down the stairs, helps to create a vivid and suspenseful scene. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the ticking clock and the need to save the patient. However, the paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the consequences of losing the organ or the emotions of the characters involved. 6. His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn’t stay upright. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. The man with the case looked at his watch again, his heart pounding in his chest. They had only minutes left to save the patient. But as they reached the bottom of the stairs, they found the case lying on its side, the lid slightly open. The man with the case let out a sigh of relief, but his relief was short-lived. When he opened the case, he found that the organ was not there. It had been damaged during the fall and was no longer usable. The man with the case looked at his colleague, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief. They had lost the organ and with it, the chance to save the patient.

The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the consequences of losing the organ or the emotions of the characters involved. 7. Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. “Don’t!” warned his colleague, “We don’t know if it’s been damaged. It’s best to call the doctors.” The other nodded, pulling back his hand. “I’ll go,” continued the first. “You stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.” Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. But as he reached the desk, he found it empty. The receptionist was nowhere to be seen. He looked around, his heart pounding in his chest. He had no time to waste. He turned and ran back towards the service stairwell, hoping to find his colleague still watching the case. But as he reached the landing, he found it empty. The case was gone. He looked around frantically, his mind racing. He had lost the organ and with it, the chance to save the patient. He had no idea where it could have gone.

Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn’t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. However, the doctors were soon there. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. “Move away, please,” asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. “We need to check the organ,” he continued, opening the case. The man with the injured ankle looked on, his heart pounding in his chest. He closed his eyes, praying that the organ was still usable. The doctors worked quickly, checking the organ for any signs of damage. After what felt like an eternity, one of the doctors looked up. “It’s fine,” he said, closing the case. “We can proceed with the transplant.” The man with the injured ankle let out a sigh of relief, but his relief was short-lived. As they were about to leave the service stairwell, he heard a loud noise coming from the corridor. He looked up, his heart pounding in his chest. A group of armed men in black suits were storming towards them, weapons drawn. “Freeze!” one of them shouted, pointing his gun at the doctors. “This is a raid. You are all under arrest for trafficking illegal org

He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. The doctor looked at his watch, his face pale. They had only minutes left to save the patient. He turned to the man with the injured ankle. “We need to get to the operating room as quickly as possible,” he said, urgently. The man with the injured ankle nodded, grabbing the case and limping towards the service stairwell. But as they reached the landing, they found it blocked by a group of armed men in black suits. The men demanded to know what was in the case and why they were trying to leave the hospital roof. The man with the injured ankle hesitated, unsure of what to do.

The man with the injured ankle nodded, and the two of them started to run down the corridor, looking for an alternative exit. But as they turned a corner, they found themselves face to face with a group of armed

 I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the suspensefulness scale. The description of the delicate procedure and the high stakes involved create a sense of tension and uncertainty. The use of sensory details, such as the description of the surgeon's gloved hands and the small syringe, helps to create a vivid and suspenseful scene. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the need to act quickly and accurately. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the child's condition or the consequences of damaging the organ. 10. According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. He felt decidedly nervous. He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child’s life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. The surgeon took a deep breath, steadying his hand. He closed his eyes, focusing on the task at hand. With a swift, precise movement, he made the puncture. The liver tissue was extracted and placed on a slide for analysis. The surgeon looked at the slide, his heart pounding in his chest. The results would determine whether the child would live or die. He looked up at the clock on the wall, his eyes wide with fear. He had only minutes left to save the child.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 9 on the suspensefulness scale. The description of the tense and delicate procedure, the use of sensory details such as the surgeon's sweaty brow and the interminable half a minute of waiting, and the high stakes involved create a sense of tension and uncertainty. The paragraph also creates a sense of urgency with the need to act quickly and accurately. The paragraph could potentially be more suspenseful if it provided more details about the child's condition or the consequences of the organ's deterioration. 11. Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact. The surgeon looked at the clock on the wall, his eyes wide with fear. He had only minutes left to save the child. He looked at the liver on the table, his heart pounding in his chest. He had failed. The child was going to die. He looked at his colleagues, his voice shaking as he spoke. “I’m sorry. There’s nothing more we can do.” The room fell silent, the weight of the failure heavy in the air. The surgeon turned and walked out of the laboratory, leaving the team to deal with the devastating news. He walked down the corridor, his mind racing. He had let a child down. He had let a family down. He had let himself down. He walked faster, his footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. He reached the service stairwell and started to descend, his thoughts consumed by the guilt and regret. He had failed. He had failed.

  I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the suspensefulness scale. The description of the failed transplant and the death of the patient creates a sense of tension and sadness. The use of the specific time adds a sense of finality and closure to the story.

Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. The news was met with a heavy silence in the operating room. The surgeon looked at the clock on the wall, his heart heavy with disappointment. He had failed. He had failed to save the life of a child. He looked at the liver on the table, his mind racing with thoughts of what could have been. He looked at his colleagues, their faces reflecting the same sense of loss and regret. He walked out of the operating room, his footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. He reached the service stairwell and started to descend, his thoughts consumed by the guilt and regret. He had failed. He had failed. He had let a child down. He had let a family down. He had let himself down. He walked faster, his footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. He reached the ground floor and walked out of the hospital, the cold night air hitting him like a slap. He walked down the street, his mind consumed by the weight of his failure. He had let a child die. He had let a family suffer. He had let himself suffer. He walked faster, his heart pounding in his chest. He had failed. He had failed. He had failed.
