I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the medical team and the patient waiting for a liver transplant. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph is still relatively straightforward and doesn't have any major plot twists or surprises, which prevents it from being more suspenseful. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which also reduces the suspenseful effect.
