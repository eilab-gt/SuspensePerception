I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the medical team and the patient waiting for a liver transplant. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph is still relatively straightforward and doesn't have any major plot twists or surprises, which prevents it from being more suspenseful. The tone is more informative and matter-of-fact, which also reduces the suspenseful effect.

I would rate this paragraph an 8 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by describing the scene in vivid detail, using words like "whirlwind", "blown", and "no time to lose". The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the rotors and the feeling of the wind, immerses the reader in the scene and makes them feel like they are there. The fact that the men are in a hurry and that the patient is in a critical situation adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The nod and the movement towards the exit also creates a sense of anticipation and expectation, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The only thing that prevents it from being a 9 out of 9 is that it's still a relatively straightforward and factual description, without any major plot twists or surprises.

The use of words like "agreeable", "friendly", and "enjoyable" creates a sense of calm and normalcy, and the description of the service stairwell as "dull" and "never dirty" reinforces the idea that nothing out of the ordinary is happening.

The fact that they are walking down the stairs instead of taking the lift creates a sense of unease, as it implies that they are in a hurry and that time is of the essence. The use of words like "realising" and "shrugged" also adds to the sense of tension, as it implies that the men are aware of the gravity of the situation.

The use of words like "don't", "warned", and "nodded" also adds to the sense of tension and urgency.
