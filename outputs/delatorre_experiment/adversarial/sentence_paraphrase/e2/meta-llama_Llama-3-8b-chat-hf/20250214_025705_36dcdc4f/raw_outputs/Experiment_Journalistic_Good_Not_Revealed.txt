I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the medical team and the patient waiting for a liver transplant. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph is still relatively straightforward and lacks a strong sense of surprise or unexpected twists, which would elevate the suspense to a higher level.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The introduction of the small blue fridge, which stores the fully functioning liver, adds a sense of intrigue and unexpectedness to the story. The use of the word "case" instead of "container" or "package" adds a sense of mystery, implying that this is not just a ordinary medical procedure. The image of the two men descending from the helicopter, one carrying a small blue fridge, is also quite vivid and unusual, which adds to the sense of tension and suspense.

The use of the word "minutes earlier" also adds a sense of timing and proximity, implying that something is about to go wrong. However, the paragraph is still relatively low-key and lacks a strong sense of urgency or high stakes, which would elevate the suspense to a higher level.
