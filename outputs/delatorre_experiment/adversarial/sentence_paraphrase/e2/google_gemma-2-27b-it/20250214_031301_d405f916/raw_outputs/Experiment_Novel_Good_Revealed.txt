I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and needs the transplant to survive. This creates some tension.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The wait for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential problems:** The mention of the liver being damaged in transit raises the possibility of complications.

However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right at the end of the paragraph. This removes much of the suspense.
* **The language is relatively straightforward:** There's not much use of vivid imagery or sensory details to heighten the tension.


To make it more suspenseful, you could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader guessing about Robert's fate until later in the story.
* **Focus on Robert's experience:** Describe his feelings and thoughts during the wait.
* **Use more evocative language:** Create a more immersive and tense atmosphere.
