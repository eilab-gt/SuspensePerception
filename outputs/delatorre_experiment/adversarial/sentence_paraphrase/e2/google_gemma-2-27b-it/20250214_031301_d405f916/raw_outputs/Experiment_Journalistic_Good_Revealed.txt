I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness.

* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The wait for the organ adds a sense of urgency.

However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right at the end of the paragraph. This removes much of the suspense.
* **The language is relatively straightforward:** There's not much use of vivid imagery or sensory details to heighten the tension.


To make it more suspenseful, you could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader guessing about Robert's fate for longer.
