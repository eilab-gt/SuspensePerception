I'd rate this paragraph a **4** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It establishes stakes:** We know Robert is in a critical condition and needs the transplant to survive. This creates some tension.
* **It introduces a ticking clock:** The wait for the organ adds a sense of urgency.
* **It hints at potential problems:** The mention of the liver being damaged in transit raises the possibility of complications.

However:

* **The outcome is revealed too early:**  We learn the transplant was successful right at the end of the paragraph. This removes much of the suspense.
* **The language is relatively straightforward:** There's not much use of vivid imagery or sensory details to heighten the tension.


To make it more suspenseful, you could:

* **Delay revealing the outcome:** Keep the reader guessing about Robert's fate until later in the story.
* **Focus on Robert's experience:** Describe his feelings and thoughts as he waits for the transplant.
* **Build tension through sensory details:** Describe the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital environment.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **It introduces a key event:** The arrival of the organ is a crucial moment in the story, raising the stakes.
* **It uses precise timing:** The specific time (08:57) adds a sense of immediacy and urgency.

However:

* **It lacks emotional weight:** We don't get a sense of the characters' feelings or the tension surrounding the event.
* **It's a relatively straightforward statement:** There's not much use of figurative language or sensory details to create suspense.


To make it more suspenseful, you could:

* **Describe the atmosphere:** What's the mood like in the hospital? Are people anxious, hopeful, tense?
* **Focus on Robert's perspective:** How does he feel knowing the organ has arrived?
* **Use more vivid language:** Instead of simply stating the facts, use descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader's mind. For example, you could describe the sound of the helicopter blades, the rush of adrenaline in the operating room, or the worried faces of Robert's family.

Here's why:

* **Mundane details:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful aspects of the cleaner's job.

I'd rate this paragraph a **3** in terms of suspensefulness.

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** This paragraph provides a resolution to the suspense built up throughout the story. We learn that the transplant was successful, which relieves the tension.
* **Lack of build-up:** The paragraph itself doesn't build suspense. It simply states the outcome.
