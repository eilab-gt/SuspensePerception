The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it sets up a high-stakes situation with a clear time pressure and uncertainty about the outcome. The use of specific details, such as the location, date, and the patient's name, adds to the sense of realism and immediacy. The mention of the critical situation and the uncertainty of whether the patient will survive the wait for the organ transplant creates tension and makes the reader want to know what happens next. I would rate this paragraph a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

Without further details about what happens next, the suspense is not fully realized in this paragraph. I would rate this paragraph a 2 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
