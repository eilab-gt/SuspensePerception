The paragraph has a high level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a tragic outcome. The fact that the story is based on a true event adds to the tension, as does the description of the medical team's efforts to save the boy's life. The uncertainty of whether the boy would survive the wait for the transplant also adds to the suspense. Overall, I would rate this paragraph as an 8 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.

However, the tragic nature of the event and the description of the events leading up to it still make it a very suspenseful read.
