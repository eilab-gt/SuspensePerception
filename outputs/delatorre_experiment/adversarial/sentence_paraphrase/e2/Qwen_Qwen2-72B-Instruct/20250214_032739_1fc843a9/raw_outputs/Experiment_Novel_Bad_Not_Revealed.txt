The paragraph has a moderate to high level of suspense, but it is more of a resolution with a tragic outcome rather than building suspense. The finality of the situation, with the death of Robert Bent and the inability to perform the transplant, creates a sense of closure that is emotionally charged. The specific time mentioned adds to the sense of immediacy and the gravity of the situation. However, since the outcome is presented as a fact rather than as a developing event, the suspense is more retrospective, focusing on the impact of the events rather than on the uncertainty of the outcome. I would rate this paragraph a 7 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
