The paragraph has a moderate level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a high-stakes medical procedure and an uncertain outcome. The fact that the boy's situation was critical and that the success of the transplant was in doubt adds to the tension. However, the paragraph does not contain any dramatic twists or cliffhangers, and the outcome is revealed relatively early on. Therefore, I would rate the paragraph a 5 on the 9-point scale for suspensefulness.
