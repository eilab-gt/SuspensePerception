The paragraph has a high level of suspense, as it describes a real-life event with a tragic outcome. The fact that the story is based on a true event adds to the tension, as does the description of the medical team's efforts to save the boy's life.

However, the tragic nature of the event and the details provided still make it a very suspenseful read.
