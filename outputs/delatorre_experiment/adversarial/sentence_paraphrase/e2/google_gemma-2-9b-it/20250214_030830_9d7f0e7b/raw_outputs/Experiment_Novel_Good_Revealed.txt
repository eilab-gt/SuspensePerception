I'd rate this paragraph a **4 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Add Sensory Details:** Describe the atmosphere in the operating room, the smell of antiseptic, the hushed voices, the feeling of anticipation.
* **Focus on a Character's Perspective:** Show us the relief or worry of one of the doctors or nurses as they await the results.
