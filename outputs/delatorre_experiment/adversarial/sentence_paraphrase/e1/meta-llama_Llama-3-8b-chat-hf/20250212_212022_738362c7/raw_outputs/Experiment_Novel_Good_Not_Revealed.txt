I would rate this paragraph a 6 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph sets up a sense of anticipation and tension by introducing a critical situation and a sense of urgency, with the medical team and the patient waiting for a liver transplant. The mention of the patient's critical condition and the uncertainty of his survival adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph is still relatively straightforward and lacks a strong sense of surprise or unexpected twists, which would elevate the suspense to a higher level.

The paragraph provides a sense of relief and resolution by stating that the helicopter landed punctually, which implies that the organ has arrived.

I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph creates a sense of tension and urgency by emphasizing the importance of speed and the critical condition of the patient. The use of vivid details, such as the whirlwind of the spinning blades and the men's hair being blown, helps to create a sense of chaos and intensity. The fact that the men are trying to communicate with each other over the noise of the blades adds to the sense of urgency and raises questions about what they are trying to convey. The nod and the movement towards the exit also create a sense of anticipation and expectation, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The only thing that keeps it from being a 9 out of 9 is that the outcome is still somewhat predictable, and there is no major surprise or twist.

I would rate this paragraph a 1 out of 9 for its suspensefulness. The paragraph is a detailed and mundane description of a cleaner's daily routine, with no hint of tension, danger, or surprise. The use of words like "agreeable", "friendly", and "enjoyable" to describe the cleaner's job and interactions with others further emphasizes the lack of suspense. The paragraph is more of a descriptive passage than a suspenseful one, and the reader is not left wondering what will happen next or feeling a sense of anticipation. The only thing that might be slightly suspenseful is the fact that the cleaner didn't put up the "wet floor" warning signs, but this is not developed further and is not a significant enough plot point to create suspense.

The use of the phrase "it's not worth taking the lift" also adds a sense of realism to the scene, which may make the reader feel like they are experiencing the scene firsthand, but it doesn't necessarily create a sense of suspense.
