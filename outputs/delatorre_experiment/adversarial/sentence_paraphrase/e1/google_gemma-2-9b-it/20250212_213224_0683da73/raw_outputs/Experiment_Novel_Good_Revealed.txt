Here's why:

I'd rate this paragraph a **1 out of 9** for suspensefulness. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Conflict or Tension:** The paragraph describes a mundane, routine task. There are no obstacles, challenges, or threats.
* **Passive Voice and Telling:** The writing relies heavily on passive voice ("the cleaner had finished," "the staff used the lifts") and tells us about the job's pleasantness rather than showing it through action or description.
* **No Hook:** There's nothing in the paragraph to grab the reader's attention or make them want to know what happens next.

**To increase the suspense, the paragraph could:**

* **Introduce an anomaly:**  Perhaps the cleaner finds something unusual in the stairwell, or notices something out of place.
* **Hint at a threat:**  Maybe there's a strange noise, a feeling of being watched, or a sense of unease in the otherwise ordinary setting.
* **Create a sense of foreboding:**  Use foreshadowing to suggest that something bad might happen, or that the routine is about to be disrupted.



This paragraph is more of a slice-of-life description than a suspenseful piece.  It needs a significant shift in tone and focus to create any real tension.

* **Introduce an obstacle:**  Perhaps the stairwell is blocked, or the men encounter a problem along the way.
