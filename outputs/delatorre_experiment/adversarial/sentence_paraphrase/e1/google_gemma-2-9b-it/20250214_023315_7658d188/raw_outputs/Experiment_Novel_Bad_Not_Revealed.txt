I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child's life hangs in the balance, and time is running out.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends with "This is the story of what happened," leaving the reader wanting to know the outcome.

**What's Missing:**

* **Sensory Details:** The paragraph lacks vivid descriptions that could heighten the tension. We don't feel the urgency or the fear in the hospital.
* **Character Development:** We know very little about Robert or the medical team.  Connecting with them emotionally would increase the suspense.
* **Internal Conflict:**  Adding thoughts or feelings from Robert or the doctors could create a more palpable sense of anxiety.


Overall, the paragraph sets up a suspenseful situation, but it could be even more gripping with more sensory details and emotional depth.
