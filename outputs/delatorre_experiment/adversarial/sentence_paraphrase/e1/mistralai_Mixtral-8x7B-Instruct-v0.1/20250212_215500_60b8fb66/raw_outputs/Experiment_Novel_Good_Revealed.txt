 I would rate this paragraph a 5 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph does provide some tension with the mention of the young patient's critical condition, it lacks the build-up and context necessary to create a strong sense of suspense. The paragraph simply states that the helicopter carrying the organ arrived on time, without providing any information about the challenges or obstacles that the medical team might have faced in obtaining the organ or transporting it to the hospital. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included more details about the risks and uncertainties involved in the organ transplant process.

 I would rate this paragraph a 7 out of 9 for suspensefulness. The paragraph effectively creates a sense of urgency and tension with the use of vivid and specific details, such as the sound of the helicopter blades and the temperature of the liver in the blue case. The actions of the two men, particularly the one carrying the liver, are described in a way that conveys a sense of urgency and importance. The paragraph also includes a hint of danger, with the mention of the spinning blades and the need to move quickly. However, the paragraph could be even more suspenseful if it provided more context about the patient's condition and the risks involved in the transplant. 

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and effectively builds tension, but it could benefit from a bit more context and background information to fully immerse the reader in the story.

 I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 9 for suspensefulness. While the paragraph provides some interesting details about the cleaner's daily routine, it does not create a sense of tension or urgency. The paragraph focuses on the mundane tasks of the cleaner, without any mention of the main story about the liver transplant. The only possible connection to the main story is the mention of the service stairwell, but this is not developed or explored in a way that creates suspense.

To increase the suspense, the paragraph could have included some hints or foreshadowing about the importance of the service stairwell or the potential risks involved in using it. For example, the paragraph could have mentioned that the service stairwell was usually locked or that it was not recommended for use by hospital staff. This would create a sense of mystery and intrigue, making the reader wonder why the cleaner was using the stairwell and what might happen as a result.

Overall, the paragraph is well-written and provides some interesting details about the cleaner's job, but it does not contribute to the suspense of the main story.
