I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Intriguing Premise:**  The opening line about a real event immediately grabs attention. 
* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child's life hangs in the balance, and time is running out.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends with "This is the story of what happened," leaving the reader wanting to know the outcome.

**What's Missing:**

* **Sensory Details:** The paragraph lacks vivid descriptions that could heighten the tension. We don't feel the urgency of the situation or the emotional weight of the moment.
* **Internal Conflict:**  While we know Robert is in danger, we don't get a sense of his feelings or the internal struggle of the medical team.


To increase the suspense, the author could:

* Describe the hospital environment – the sterile atmosphere, the hushed voices, the beeping machines.
* Show Robert's fear or hope.
* Reveal the medical team's anxieties and doubts.

* Hint at potential problems – bad weather, traffic delays, technical difficulties.

Here's why:

* **Heightened Sensory Details:** The description of the helicopter's rotors, the wind, and the men's actions creates a vivid and immersive experience.

I'd rate this paragraph a **2/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Mundane Description:** The paragraph focuses on the routine and uneventful nature of the cleaner's job. There's no sense of danger, mystery, or urgency.
* **Lack of Conflict:**  The cleaner faces no obstacles or challenges. His day is described as "agreeable" and "typical."
* **Passive Voice:** The frequent use of passive voice ("the floor was mopped," "the cleaning trolley was collected") further contributes to the lack of tension.

**To increase suspense, the author could:**

* **Introduce an anomaly:**  Perhaps the cleaner notices something unusual in the stairwell, like a misplaced object or a strange sound.
* **Hint at a threat:**  The cleaner could overhear a conversation or witness something that suggests danger.
* **Create a sense of unease:**  Use vivid descriptions and sensory details to create a feeling of discomfort or foreboding.



As it stands, the paragraph is more of a slice-of-life vignette than a suspenseful piece.
