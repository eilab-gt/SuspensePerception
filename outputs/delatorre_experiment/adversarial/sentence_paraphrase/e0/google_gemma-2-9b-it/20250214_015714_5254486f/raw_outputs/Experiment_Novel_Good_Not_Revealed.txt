I'd rate this paragraph a **6/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **High Stakes:** The situation is clearly dire – a child's life hangs in the balance, and time is running out.
* **Cliffhanger Ending:** The paragraph ends with "This is the story of what happened," leaving the reader wanting to know the outcome.

**What's Missing:**

* **Sensory Details:** The paragraph lacks vivid descriptions that could heighten the tension. We don't feel the urgency or the fear in the hospital.

* **Internal Conflict:**  Adding thoughts or feelings from Robert or the doctors could create a more palpable sense of anxiety.


Overall, the paragraph sets up a suspenseful situation, but it could be even more gripping with more sensory details and emotional depth.

I'd rate this paragraph a **4/9** on the suspensefulness scale. 

Here's why:

* **Resolution:** The paragraph provides a clear resolution to the tension built up in the previous paragraphs. We learn that the liver is functioning correctly, removing the immediate threat.

* **Emotional Resonance:**  Explore the reactions of the medical team and Robert's family to the news.
* **Sensory Details:** Add descriptions of the hospital environment, the sounds of medical equipment, or the atmosphere of relief in the room.
