 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty about Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "critical situation" and the mention of the "entire medical team" adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it provided more details about Robert's condition or the challenges the medical team might face during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the mention of the helicopter landing at a specific time, but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ or the helicopter ride, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant.

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds a sense of urgency and importance to the organ with the mention of the helicopter and the "small blue fridge" that stores the liver. The use of the word "fully functioning" also suggests that the liver is precious and vital to Robert's survival. However, the paragraph could be more suspenseful if it hinted at potential complications or challenges that could arise during the transplant, or if it provided more details about the men who descended from the helicopter.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 3 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph does not add much to the overall suspense of the story and seems to be a tangential detail that does not contribute to the tension or drama. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be removed or rewritten to focus more on the medical team's preparations or Robert's condition.  ​

  I would rate this paragraph as a 4 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of movement and action, but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could be rewritten to focus more on the urgency of the situation or the potential challenges that the men might face while transporting the liver down the service stairwell.  ​  ​

   I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph introduces a sudden and unexpected event that creates a sense of tension and suspense. The use of the word "plunged" adds a sense of danger and urgency, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to the liver and Robert's chances of survival. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the consequences of the accident or the medical team's reaction to it.  ​  ​  ​  ​
