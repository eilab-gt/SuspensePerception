 I would rate this paragraph as a 7 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph sets up a tense and critical situation with the impending liver transplant and the uncertainty of Robert's survival. The use of the phrase "his situation was critical" adds to the suspense, as does the mention of the "entire medical team" and the "suitable donor."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 5 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph provides a sense of urgency with the mention of the helicopter landing "punctually," but it does not add much to the overall suspense of the story. To increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the organ or the helicopter ride, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant.  For example, "At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition. As the medical team rushed to unload the organ, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as they knew that every second counted."

 I would rate this paragraph as a 6 on the 9-point scale. The paragraph adds a sense of urgency with the mention of the "two men" and the "small blue fridge," which stores the "fully functioning liver."

However, to increase the suspense, the paragraph could provide more details about the men or the organ, or it could hint at potential complications that could arise during the transplant. For example, "Two men descended from the helicopter, one of whom was carrying a small blue fridge, in the shape of a case, which stored the fully functioning liver. As the medical team watched, the man carefully opened the fridge, revealing the organ that would save Robert's life. But as they prepared to transfer the liver, they noticed a small crack in the container, causing a wave of panic to sweep over the room."
