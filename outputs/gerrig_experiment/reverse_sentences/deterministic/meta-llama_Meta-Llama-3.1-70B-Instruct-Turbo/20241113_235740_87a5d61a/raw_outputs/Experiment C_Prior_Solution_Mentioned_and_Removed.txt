***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and is being subjected to physical torture, the fact that he is a skilled secret agent and has managed to outwit Blofeld in the past (by causing him to lose a considerable amount of money) suggests that he may still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful, as it describes a tense and violent scene in which Bond is being held captive and tortured by Blofeld's henchmen. The use of vivid language and imagery, such as the description of the bird crashing into the glass wall and the sound of the gun being fired, creates a sense of urgency and danger. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being subjected to physical torture and is at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of tension and suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
