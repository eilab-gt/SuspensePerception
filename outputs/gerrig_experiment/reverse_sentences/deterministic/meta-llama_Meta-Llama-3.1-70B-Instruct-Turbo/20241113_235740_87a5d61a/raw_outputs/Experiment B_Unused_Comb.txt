***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the passage suggests that Bond is unharmed and still agile, which implies that he may be able to find an opportunity to escape. Additionally, Bond's character is known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet, which increases the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful as it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The use of action-packed language, such as "drawn guns", "leapt men", and "shove well-placed", adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. The fact that Bond is currently helpless and "impotent" also increases the tension, making the reader eager to find out what happens next.
