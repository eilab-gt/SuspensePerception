***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, the passage suggests that Bond is resourceful and quick-thinking, as evidenced by his attempt to attack Le Chiffre and his subsequent efforts to right himself and move his pen fountain into a deeper pocket. This implies that Bond is likely to try to escape, and his skills and experience may give him an advantage in doing so.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful, as it describes a tense and violent confrontation between Bond and Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of vivid and dynamic language, such as "hurled himself", "whistle of pain", "shins connected", and "slammed himself against the wall", creates a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is a prisoner and is being searched and disarmed adds to the tension, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next
