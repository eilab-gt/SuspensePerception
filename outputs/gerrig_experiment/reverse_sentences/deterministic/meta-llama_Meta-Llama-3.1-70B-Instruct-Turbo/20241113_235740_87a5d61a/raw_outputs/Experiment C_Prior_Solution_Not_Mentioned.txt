***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen, the fact that he has already managed to cause significant financial losses for Blofeld and has shown quick thinking in attempting to escape (as seen in the additional passage), suggests that he is a resourceful and skilled operative. Given Bond's character and the typical plot progression of James Bond novels, it is likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and subjected to physical torture. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the wire being twisted into Bond's flesh, creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes for the protagonist. The fact that Blofeld is in control and seems to be enjoying Bond's suffering adds to the sense of danger and unpredictability, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
