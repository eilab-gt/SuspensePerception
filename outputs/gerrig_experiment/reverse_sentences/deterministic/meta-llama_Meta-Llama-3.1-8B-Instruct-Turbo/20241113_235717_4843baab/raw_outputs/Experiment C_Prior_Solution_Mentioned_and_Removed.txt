***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a precarious situation. He is a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being subjected to physical torture. The fact that he is pinned to a chair with wire and being twisted painfully suggests that his situation is dire. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "Not very likely" (1).

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite intense and dramatic, with Bond being subjected to physical torture and psychological manipulation by Blofeld. The use of vivid language and the description of the scene creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is being subjected to pain and humiliation makes the reader feel a sense of unease and concern for his well-being. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as "Extremely suspenseful" (7).
