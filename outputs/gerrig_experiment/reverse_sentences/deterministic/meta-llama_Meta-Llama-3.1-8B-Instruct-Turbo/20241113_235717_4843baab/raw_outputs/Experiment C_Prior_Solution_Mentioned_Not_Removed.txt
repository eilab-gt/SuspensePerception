***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He is a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being subjected to physical torture. The fact that he is pinned to a chair with wire and being twisted painfully suggests that he is at a disadvantage. Therefore, I would say that it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer: 1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being held captive and subjected to physical torture. The use of words like "gun", "shot", "crashed", "stumbled", and "painfully" creates a sense of danger and urgency. The fact that Bond is being held by a villainous character like Blofeld, who is known for his cunning and ruthlessness, adds to the suspense. Additionally, the passage leaves the reader wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape. Therefore, I would say that this passage is very suspenseful.
