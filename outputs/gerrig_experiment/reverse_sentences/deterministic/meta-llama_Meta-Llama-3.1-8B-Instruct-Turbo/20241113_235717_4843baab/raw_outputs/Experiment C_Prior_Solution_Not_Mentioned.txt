***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult situation, being pinned down by wire and being forced to endure pain. Blofeld and his accomplice, Crushak, seem to be in control, and there is no indication of an immediate escape plan. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "Not very likely" (option 1).

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite intense and action-packed, with Bond being pinned down, forced to endure pain, and being spoken to by Blofeld in a menacing tone. The use of vivid descriptions and the situation's gravity contribute to a sense of tension and suspense. I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as "Extremely suspenseful" (option 7).
