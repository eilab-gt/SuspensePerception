 Based on the information provided in the passage, it appears that Bond and Vesper are currently being held captive by Blofeld and his henchmen. Blofeld has taken them to his office, where he has bound and gagged Bond with wire. Blofeld seems to be enjoying the situation and taunting Bond, indicating that he has no intention of releasing them anytime soon.

Given this information, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld in the immediate future. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 would be "Not very likely."

As for Question 2, the passage is quite suspenseful. The fact that Bond and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Blofeld's office and his interactions with Bond add to the tension and keep the reader engaged. Therefore, the answer to Question 2 would be "Moderately suspenseful."
