 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Bond and Vesper are currently the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being held in a room with no apparent way out. Additionally, Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, and it is unclear how Bond will be able to overcome this obstacle.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there is no immediate danger to Bond or Vesper, the fact that they are being held captive by a criminal figure and there is no apparent way out creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The passage also includes elements of danger and violence, as Le Chiffre and his gunmen are armed and ready to use force if necessary. Overall, the passage is suspenseful, but not extremely so.
