Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past.  The excerpt hints at Bond's attempt to use the distraction to his advantage, suggesting he's not going down without a fight. However, he's outnumbered and restrained, making a clean escape unlikely.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is captured, Blofeld is clearly menacing, and the description of the scene (gun pointed, wire wrapping around Bond's arms) builds anticipation.  We know Bond is in trouble, but the excerpt doesn't reveal his immediate fate, leaving the reader wanting to know what happens next.
