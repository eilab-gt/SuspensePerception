Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently bound and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen.  The passage highlights Bond's initial attempt to escape, which was quickly thwarted.  Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken steps to ensure Bond's capture.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. We know Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and restrained.  Blofeld's menacing tone and the description of Bond's capture add to the suspense. However, it's not yet a high-stakes, heart-pounding level of suspense.
