The passage is somewhat suspenseful. It describes the events of Bond's capture in a way that is both exciting and suspenseful. However, the passage is not as suspenseful as some other James Bond novels. This is because the plot is relatively straightforward and the characters are not as well developed as they are in some other novels.
