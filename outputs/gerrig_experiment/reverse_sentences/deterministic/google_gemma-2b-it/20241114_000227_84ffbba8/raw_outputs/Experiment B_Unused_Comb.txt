The passage is somewhat suspenseful. The events that unfold are interesting and engaging, but the pacing of the story is a bit slow in the beginning. The suspense builds gradually as Bond and Vesper are trapped and as Le Chiffre lays a trap for him. The passage is also somewhat predictable, as Bond's eventual escape is almost guaranteed.
