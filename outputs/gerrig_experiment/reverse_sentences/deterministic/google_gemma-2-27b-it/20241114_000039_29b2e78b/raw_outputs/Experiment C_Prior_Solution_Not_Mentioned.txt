Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

While Bond shows some cunning by initially taking advantage of the distraction, he is quickly overpowered and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and is clearly not someone to be underestimated. However, Bond is resourceful and has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and at the mercy of a dangerous and cunning villain. The descriptions of Blofeld's actions and demeanor add to the sense of unease and danger. The ending, with Bond restrained and Blofeld threatening further unpleasantries, leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, eager to know what will happen next.
