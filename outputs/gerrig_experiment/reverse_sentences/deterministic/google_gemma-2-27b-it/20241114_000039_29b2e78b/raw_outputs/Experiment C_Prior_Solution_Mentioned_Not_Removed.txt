Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

While Bond shows some cunning by initially taking advantage of the distraction, he is quickly overpowered and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and prepared for Bond's tricks. However, Bond is resourceful and has escaped dangerous situations before, so a complete escape seems unlikely at this point, but not impossible.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and physically restrained. Blofeld's calm demeanor and threats create a sense of danger. The description of Crushak's actions and Bond's pain adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
