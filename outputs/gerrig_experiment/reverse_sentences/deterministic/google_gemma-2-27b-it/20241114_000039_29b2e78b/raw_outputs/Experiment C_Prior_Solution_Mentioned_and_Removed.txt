Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

While Bond shows some cunning by initially taking advantage of the distraction, he is quickly overpowered and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken precautions. However, this is a James Bond story, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape seemingly impossible situations.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the description of Bond's capture, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's cold and calculating demeanor. The fact that Bond is restrained and seemingly at Blofeld's mercy adds to the tension. However, the passage lacks a clear sense of immediate danger or a ticking clock, which would elevate the suspense further.
