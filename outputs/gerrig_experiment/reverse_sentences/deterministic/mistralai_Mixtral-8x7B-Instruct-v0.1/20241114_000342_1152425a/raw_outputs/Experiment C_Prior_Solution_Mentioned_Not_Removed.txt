 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld, as the outcome of their encounter is not revealed in the text. However, considering Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, one might lean towards options 5, 6, or 7, suggesting that he has a moderate, very, or extremely high likelihood of escaping.

Answer Question 2: The suspense level in this passage can be subjective and may vary among readers. However, given that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, and the excerpt describes a tense and potentially dangerous situation, one could argue that the passage is at least moderately suspenseful (option 5). The use of descriptive language and the depiction of Bond's predicament contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
