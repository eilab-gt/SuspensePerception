 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not contain any information about Bond's plans or capabilities to escape. However, considering Bond's history in the series, it is plausible to assume that he may have a plan to escape from difficult situations, so one could rate it as "moderately likely" (5) that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, creating a sense of suspense for the reader. However, the excerpt does not contain any action or dialogue that significantly heightens the suspense, so it can be rated as "somewhat suspenseful" (2).
