Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that their situation is quite dire and escape seems unlikely at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors, and the description of their situation is vivid and intense. The use of words like "gun", "gunman", "painfully", and "twist" creates a sense of fear and unease, making the reader feel on edge and eager to know what will happen next.
