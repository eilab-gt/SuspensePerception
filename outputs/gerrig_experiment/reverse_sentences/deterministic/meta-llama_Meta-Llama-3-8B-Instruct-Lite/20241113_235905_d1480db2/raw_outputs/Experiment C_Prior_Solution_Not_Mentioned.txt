Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that they are in a difficult and precarious situation. The fact that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond and has him pinned to a chair, with wire wrapped around his arms and legs, makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is being held captive by a villainous character. The use of descriptive language, such as "crashed into the glass of the wall", "stumbled backwards", and "painfully more bit wire the of twist" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is in a vulnerable position, with no clear way to escape, adds to the suspense. The passage also creates a sense of unease and fear, as the reader is aware that Bond is at the mercy of a ruthless and cunning villain.
