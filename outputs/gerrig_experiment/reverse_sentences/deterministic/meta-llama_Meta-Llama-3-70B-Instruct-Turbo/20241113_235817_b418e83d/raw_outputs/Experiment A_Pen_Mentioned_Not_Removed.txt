***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from tight spots. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape, so I'm neutral on this question.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and action, with Bond being captured, rough-handled, and threatened by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons", "whistle of pain", "sharply twisted", and "Corsican lightning" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next, which makes the passage very suspenseful.
