Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is intense and dramatic, with Bond and Vesper trapped and helpless. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "weary grow", "crashed bird", and "irritations such eliminating to devoted is" creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive.
