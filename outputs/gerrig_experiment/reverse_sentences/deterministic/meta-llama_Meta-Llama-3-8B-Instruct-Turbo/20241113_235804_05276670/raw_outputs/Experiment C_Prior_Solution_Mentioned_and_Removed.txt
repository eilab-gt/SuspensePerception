Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. The situation seems dire, and it's unclear how Bond will manage to escape, especially since he's being pinned down by wire and forced to remain still. The odds of escape seem low at this point.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is incredibly tense and suspenseful, with Bond and Vesper trapped and helpless against Blofeld's gunmen. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "weary grow", "crashed bird", and "irritations such eliminating to devoted is" creates a sense of unease and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being pinned down and forced to remain still adds to the sense of desperation and hopelessness, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
