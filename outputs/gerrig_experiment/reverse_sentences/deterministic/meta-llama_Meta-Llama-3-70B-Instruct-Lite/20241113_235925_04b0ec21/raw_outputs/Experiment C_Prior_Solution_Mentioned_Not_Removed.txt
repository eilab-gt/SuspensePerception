***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond is a skilled agent, he is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, which puts him at a disadvantage. However, Bond's past experiences and abilities suggest that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's precarious situation, with Blofeld and his gunmen holding him captive. The use of vivid language, such as "pinned carefully and chair arm wooden a into Bond forced" and "flesh Bond's into painfully more bit wire the of twist subsequent", adds to the sense of danger and discomfort. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate, making the reader wonder if he will escape or suffer further harm, which contributes to the suspense.
