***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from tight spots. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape, so I would remain neutral or uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being captured and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "spidery" summons, the "crooked" finger, and the " Corsican's lightning-like" movement, adds to the sense of tension and danger. The passage effectively conveys a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen to Bond next, making it very suspenseful.
