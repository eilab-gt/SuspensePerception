***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond is a skilled agent, he is currently pinned to a chair and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, Bond's past experiences and abilities suggest that he might find a way to escape, but it's unclear at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of vivid language, such as "wire piano of piece a wrapping by place in Bond pinned carefully and chair arm wooden a into Bond forced", creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, which creates a sense of suspense.
