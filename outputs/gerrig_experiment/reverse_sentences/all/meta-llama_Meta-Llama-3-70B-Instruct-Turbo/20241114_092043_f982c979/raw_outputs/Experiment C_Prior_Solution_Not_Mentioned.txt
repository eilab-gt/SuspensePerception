Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond is a skilled agent, he is currently pinned to a chair and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, Bond's past experiences and abilities suggest that he might find a way to escape, but it's unclear at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The descriptions of Blofeld's and Crushak's actions, such as wrapping wire around Bond's arms and twisting it painfully, create a vivid and unsettling image. The dialogue also adds to the suspense, with Blofeld's menacing tone and Bond's precarious situation making the reader wonder what will happen next.
