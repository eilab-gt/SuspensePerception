Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with Blofeld and his gunmen having the upper hand. However, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's difficult to predict whether he will escape or not. The passage doesn't provide enough information to make a confident assessment of Bond's chances of escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive and subjected to physical harm. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the wire being twisted painfully into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of suspense. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond also contributes to the tension, as it's clear that Blofeld is determined to harm Bond and Bond is trying to stay calm and think of a way to escape. Overall, the passage effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged.
