 Based on the provided excerpt, it appears that Bond and Vesper are currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Le Chiffre has taken Bond's wallet and weapons, and is searching the room for any hidden weapons or information. Bond has managed to escape from Le Chiffre's grasp once, but was quickly overpowered again.

Given this information, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen at this moment. There are too many adversaries, and Bond is currently unarmed and outnumbered.

As for Question 2, the passage is quite suspenseful. The description of Le Chiffre's actions and Bond's attempts to escape create a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to overpower his captors or if he will be discovered and captured again. The use of descriptive language and the back-and-forth nature of the scene add to the suspense.
