 Based on the information provided in the passage, it appears that Bond's situation is quite dire, and he and Vesper are currently prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Le Chiffre has the upper hand and has disarmed Bond, so it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 would be "Not very likely."

As for Question 2, the passage is quite suspenseful due to the dangerous situation Bond finds himself in. The tension is heightened by Le Chiffre's threatening demeanor and the fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned. The passage also includes several action-packed moments, such as Bond being shot at and trying to escape, which add to the suspense. Therefore, the answer to Question 2 would be "Very suspenseful."
