 Based on the information provided in the passage, it appears that Bond's situation is quite dire, as he and Vesper are currently prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Le Chiffre has the upper hand at the moment, and Bond's attempts to resist have been unsuccessful. Therefore, I would answer Question 1 with the following:

1. Not very likely

As for Question 2, the passage is quite suspenseful due to the danger that Bond and Vesper are in and the uncertainty of their fate. The tension is heightened by the fact that Bond has previously bested Le Chiffre at the baccarat table, only to be outmaneuvered and captured. I would answer Question 2 with the following:

5. Moderately suspenseful

However, it's important to note that the passage only provides a snapshot of the situation, and the outcome of Bond's predicament is not revealed. The full context of the novel may offer additional information that could impact the level of suspense.
