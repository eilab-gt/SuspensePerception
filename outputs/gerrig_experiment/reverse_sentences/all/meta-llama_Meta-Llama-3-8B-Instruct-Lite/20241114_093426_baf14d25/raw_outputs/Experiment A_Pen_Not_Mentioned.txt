Based on the passage, I would answer:

Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and there is no indication of a clear plan for their escape. In fact, Le Chiffre has taken Bond's gun and is allowing his men to search him, making it seem like a long shot that Bond will be able to escape.

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tension and suspense, with Bond and Vesper in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "spidery, silent a in Bond at finger a crooked", "Corsican the lightning", and "gunmen two the to possible as damage much as do to was plan His" creates a sense of urgency and danger, drawing the reader into the story and making it hard to put down.
