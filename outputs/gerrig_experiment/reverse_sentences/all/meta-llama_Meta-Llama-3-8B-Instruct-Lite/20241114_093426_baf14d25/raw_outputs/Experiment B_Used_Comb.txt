Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage indicates that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Bond has been caught and subdued. This suggests that the situation is dire for Bond, and he is unlikely to escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes Bond's capture and the ominous tone of the scene. The use of phrases such as "trapped was he but, unharmed was Bond" and "impotent and puny felt Bond" creates a sense of tension and vulnerability. The fact that Bond is in a precarious situation and is being confronted by his captor, Le Chiffre, adds to the suspense. The scene is intense and foreboding, making it extremely suspenseful.
