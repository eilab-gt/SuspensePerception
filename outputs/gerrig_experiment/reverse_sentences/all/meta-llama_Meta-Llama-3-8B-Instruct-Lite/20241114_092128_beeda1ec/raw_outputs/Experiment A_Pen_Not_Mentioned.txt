Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage indicates that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which suggests that they are in a difficult and precarious situation. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond and has the upper hand makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a difficult situation, and the description of the scene, including the use of words like "silence", "spidery", "hurried", and "brusquely", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is being dragged away by the gunmen and is being searched for weapons also creates a sense of fear and helplessness. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
