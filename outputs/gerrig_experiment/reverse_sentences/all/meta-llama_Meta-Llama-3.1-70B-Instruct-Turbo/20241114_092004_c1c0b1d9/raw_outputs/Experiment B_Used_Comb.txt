***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would rate this as 6. Very likely. 

Although Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the passage does not suggest that he is seriously injured or that his situation is hopeless. Bond's ability to right himself after being kicked and his agility in rolling to the ground also imply that he is still capable of taking action. Given that this is a James Bond novel, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape from his predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate this as 7. Extremely suspenseful. 

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's sudden capture by Le Chiffre's gunmen and his subsequent helplessness. The use of action verbs like "burst", "leapt", "shove", and "twisted" creates a sense of urgency and chaos. Additionally, the fact that Bond is now at the mercy of his enemy and is being searched and disarmed adds to the sense of suspense and raises questions about what will happen to him next.
