***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the situation described, where Bond is a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and is being physically restrained and tortured by Crushak, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as follows:

6. Very likely

This answer might seem counterintuitive given the dire circumstances, but it's essential to consider the character of James Bond and the typical narrative of the series. Bond often finds himself in precarious situations, only to use his wit, cunning, and resourcefulness to escape and ultimately triumph over his adversaries.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage provided, I would rate the suspense level as follows:

7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a high level of tension and suspense by describing Bond's desperate situation, the brutality of Crushak's actions, and Blofeld's menacing tone. The use of vivid imagery, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the sound of the gun being fired, adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The passage effectively conveys the idea that Bond's life is in grave danger, making it extremely suspenseful.
