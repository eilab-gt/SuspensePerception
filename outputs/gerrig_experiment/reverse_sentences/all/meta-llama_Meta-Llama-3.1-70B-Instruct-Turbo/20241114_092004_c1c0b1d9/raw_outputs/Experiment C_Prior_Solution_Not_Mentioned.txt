***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, Bond is in a precarious situation, being pinned to a chair with piano wire and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. However, given the character of James Bond and the typical plot progression of a Bond novel, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as:

6. Very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of vivid and violent language, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall, the gun being knocked out of Blofeld's hand, and the piano wire being twisted into Bond's flesh, creates a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape this situation, which adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as:

7. Extremely suspenseful
