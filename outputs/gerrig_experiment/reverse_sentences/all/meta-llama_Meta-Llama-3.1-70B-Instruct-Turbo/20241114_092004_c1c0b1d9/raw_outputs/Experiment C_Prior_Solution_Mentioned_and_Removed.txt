***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would say the answer is: 6. Very likely.

This is because, despite being pinned to a chair and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, Bond has consistently demonstrated his ability to think on his feet and escape from difficult situations. Additionally, the fact that Blofeld is taking the time to taunt and monologue suggests that he may be underestimating Bond, which could ultimately prove to be his downfall.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would say the answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful.

The passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, from the bird crashing into the glass wall to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and is being subjected to physical torture, creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape, and whether he will be able to outwit his captors once again.
