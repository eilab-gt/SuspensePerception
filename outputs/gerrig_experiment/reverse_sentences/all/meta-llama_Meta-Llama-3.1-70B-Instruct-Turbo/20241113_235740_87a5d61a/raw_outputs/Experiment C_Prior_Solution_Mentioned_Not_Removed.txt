***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and it is typical of the series for him to find ways to escape from difficult situations. Although the passage describes Bond being pinned to a chair with wire and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape or turn the tables on his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and subjected to physical pain. The presence of Blofeld and his henchmen adds to the sense of danger, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as the image of the wire being twisted into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
