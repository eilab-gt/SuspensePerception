***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the passage suggests that Bond is unharmed and still agile. Additionally, Bond's character is known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet. Given these traits, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful as it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of action-packed language, such as "drawn guns", "leapt men", and "sharply it twisted", adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.
