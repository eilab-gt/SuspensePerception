**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as "6. Very likely." This is because Bond is shown to be agile, resilient, and capable of thinking on his feet, as demonstrated by his reaction to the sudden attack by the gunmen. Additionally, Bond's character as a secret agent implies that he has the skills and training to handle difficult situations, which increases the likelihood of his escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
I would rate the suspense level of the passage as "6. Very suspenseful." The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency through the sudden and violent attack on Bond, as well as the cat-and-mouse game between Bond and Le Chiffre. The use of words like "burst", "sharply", and "suddenly" adds to the sense of rapid action and danger, keeping the reader on edge.
