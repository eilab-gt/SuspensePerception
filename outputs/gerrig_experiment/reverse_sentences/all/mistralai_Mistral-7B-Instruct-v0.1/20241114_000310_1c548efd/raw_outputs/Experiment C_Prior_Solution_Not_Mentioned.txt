 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. Blofeld has successfully captured Bond and Vesper and has them as his prisoners. He has also set up a series of traps and obstacles to prevent Bond from escaping. Additionally, Blofeld is a skilled and cunning criminal mastermind who is not easily defeated.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. The situation is tense and dangerous for Bond and Vesper, who are being held captive by a dangerous criminal. The traps and obstacles that Blofeld has set up add to the suspense, as does the fact that Blofeld is a skilled and cunning criminal mastermind. However, the passage is not extremely suspenseful, as there are no major plot twists or unexpected events.
