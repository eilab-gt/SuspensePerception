 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Bond and Vesper are currently the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being held in a room at a hotel. Le Chiffre has expressed his intention to search Bond thoroughly, and it is unclear how Bond will be able to escape from the situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. The situation is tense, as Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The passage also hints at the danger that Bond is in, as Le Chiffre has expressed his intention to search him thoroughly and there is a possibility that Bond may be injured in the process. However, the passage does not provide enough information to determine the level of suspense fully.
