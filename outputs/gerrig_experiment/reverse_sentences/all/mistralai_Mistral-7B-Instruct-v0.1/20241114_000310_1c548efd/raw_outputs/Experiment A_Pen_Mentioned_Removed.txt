 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it is unclear how they will be able to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. The situation that Bond and Vesper find themselves in is dangerous, and it is unclear how they will be able to escape. The use of phrases such as "spidery," "silent," "sharply," "arc," and "damage minimal" add to the suspenseful atmosphere of the passage.
