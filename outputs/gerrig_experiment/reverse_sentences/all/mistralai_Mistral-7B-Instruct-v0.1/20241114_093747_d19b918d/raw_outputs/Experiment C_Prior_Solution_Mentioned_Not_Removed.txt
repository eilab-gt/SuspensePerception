 The passage seems to indicate that James Bond and Vesper are in a difficult situation, as they have been captured by Blofeld and his gunmen. Blofeld appears to be a dangerous and unpredictable criminal, and it is unclear how Bond and Vesper will manage to escape. As such, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 3 out of 7, which is somewhat likely.

In terms of suspense, I would rate the passage as 5 out of 7, which is moderately suspenseful. The passage describes Blofeld as a dangerous and unpredictable criminal, and it is unclear how Bond and Vesper will manage to escape. The use of language, such as "advantage took Bond," and "pinned carefully" adds to the suspense.
