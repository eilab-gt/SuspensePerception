The passage is somewhat suspenseful. The events that unfold are interesting and engaging, but the pacing is a bit slow in the beginning. The suspense builds gradually as Bond and Vesper are trapped and as Le Chiffre lays a trap for him. The passage is also very suspenseful because of the unexpected twist at the end.
