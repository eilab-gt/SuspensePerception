The passage is somewhat suspenseful. It describes Bond's encounter with Blofeld and his two gunmen, and it suggests that Bond is in danger. However, the passage is not as suspenseful as some of the other Bond novels. This is because the action is relatively simple and the characters are not as well developed.
