Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given the situation where Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point. He and Vesper are at the mercy of their captors, and Le Chiffre has a clear upper hand.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors, and the vivid descriptions of the scene create a sense of urgency and danger. The use of words like "spidery", "silent", "hurried", and "whistled" adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
