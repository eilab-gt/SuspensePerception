Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. Bond is pinned to a chair with wire, and it seems that their situation is quite dire. Given these circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, and that Blofeld has the upper hand. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large, ugly, very large" man, and the "painfully more bit wire" that Bond is being forced to endure, adds to the sense of suspense. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia, with Bond being pinned to a chair and unable to move. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next.
