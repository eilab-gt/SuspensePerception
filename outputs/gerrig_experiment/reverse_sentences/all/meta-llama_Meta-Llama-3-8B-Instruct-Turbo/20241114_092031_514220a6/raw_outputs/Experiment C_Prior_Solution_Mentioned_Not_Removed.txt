Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive in a situation that seems to be under Blofeld's control. Bond's attempts to escape seem to be foiled, and he is being subjected to physical torture. The situation appears to be dire for Bond, making it unlikely that he will escape.

The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, and the tension is heightened by the use of vivid descriptions of the setting and the actions of the characters. The passage is also full of surprises, with unexpected twists and turns that keep the reader on edge. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of suspense and keep the reader engaged.
