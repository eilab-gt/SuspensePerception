Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being dragged away. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim, and he is at the mercy of his captors.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is full of intense and vivid descriptions of Bond's situation, from the "spidery, silent" summons from Le Chiffre to the "Corsican lightning" that crashes Bond to the ground. The use of words like "hurled", "slammed", and "crashed" creates a sense of urgency and danger, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next. The passage is expertly crafted to build tension and suspense, making it extremely suspenseful.
