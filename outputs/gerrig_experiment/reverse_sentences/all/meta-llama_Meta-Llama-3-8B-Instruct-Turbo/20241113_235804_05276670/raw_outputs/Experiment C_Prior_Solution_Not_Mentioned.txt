Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive in a room. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is intense and dramatic, with Bond and Vesper being held captive and Blofeld's menacing tone and actions creating a sense of tension and danger. The use of vivid descriptions and the sudden twists and turns in the scene keep the reader on edge, making it an extremely suspenseful passage.
