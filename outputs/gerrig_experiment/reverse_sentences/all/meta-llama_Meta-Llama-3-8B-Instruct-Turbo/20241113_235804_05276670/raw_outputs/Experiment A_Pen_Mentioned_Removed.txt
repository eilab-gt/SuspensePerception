Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being dragged away. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim, at least for the moment.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is full of intense and vivid descriptions of Bond's actions, and the situation is extremely dire. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and the tension is palpable. The use of phrases like "Corsican the lightning Like", "pain of whistle a brought and shins man's thin the with connected which kick backward a", and "attentively work assistant's his observed Chiffre Le" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
