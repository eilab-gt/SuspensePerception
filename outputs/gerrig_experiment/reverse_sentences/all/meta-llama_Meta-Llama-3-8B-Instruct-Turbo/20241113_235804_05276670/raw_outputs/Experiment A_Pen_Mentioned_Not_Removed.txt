Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which doesn't look promising for their escape. Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, and they are being dragged away. It's unlikely that Bond will escape from this situation without some kind of plan or help.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and it's unclear what will happen to them next. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "spidery", "silent", "Corsican lightning", and "unquiet" creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and the suspense is heightened by the uncertainty of their fate.
