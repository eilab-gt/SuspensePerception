Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and disarmed, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled. The fact that he "took great pride" in righting himself after being knocked down suggests he won't give up easily.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond is caught off guard, overpowered, and disarmed. Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and mocking tone add to the sense of danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
