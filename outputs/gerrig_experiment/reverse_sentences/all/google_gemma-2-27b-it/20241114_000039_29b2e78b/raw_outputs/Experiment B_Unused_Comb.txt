Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Explanation:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's also shown to be resourceful and skilled. The excerpt ends with him feeling "impotent and puny," suggesting a setback, but not necessarily defeat.  We don't have enough information to say whether he'll escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Explanation:** The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, disarmed, and clearly outmatched. The descriptions of the gunmen's actions and Bond's own feelings of helplessness create a strong sense of danger and uncertainty. The ending, with Chiffre's taunting smile, leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, eager to know what happens next.
