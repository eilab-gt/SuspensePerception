Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

* **Reasoning:** While Bond shows quick thinking and manages to momentarily disarm Blofeld, he's quickly overpowered by Crushak. He's now bound and at the mercy of Blofeld. Escaping from this situation seems challenging, but Bond is resourceful and has a history of defying the odds.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful** 

* **Reasoning:** The passage is packed with action and tension: Bond's daring move against Blofeld, the sudden shift in power dynamics with Crushak's intervention, and Bond being tied up create a sense of uncertainty and impending danger. The threat of further violence and Blofeld's chilling demeanor add to the suspense.
