Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond shows resourcefulness and quick thinking (kicking the gunman, using the pen), he's clearly in a precarious situation. He's disarmed, outnumbered, and facing a cunning opponent.  His escape seems possible, given his skills, but not highly probable.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is filled with action and tension. The descriptions of Bond's quick movements, the threat from the gunmen, and Le Chiffre's cold demeanor create a palpable sense of danger and uncertainty.  The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
