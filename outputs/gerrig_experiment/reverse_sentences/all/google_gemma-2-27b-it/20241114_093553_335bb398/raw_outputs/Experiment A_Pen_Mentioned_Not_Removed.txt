Here are my answers based on the provided passage:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely**

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting skill, he's outnumbered and disarmed. The situation seems perilous, but Bond's resourcefulness and history as a spy suggest he might find a way out, even if it's not guaranteed.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

 **6. Very suspenseful** 

The passage is written with a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is captured, beaten, and disarmed. The descriptions of the violence ("kick backward," "slammed against the wall," "gun trained") create a tense atmosphere.  The uncertainty of Bond's fate keeps the reader on edge.
