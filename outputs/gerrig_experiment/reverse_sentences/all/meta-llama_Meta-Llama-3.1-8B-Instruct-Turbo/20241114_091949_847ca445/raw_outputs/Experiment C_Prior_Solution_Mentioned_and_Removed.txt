**Answer to Question 1:**
Given that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld without some sort of external intervention. Blofeld has already laid a successful trap for Bond, and he has also managed to overpower Bond physically, as evidenced by the wire wrapping around Bond's arms and the subsequent twisting of the wire. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld is low.

The answer is: 1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
This passage is quite suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being held captive by Blofeld and his men. The use of action-packed sentences, such as "out knocking, air the into up shot gun his and backwards stumbled Blofeld" and "wire the of twist subsequent Each done was he that indicate to grunted Crushak", creates a sense of urgency and danger. Additionally, the conversation between Bond and Blofeld, where Bond is being mocked and taunted, adds to the tension and suspense. The overall atmosphere of the passage is one of high stakes and uncertainty, making it a suspenseful read.

The answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful
