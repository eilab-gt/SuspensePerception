***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He has been captured by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it's clear that they have the upper hand. The fact that Bond is being dragged by his feet, his revolver is being taken away, and Le Chiffre is ordering his assistant to search Bond suggests that the odds are against him. Therefore, I would say that it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer: 1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite suspenseful. The action is fast-paced and intense, with Bond being captured, his gun being taken away, and Le Chiffre's menacing tone. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "spidery, silent" and "Corsican the lightning" creates a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will escape from this predicament. Therefore, I would say that this passage is extremely suspenseful.

Answer: 7. Extremely
