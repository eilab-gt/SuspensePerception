1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is quite vivid and action-packed, with Bond experiencing a series of intense and potentially life-threatening events. The use of descriptive language, such as "spidery, silent" and "Corsican the lightning," creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage also implies that Bond is being subjected to physical harm and humiliation, which adds to the suspense. I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
