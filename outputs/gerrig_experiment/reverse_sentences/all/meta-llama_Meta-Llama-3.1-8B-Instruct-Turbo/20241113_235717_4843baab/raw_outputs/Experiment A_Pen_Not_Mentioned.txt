***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a precarious situation. He has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been dragged to the ground. The fact that Le Chiffre is searching Bond and his assistant is looking for a gun suggests that Bond's chances of escape are low. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite intense and action-packed, with Bond being caught and dragged to the ground, and Le Chiffre's men searching him. The use of vivid and dynamic language, such as "spidery, silent" and "Corsican the lightning", creates a sense of tension and urgency. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape, which adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
