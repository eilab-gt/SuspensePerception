Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, being dragged by Le Chiffre's gunmen and having his revolver stripped from him. This implies that he is currently at a disadvantage and may not have the means to escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond being dragged by the gunmen, his revolver being taken away, and Le Chiffre's menacing tone. The use of vivid and dynamic language, such as "spidery, silent" and "Corsican the lightning", adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
