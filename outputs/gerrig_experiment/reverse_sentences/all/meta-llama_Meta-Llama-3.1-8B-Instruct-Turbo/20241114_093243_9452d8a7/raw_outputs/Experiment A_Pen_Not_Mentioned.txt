***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 
1. Not very likely.

In this passage, it appears that Bond is being dragged by Le Chiffre's gunmen and stripped of his clothes and weapons. This indicates that Bond is currently in a difficult and helpless situation, making his escape unlikely at the moment.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 
7. Extremely suspenseful.

This passage is filled with action, danger, and a sense of urgency, making it a very suspenseful read. The fast-paced descriptions of Bond being kicked, slammed into the wall, and stripped of his revolver create a sense of tension and anxiety, drawing the reader into the situation and making it difficult to put the book down. The sudden twists and turns, such as Bond being dragged by the gunmen and Chiffre's sudden orders, add to the suspense, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.
