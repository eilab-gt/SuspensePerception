***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from tight spots. However, the passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Bond and Vesper as prisoners, and Blofeld and his gunmen in control. The use of descriptive language, such as "pinned carefully and chair arm wooden a into Bond forced" and "flesh Bond's into painfully more bit wire the of twist subsequent", adds to the sense of danger and tension, making the passage very suspenseful.
