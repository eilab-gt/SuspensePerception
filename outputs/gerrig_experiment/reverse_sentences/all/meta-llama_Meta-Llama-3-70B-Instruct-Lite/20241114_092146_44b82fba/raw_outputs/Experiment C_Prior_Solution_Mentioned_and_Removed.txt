***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld, he is a skilled secret agent with a history of escaping from difficult situations. It's likely that he will try to find a way to escape, and his skills and experience make it possible that he will succeed.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful because it describes Bond being trapped and helpless, with Blofeld and his henchmen in control. The use of vivid and violent imagery, such as the wire being twisted into Bond's flesh, creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, which creates a sense of suspense.
