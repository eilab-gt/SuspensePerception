Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond is in a precarious situation, being a prisoner of Blofeld, the passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape. Bond's character is known for his cunning and resourcefulness, but the passage doesn't give any hints about his plans or opportunities for escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the sound of breaking glass and the twisting of wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond also creates a sense of menace and foreboding, making the passage very suspenseful.
