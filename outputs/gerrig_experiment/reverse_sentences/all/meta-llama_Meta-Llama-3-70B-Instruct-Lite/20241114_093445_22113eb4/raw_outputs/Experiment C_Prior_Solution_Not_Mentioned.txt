I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being trapped and helpless in Blofeld's clutches. However, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's uncertain how he will react to this situation. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape, so I'm neutral on this question.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's sinister tone and actions adding to the sense of danger. The use of descriptive language, such as "pointing gun," "pinned carefully," and "twist subsequent" creates a vivid and unsettling image, increasing the sense of suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next, making the passage very suspenseful.
