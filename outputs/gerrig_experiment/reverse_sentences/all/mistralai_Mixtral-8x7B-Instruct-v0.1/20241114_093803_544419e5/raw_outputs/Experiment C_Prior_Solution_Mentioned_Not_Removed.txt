 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not provide enough context regarding Bond's situation or his abilities to escape. Therefore, I would answer "4. Neutral or Uncertain" for this question.

Question 2: The suspense level of a passage depends on the reader's interpretation and engagement with the text. The excerpt provided describes a tense situation with Bond being held captive by Blofeld and his men. The description of Bond being tied to a chair and his captor's intention to harm him creates a suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, based on this excerpt, I would answer "5. Moderately suspenseful" for this question. However, different readers might have different interpretations of the level of suspense in the passage.
