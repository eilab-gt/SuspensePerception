 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not contain any information about the outcome of their encounter.

Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The description of the scene where Bond is surrounded by Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a tense atmosphere, and the reader is left wondering about the fate of the characters. However, without knowing the full context of the scene and its outcome, it is difficult to determine the level of suspense with certainty.
