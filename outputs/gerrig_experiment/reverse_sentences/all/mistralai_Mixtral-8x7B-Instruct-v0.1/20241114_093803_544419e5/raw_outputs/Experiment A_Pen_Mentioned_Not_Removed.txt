 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. There are no details in the passage that indicate the outcome of their encounter.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The description of the swift and violent encounter, with Bond trying to avoid being searched for his weapon, adds to the suspense. Overall, I would rate the suspense level as moderately high. Therefore, I would answer '5. Moderately suspenseful' for Question 2.
