 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. The excerpt does not contain any information about Bond's current situation or any potential plans for escape.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The passage describes a tense situation in which Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, the level of suspense is somewhat mitigated by the fact that Bond has a history of escaping from dangerous situations. Additionally, the passage does not contain any immediate threats to Bond or Vesper's lives, which reduces the overall level of suspense.
