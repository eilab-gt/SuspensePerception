 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it is not specified how Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, so it is difficult to give a precise likelihood. However, given that James Bond is the protagonist of the story and has often found himself in similar situations in other books, it is reasonable to assume that he will eventually escape. Therefore, I would answer "moderately likely" or "5" on the scale provided.

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The description of Bond being caught off guard and forcibly removed from the room, as well as Le Chiffre's intention to do "much damage" to Bond, adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would answer "very suspenseful" or "6" on the scale provided.
