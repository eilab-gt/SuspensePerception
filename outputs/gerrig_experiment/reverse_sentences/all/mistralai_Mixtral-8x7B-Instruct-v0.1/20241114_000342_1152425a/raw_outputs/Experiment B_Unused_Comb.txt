 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. The excerpt does not provide enough context about Bond's current situation or any potential plans for escape.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The description of Bond being trapped and surrounded by Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a tense atmosphere. However, since Bond has faced and overcome numerous challenges in the past, there is also an underlying sense of anticipation that he may find a way to escape once again.
