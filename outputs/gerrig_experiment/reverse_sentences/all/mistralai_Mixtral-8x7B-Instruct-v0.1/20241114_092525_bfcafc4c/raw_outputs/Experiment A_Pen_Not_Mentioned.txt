 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it is not specified how Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, so it is difficult to give a certain probability. However, considering James Bond's character and his reputation for escaping dangerous situations, one might lean towards "moderately likely" or "somewhat likely" that he will find a way to escape.

Answer Question 2: The passage is quite suspenseful. It describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The excerpt details the immediate danger Bond is in, as Le Chiffre has discovered the plan to ruin him and is now searching Bond. The unpredictability of the situation and the immediate threat to Bond's life contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness as "very suspenseful" or "extremely suspenseful".
