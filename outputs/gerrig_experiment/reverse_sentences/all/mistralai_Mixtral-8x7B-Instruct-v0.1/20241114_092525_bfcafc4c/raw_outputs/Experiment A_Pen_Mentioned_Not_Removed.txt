 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not specified how likely it is that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. It would depend on the events that have not been included in the excerpt.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The excerpt describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Le Chiffre, and it implies that Le Chiffre may be planning to harm them. The use of descriptive language, such as "spidery, silent" to describe Le Chiffre and "lightning" to describe how Bond slams himself against the wall, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. However, without knowing the outcome of the situation, it is difficult to say for certain how suspenseful the passage is.
