 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the passage does not provide enough context or information about the events that follow. However, given that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, it can be inferred that the situation is not favorable for Bond's escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Not very likely" (1).

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it can be considered "Moderately suspenseful" (5). The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen, which creates a sense of uncertainty and anticipation for what will happen next. However, without more context or information about the events that follow, it is difficult to determine the full extent of the suspensefulness of the passage.
