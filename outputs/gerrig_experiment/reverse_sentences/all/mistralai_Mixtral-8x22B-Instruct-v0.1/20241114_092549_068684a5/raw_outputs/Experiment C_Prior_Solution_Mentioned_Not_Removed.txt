 Based on the provided passage, it's difficult to definitively determine how likely it is that Bond will escape from Blofeld, as the passage does not provide details on Bond's plan or resources for escape. However, given that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, it can be inferred that their situation is precarious and their escape may not be easy. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as "4. Neutral or Uncertain".

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it does create a sense of tension and uncertainty, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper in their captivity. The use of descriptive language, such as "ugly and large" to describe one of the men, and the mention of a gun being pointed at Bond, adds to the sense of danger and suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as "5. Moderately suspenseful".
