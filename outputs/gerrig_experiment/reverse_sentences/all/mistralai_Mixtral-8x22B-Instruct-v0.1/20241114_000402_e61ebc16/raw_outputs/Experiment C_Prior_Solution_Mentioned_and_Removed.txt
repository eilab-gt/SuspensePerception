 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the passage does not provide enough context or information about the events that follow. However, given that Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, it can be inferred that their situation is precarious and their chances of escape may not be very high. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "4. Neutral or Uncertain".

Regarding the suspensefulness of the passage, it can be considered "6. Very suspenseful" as it sets up a tense and dangerous situation for Bond and Vesper, with the threat of violence and danger looming over them. The passage also introduces the character of Blofeld, who is portrayed as a formidable and dangerous adversary for Bond. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen," and "Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen," adds to the sense of danger and suspense in the passage.
