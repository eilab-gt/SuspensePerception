 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld. However, given that Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, it can be inferred that their situation is precarious. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "4. Neutral or Uncertain".

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it is clear that the situation is tense and dangerous, with Bond and Vesper in the clutches of a criminal mastermind. The description of Bond being pinned to a chair with wire and experiencing pain adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as "6. Very suspenseful".
