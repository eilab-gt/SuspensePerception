Question 1: Based on the excerpt, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is difficult to determine with certainty due to the information provided. However, given Bond's history of resourcefulness and the fact that he has already taken some action to potentially free himself (e.g., the kick to the man's shins), it could be argued that his escape is moderately likely. So, I would choose option 5: Moderately likely.

Question 2: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes Bond's precarious situation and his attempt to fight back against his captors. The tension is heightened by the detail of Bond's actions and the uncertainty of the outcome. Therefore, I would rate the suspense as option 6: Very suspenseful.
