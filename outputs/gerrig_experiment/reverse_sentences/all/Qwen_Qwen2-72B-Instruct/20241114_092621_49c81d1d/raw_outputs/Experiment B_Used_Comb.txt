Question 1: Given the excerpt, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is uncertain. Bond has been captured and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's history of escaping perilous situations, the answer would be "Moderately likely" (5), as he has the skills and resourcefulness to potentially find a way out.

Question 2: The passage is very suspenseful (6). It describes Bond's capture and the immediate threat he faces from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, creating a tense and uncertain situation for the protagonist. The fact that Bond is disarmed and at the mercy of his enemies increases the suspense as the reader wonders how he will escape or if he will escape at all.
