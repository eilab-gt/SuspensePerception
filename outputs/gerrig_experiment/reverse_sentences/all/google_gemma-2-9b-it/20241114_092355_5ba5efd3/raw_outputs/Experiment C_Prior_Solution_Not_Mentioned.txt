Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men,  Fleming's writing often emphasizes Bond's resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet. The excerpt hints at Bond's attempt to use distraction and create an opportunity, suggesting he won't go down without a fight.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond captured and restrained, Blofeld's menacing demeanor is described, and there's a sense of impending danger. However, it lacks the heart-pounding action or cliffhanger that would push it into "very" or "extremely" suspenseful territory.
