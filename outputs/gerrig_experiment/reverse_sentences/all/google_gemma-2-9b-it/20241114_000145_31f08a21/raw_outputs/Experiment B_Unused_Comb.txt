Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and agile. He managed to evade the initial attack and avoid serious injury.  However, he's disarmed and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and disarmed.  The description of the gunmen and Le Chiffre's actions adds to the feeling of danger.  We know Bond is capable, but the situation is precarious, leaving the reader wondering how he will escape.
