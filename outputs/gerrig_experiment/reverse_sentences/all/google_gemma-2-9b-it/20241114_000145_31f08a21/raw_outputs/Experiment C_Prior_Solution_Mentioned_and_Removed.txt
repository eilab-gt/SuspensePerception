Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is in a precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The excerpt hints at his quick thinking in disarming Blofeld momentarily.  However, he's now bound and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and clearly in danger. Blofeld's menacing tone and the description of Bond's restraints add to the suspense.  We don't know what Blofeld's plans are, which keeps us on edge.
