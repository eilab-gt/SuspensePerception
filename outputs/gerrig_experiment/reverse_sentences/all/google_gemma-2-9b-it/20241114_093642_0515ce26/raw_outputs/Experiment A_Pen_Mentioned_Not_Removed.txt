Here are my answers based on the provided text:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is known for his resourcefulness and fighting skills, he is currently outnumbered and disarmed.  The situation seems precarious.  We don't have enough information to definitively say whether he will escape or not.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outmatched, and facing immediate danger.  The quick, sharp descriptions of the action ("lightning like", "crashing to the ground")  and the ominous tone ("spidery, silent summons", "gun trained", "Let's not waste time")  create a sense of urgency and anticipation.  We are left wondering what Bond will do next and whether he can overcome this challenge.
