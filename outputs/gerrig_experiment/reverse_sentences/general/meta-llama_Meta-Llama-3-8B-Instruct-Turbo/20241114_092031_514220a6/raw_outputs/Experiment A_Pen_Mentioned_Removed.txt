Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Bond is being dragged away. The situation seems quite dire for Bond, making it unlikely that he will escape easily.

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is filled with intense action, quick movements, and a sense of danger. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "Corsican the lightning Like", creates a sense of urgency and tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, making it a very suspenseful passage.
