Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are pinned down by wire and held at gunpoint. The situation seems quite dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or intervention.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and ominous descriptions, such as the crashing of the bird, the gunshots, and the physical discomfort of Bond being pinned down by wire. The dialogue is also quite menacing, with Blofeld's cold and calculating tone adding to the sense of unease. Overall, the passage creates a sense of high stakes and danger, making it extremely suspenseful.
