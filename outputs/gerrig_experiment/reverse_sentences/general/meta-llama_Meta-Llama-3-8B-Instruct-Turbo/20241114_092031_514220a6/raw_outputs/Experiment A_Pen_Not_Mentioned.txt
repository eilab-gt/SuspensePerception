Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they seem to be in a vulnerable position. The fact that Bond is being dragged by the gunmen and Le Chiffre is giving orders suggests that they are not in a position to escape easily.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is full of tension and suspense, with Bond and Vesper trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery", "silent", and "Corsican lightning", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, and the suspense is palpable.
