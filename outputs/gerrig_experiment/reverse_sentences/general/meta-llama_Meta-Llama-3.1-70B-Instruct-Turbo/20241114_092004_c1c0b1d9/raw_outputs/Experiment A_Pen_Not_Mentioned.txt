***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the situation, I would rate it as 6. Very likely. James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and despite being in a difficult situation, it's likely that he will find a way to escape or turn the tables on Le Chiffre.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate it as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of action, tension, and suspense, with Bond being caught, beaten, and disarmed. The situation is dire, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen next. The use of vivid language and descriptive phrases, such as "Corsican the lightning Like" and "shoe Bond's caught", adds to the sense of urgency and suspense.
