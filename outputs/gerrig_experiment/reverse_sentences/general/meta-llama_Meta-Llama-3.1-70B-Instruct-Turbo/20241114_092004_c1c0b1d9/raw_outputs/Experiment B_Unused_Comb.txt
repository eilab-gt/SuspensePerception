***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and it's unlikely that the author would let him be defeated so easily. Although the passage describes Bond being trapped and disarmed, it also highlights his agility and ability to minimize damage, suggesting that he may still have a chance to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and dramatic atmosphere, with Bond being ambushed by Le Chiffre's gunmen and disarmed. The use of action verbs like "leapt", "burst", and "twisted" creates a sense of urgency and chaos, and the fact that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies raises the stakes and creates suspense. The passage also ends with a cliffhanger, as Bond is left feeling "impotent and puny", leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
