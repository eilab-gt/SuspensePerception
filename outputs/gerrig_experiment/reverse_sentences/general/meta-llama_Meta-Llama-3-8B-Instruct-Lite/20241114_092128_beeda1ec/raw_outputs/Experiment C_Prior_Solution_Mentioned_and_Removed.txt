Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that Bond's chances of escape are low. He is physically restrained and unable to move freely, making it difficult for him to escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Blofeld is in a position of power. The use of descriptive language, such as "gunpoint", "dark", and "painfully more bit wire the of twist" creates a sense of foreboding and unease. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape or not.
