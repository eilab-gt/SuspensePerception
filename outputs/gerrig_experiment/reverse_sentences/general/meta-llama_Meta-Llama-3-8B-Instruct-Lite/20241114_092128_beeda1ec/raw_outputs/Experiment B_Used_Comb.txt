Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is trapped by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that he will escape on his own. He is described as being "trapped" and "unharmed" but unable to leave the room.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, James Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped by his enemies, and is left wondering how he will escape. The use of action-packed language, such as "burst door", "leapt men", "whirled suddenly", and "crashed he" adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The fact that Bond is being searched and disarmed by his captors also creates a sense of unease and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
