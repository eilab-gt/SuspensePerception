 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the passage does not contain any information about Bond's plans or abilities to escape. However, considering Bond's history in the series, it is reasonable to assume that he is a capable and resourceful character, so one might rank it as moderately likely (5) or somewhat likely (2) that he will find a way to escape.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. The description of the scene and the dialogue between Blofeld and Bond add to the tension, as the reader is unsure of what will happen next. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as moderately suspenseful (5).
