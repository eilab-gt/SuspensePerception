 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not contain any information about the outcome of their encounter.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The excerpt describes the physical struggle between Bond and the gunmen, adding to the suspense. Overall, I would rate the suspense level as 6, "Very Suspenseful".
