 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld, as the outcome of their encounter is not revealed. However, considering Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, there is a possibility that he might find a way to escape. Therefore, a neutral response, option 4 (Neutral or Uncertain), would be the most appropriate answer.

Answer Question 2: The suspense level in a passage depends on the reader's engagement and anticipation of the events. In this excerpt, there is tension built around Bond's and Vesper's predicament as prisoners of Blofeld. The description of Bond being captured, along with the introduction of new characters like Crushak, adds to the intrigue. However, without knowing the immediate outcome, the suspense level might vary between readers. Considering the elements of uncertainty and the presence of conflict, a moderate suspense level can be assumed. Therefore, option 5 (Moderately suspenseful) would be the most appropriate answer.
