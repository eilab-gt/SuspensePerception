Question 1: Given the excerpt, it's difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond's escape, but considering his resourcefulness and the fact that he is a main character in a series, one might lean towards 5. Moderately likely, or even 6. Very likely, as he has a history of escaping from dangerous situations.

Question 2: The passage is quite suspenseful, as it involves a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being held captive, and Bond attempting to escape. The actions described and the uncertainty of the outcome contribute to a high level of suspense. Therefore, the answer would be 7. Extremely suspenseful.
