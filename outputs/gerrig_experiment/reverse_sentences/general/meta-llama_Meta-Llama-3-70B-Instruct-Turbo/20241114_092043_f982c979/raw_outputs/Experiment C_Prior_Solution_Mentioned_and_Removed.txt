***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of vivid language, such as "wire piano of piece a wrapping by place in Bond pinned carefully and chair arm wooden a into Bond forced", creates a sense of tension and danger.
