Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages to briefly overpower Blofeld and get a gun, he is quickly subdued by Crushak.  He's now tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. This suggests escape will be difficult, but Bond is resourceful and has a history of defying the odds.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The excerpt is filled with tension. Bond's initial success is short-lived, and the description of him being overpowered and tied up creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. Blofeld's calm demeanor and threats add to the suspense.
