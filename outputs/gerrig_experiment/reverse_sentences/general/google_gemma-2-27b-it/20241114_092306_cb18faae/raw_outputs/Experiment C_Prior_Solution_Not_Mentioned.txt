Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

While Bond manages to briefly overpower Blofeld and get a shot off, he is quickly subdued and restrained.  Blofeld seems to be in control and has backup (Crushak). However, Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping tight spots suggest he might still find a way out.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the sudden shift in power dynamics. Bond initially gains the upper hand but is quickly overpowered. The description of Bond being tied up and Blofeld's menacing demeanor add to the tension. The ending leaves the reader wondering what Blofeld will do next, heightening the suspense.
