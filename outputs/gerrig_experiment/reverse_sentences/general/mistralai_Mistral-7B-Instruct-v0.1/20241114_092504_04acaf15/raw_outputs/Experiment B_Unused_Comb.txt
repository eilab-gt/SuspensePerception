 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. The passage describes Bond being captured and imprisoned by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. While Bond manages to defeat Le Chiffre in a fight, he is ultimately captured and taken to a hotel room. The passage does not provide any indication of Bond's plans or abilities to escape. Therefore, it is unclear whether Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. The description of Bond being captured and imprisoned by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned also adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not provide any significant twists or turns that would increase the suspense level. Overall, the passage is moderately suspenseful.
