 Question 1: Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are currently the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and it is unclear how they will be able to escape.

Question 2: Somewhat suspenseful. While the passage does not explicitly state that the situation is suspenseful, the fact that Bond and Vesper are prisoners and that Blofeld is a dangerous criminal figure adds an element of tension to the scene.
