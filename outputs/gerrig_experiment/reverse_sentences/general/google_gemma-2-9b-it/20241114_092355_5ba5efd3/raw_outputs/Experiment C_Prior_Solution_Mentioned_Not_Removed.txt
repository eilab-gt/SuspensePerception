Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently at a significant disadvantage. He's outnumbered, tied up, and Blofeld seems to have anticipated his every move. However, Bond has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations, so there's a small chance he might find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped, Blofeld is menacing, and the situation seems dire. We know Bond is capable of overcoming obstacles, but the immediate danger and Blofeld's calm demeanor raise the stakes and keep us engaged.
