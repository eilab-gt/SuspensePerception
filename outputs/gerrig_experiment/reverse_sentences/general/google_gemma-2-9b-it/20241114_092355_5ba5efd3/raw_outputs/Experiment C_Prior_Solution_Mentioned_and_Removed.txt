Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and restrained. Blofeld seems to have anticipated Bond's actions and set a trap.  However, Bond's history suggests he's capable of surprising escapes, even in seemingly hopeless situations.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of danger and tension. Bond is captured, restrained, and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. The description of Blofeld's menacing demeanor and the physical threat of the guns adds to the suspense.
