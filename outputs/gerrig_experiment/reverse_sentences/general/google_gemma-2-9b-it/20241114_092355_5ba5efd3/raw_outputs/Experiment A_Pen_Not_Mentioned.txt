Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, the excerpt highlights his quick thinking and agility. He manages to evade the Corsican's attack and even lands a blow. This suggests he's not going down without a fight and has the potential to outsmart his captors.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of a dangerous adversary. The short, clipped sentences and descriptions of quick movements create a sense of urgency and danger.  We don't know what Le Chiffre's plans are, and Bond's fate hangs in the balance.
