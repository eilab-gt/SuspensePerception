Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is known for his resourcefulness and skill, he is currently outnumbered and disarmed. Le Chiffre has clearly set a trap and seems to have the upper hand.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of danger and tension. Bond is captured, disarmed, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The description of the gunmen and Le Chiffre's actions heightens the feeling that Bond is in a precarious situation.
