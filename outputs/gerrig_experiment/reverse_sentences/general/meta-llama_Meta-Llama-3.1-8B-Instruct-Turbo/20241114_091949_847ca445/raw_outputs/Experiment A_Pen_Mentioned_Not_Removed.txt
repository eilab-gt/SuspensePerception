Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been subjected to physical harm (e.g., kicked in the shins, dragged by his feet). This indicates that Bond is in a vulnerable position, making it unlikely that he will escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is in grave danger. The use of vivid and intense language (e.g., "spidery, silent finger", "pain of whistle", "Corsican the lightning") creates a sense of tension and urgency, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The fact that Bond is being physically harmed and is at the mercy of his captors adds to the suspense.
