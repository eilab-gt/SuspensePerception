***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult situation. He and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak. Blofeld has the upper hand, having successfully trapped Bond. Additionally, Bond is being restrained and subjected to physical torture, which suggests that his chances of escape are low. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

This passage is highly suspenseful. The situation is intense, with Bond being held captive and subjected to physical torture. The use of action and dialogue creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making it difficult to predict what will happen next. The description of the setting and the characters' actions also adds to the suspense. Blofeld's sadistic personality and the fact that Bond is at his mercy create a sense of fear and unease. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
