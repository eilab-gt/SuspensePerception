***Answer to Question 1:*** 
Given the situation where Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and considering the fact that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond, it is likely that Bond will face a difficult time escaping. However, considering Bond's skills as a spy and his experience in escaping from similar situations, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld is "Moderately likely" (option 5).

***Answer to Question 2:*** 
This passage is very suspenseful (option 6). The use of descriptive language, the vivid imagery, and the tense situation where Bond is being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen create a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader feel on edge and curious about what will happen next. The dialogue between Bond and Blofeld also adds to the suspense, as it reveals the cunning and sadistic nature of Blofeld, making the reader wonder what kind of treatment Bond will face at his hands.
