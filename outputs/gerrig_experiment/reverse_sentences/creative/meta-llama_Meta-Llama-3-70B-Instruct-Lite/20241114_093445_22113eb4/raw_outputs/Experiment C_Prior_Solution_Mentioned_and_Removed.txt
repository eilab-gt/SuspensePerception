I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional text that was provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a perilous situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his escapades and ability to get out of tight spots. However, there's no indication in this passage about how Bond will escape or what resources he might have available to him.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage effectively conveys that Bond is in a dangerous situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. This creates tension and suspense, but it's a relatively brief passage that doesn't have a lot of build-up or intense action, which is why I wouldn't rate it as extremely suspenseful.
