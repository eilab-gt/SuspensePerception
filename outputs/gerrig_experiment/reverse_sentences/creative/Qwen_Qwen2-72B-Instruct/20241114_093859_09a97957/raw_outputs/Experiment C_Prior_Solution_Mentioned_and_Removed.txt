Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?
Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his men. Bond's fate is uncertain, as he has been captured and is being restrained, which makes the outcome of his situation unpredictable. The suspense is heightened by the detail of Bond being tied up and the looming threat of violence from Blofeld and his associate, Crushak. The fact that Bond has managed to escape dangerous situations in the past does not guarantee that he will escape this one, which adds to the suspense.
