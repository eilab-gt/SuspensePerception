***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would rate it as 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond has been captured by Blofeld and his henchmen, Bond's resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet (as seen in the passage) make it likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would rate it as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Blofeld's henchmen holding Bond captive and inflicting physical pain on him. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape the situation, which adds to the suspense. Additionally, the passage includes moments of sudden action and violence (such as Bond trying to make a move on Blofeld and being thwarted by Crushak), which contribute to the overall sense of suspense.
