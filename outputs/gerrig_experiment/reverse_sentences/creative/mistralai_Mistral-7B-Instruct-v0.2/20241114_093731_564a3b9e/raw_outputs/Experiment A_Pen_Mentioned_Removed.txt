 Based on the information given in the passage, it appears that Bond's situation is quite dire, and he and Vesper are currently prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Le Chiffre has already gained the upper hand, and Bond has been disarmed and is being searched. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily. I would answer Question 1 with option 1 (Not very likely).

Regarding Question 2, the passage is quite suspenseful due to the dangerous situation Bond finds himself in. The fact that he and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and that Bond has been disarmed and is being searched, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty about what will happen next. I would answer Question 2 with option 5 (Moderately suspenseful) or option 6 (Very suspenseful) depending on the reader's personal preference.
