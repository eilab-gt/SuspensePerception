 Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely
The passage describes Bond and Vesper being captured by Blofeld and his gunmen. There is no indication that Bond has an opportunity to escape at this moment, and in fact, he is being held against his will and is being injured with a wire.

Answer Question 2: 5. Moderately suspenseful
The passage is suspenseful because the reader knows that Bond has successfully carried out his mission to ruin Blofeld, but now he is in danger and his situation is uncertain. The tension builds as Blofeld speaks to Bond and Crushak, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. However, there is not enough information provided to determine the full extent of the danger Bond is in or what steps he might take to escape, so the suspense is not extremely high.
