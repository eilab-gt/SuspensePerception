 Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?" - 1 (Not very likely)

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?" - 6 (Very suspenseful)

The passage indicates that Bond and Vesper have been taken prisoner by Blofeld and his gunmen. Blofeld is taunting Bond, and it appears that Bond is at a disadvantage. The use of tense language and the fact that Bond is being physically restrained increases the suspense. However, the outcome is not known, making it an uncertain situation for Bond's escape. Therefore, the passage is very suspenseful, but the likelihood of Bond escaping is not very high based on the information given.
