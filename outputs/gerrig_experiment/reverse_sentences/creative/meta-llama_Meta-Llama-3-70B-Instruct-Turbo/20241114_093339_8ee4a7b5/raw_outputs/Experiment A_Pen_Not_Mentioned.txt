Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage describes Bond being trapped and searched by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, which suggests that Bond's situation is precarious. However, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and the passage does not explicitly state that escape is impossible. Therefore, it's difficult to predict the likelihood of Bond's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of words like "spidery", "silent", "whistle", "sharply", and "lightning" creates a vivid and intense atmosphere, and the description of Bond's struggles and attempts to resist his captors adds to the sense of suspense. Overall, the passage effectively builds tension and keeps the reader on edge, wondering what will happen to Bond next.
