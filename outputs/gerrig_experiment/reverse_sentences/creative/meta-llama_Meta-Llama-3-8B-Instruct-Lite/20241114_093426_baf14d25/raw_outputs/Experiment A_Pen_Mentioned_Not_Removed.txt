Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, having been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The text describes Bond being dragged away, and Chiffre ordering his search for Bond's weapons. This implies that Bond is unlikely to escape on his own, and may need to rely on outside help or creative thinking to break free.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dramatic situation, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The language used is vivid and evocative, creating a sense of urgency and danger. The use of words like "spidery", "silent", "sharply", and "brusquely" adds to the tension, and the descriptions of Bond's actions and reactions create a sense of fear and vulnerability. The overall atmosphere is one of high stakes and uncertainty, making it extremely suspenseful.
