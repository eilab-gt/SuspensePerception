Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and is being subjected to a search. This indicates that Bond is in a vulnerable position and has limited control over his situation, making it unlikely that he will escape easily.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger around Bond. The use of words like "prisoners", "gunmen", "search", and "strip" creates a sense of urgency and foreboding. The description of Bond's movements and actions, such as being dragged by the gunmen and being searched, also adds to the sense of unease and tension. The passage effectively builds a sense of anticipation and worry for the reader, making it very suspenseful.
