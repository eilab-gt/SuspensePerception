Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which implies that Bond is in a vulnerable and trapped situation. Additionally, the fact that Le Chiffre has already laid a successful trap for Bond suggests that he has a significant advantage over Bond. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"*** 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "spidery", "silent", "Corsican the lightning", and "unquiet" adds to the sense of tension and foreboding. The passage also creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind, such as "How will Bond escape?",
