1. Not very likely

Given that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are likely to be held captive in a controlled environment, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape easily. Blofeld has successfully laid a trap for Bond, and it's likely that Bond will face significant obstacles in trying to escape.
