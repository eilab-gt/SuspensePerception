Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that they are in a difficult and precarious situation. The fact that Bond is pinned down by wire and is being subjected to painful twisting by Crushak also implies that their chances of escape are slim.

Answer to Question 2:
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "large and ugly" to describe Blofeld's face, and "painfully more" to describe the wire twisting Bond's flesh, creates a sense of unease and fear. The passage also builds a sense of claustrophobia, with Bond and Vesper trapped and helpless against their captors. Overall, the passage is masterfully crafted to create a sense of suspense and tension, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.
