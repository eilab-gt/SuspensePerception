 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation and it is uncertain whether they will be able to escape. Therefore, I would rate their chances of escaping as 4. Neutral or Uncertain.

Question 2: The passage is quite suspenseful as Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. Blofeld's intentions are unknown, and his behavior is erratic. Therefore, I would rate the passage as 6. Very Suspenseful.
