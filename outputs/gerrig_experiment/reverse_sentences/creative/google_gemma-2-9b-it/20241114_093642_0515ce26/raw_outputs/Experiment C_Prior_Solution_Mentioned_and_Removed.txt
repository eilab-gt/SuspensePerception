Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:**  While Bond has a history of escaping dangerous situations,  he's currently outnumbered, tied up, and at the mercy of Blofeld's henchmen.  Blofeld seems to be enjoying the power dynamic and taunting Bond, suggesting he has a plan in place.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped and vulnerable, Blofeld is clearly enjoying his predicament, and there's a threat of violence hanging in the air. We don't know what Blofeld's ultimate plan is, which keeps the reader guessing.
