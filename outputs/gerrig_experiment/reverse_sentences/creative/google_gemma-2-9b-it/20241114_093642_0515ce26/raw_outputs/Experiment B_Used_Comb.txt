Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Explanation:** While Bond is captured and disarmed, he's shown to be resourceful and agile.  The passage highlights his ability to quickly assess situations and react effectively, even when caught off guard.  It's too early to say he's definitively trapped, and Bond's history suggests he'll likely find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Explanation:** The passage creates a sense of tension by revealing Bond's sudden capture. The quick shift from a confident Bond to a disarmed prisoner raises the stakes and leaves the reader wondering how he will escape. The descriptive language ("drawn guns", "caught him squarely", "trapped was he")  further heightens the feeling of suspense.
