Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently bound and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. Blofeld is clearly a cunning and dangerous adversary who has anticipated Bond's moves.  The passage highlights Bond's struggle and the immediate danger he's in.  It's too early to say he's in a hopeless situation, but escaping seems far from guaranteed.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension.  We see Bond trapped, outnumbered, and physically restrained. Blofeld's calm demeanor and menacing tone add to the suspense.  We don't know what Blofeld's plans are for Bond and Vesper, which leaves the reader on edge and wanting to know what happens next.
