 Based on the passage provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage ends with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. Since we don't have any information about Bond's plan to escape or any outside help that might be coming, it's difficult to determine the likelihood of Bond escaping.

Regarding the suspensefulness of the passage, I would rate it as:

6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes Bond being trapped and captured by Blofeld, who clearly has the upper hand. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, and whether Bond will be able to escape from this dangerous situation. The tension is further heightened by the fact that Blofeld has a reputation as a criminal figure, and by the mention of the two gunmen who are also present.
