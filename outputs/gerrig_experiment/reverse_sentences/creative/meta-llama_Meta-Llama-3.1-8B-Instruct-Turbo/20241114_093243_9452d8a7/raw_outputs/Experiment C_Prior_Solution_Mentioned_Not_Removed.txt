Given the passage you've provided, it appears to be a continuation of the story from the original passage about Bond and Vesper being captured by Blofeld. 

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Considering the circumstances in this passage, Bond is being held captive by Blofeld and two gunmen, and he's already been wounded in an attempt to escape. He's also being restrained and being held in a room by a person who seems to be taking pleasure in Bond's predicament. Given these circumstances, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage is quite graphic in its depiction of violence and suffering, and the tone seems to be more intense than suspenseful. However, the fact that Bond is trying to escape and is in a precarious situation suggests a level of tension and suspense. I would answer:

5. Moderately suspenseful
