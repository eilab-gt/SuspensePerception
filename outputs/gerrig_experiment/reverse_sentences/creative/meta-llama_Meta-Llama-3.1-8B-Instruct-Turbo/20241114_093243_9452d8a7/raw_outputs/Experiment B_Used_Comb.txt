***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 

Based on the passage, Bond and Vesper are already the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Bond tries to defend himself against the gunmen but seems to be overpowered, and his attempts to use his revolver are thwarted. He is also physically disarmed by Le Chiffre's men. Considering this, it's unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his men.
