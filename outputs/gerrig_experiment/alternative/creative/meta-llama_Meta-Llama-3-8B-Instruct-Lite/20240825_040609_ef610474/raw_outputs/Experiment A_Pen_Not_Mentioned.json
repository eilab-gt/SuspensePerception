"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has just been caught by Chifrex and his two gunmen, and Chifrex has taken away his revolver, so it seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape easily.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Mers trying to escape, Chifrex's quick and sneaky moves, and the physical confrontation between Mers and the Corsican. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Mers will be able to escape or not. The suspense is heightened by the fact that Mers is being overpowered by Chifrex and his men, which makes it seem unlikely that he will be able to turn the situation around."
