"To answer your questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose 1. Not very likely. Mers has been caught and disarmed, and he's being closely guarded by Chifrex and his gunmen. His attempts to fight back have been unsuccessful, and he's in a precarious situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Mers and Vesper in a precarious situation, and Chifrex's plans and motives not yet fully clear. The use of descriptive language, such as \"spidery\" and \"lightning-quick\", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The outcome is uncertain, keeping the reader on edge and wondering what will happen next."
