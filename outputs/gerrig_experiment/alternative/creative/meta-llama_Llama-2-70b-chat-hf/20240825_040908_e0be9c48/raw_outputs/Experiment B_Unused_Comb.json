"  Based on the passage, it is likely that Mers will escape from Chifrex, but not without difficulty. Mers has already demonstrated his resourcefulness and agility by shoving one of the gunmen and rolling to minimize the damage. He also seems to have a confident attitude, which could help him in his attempt to escape. However, Chifrex and his gunmen are a formidable opponent, and Mers is currently trapped and unarmed. Therefore, it is not extremely likely that Mers will escape without some kind of assistance or a twist in the plot.\n\nQuestion 1: 5. Moderately likely\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and uncertainty.

The use of descriptive language, such as \"the two gunmen carefully searched Mers,\" adds to the suspense and creates a sense of danger. However, the passage also provides some comic relief, such as when Mers uses his pocket comb as a weapon, which reduces the overall suspense.\n\nQuestion "
