"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would answer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers has been caught and disarmed, he seems to be thinking on his feet and has managed to subtly move his fountain pen (which might be a useful tool for escape?) deeper into his pocket. This suggests that Mers is resourceful and might find a way to escape, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of action and tension, with Mers trying to rescue Vesper and getting caught, then trying to think of a way to escape. The use of words like \"lightning\", \"whistle of pain\", and \"crashed to the ground\" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper, and how Mers will manage to get out of this predicament."
