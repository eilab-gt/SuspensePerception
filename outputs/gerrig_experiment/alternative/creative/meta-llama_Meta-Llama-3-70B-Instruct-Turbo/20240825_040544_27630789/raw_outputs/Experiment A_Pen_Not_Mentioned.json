"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has just been captured and disarmed, and Chifrex and his gunmen seem to have the upper hand.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted by Chifrex's henchmen. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"slammed\", \"whistled\", and \"crashed\" creates a sense of urgency and intensity, and the fact that Mers is at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of danger and uncertainty."
