"Based on this passage, here are my answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. The passage shows Mers being overpowered and trapped by Chifrex and his gunmen, with his revolver taken away and himself being searched and manhandled. This suggests that Mers is currently in a vulnerable position and escape seems unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of sudden and intense danger, with Mers being ambushed and overwhelmed by Chifrex and his gunmen. The use of words like \"burst\", \"leapt\", and \"barked\" creates a sense of urgency and violence, and the fact that Mers is trapped and disarmed adds to the tension. The reader is left wondering how Mers will get out of this situation, which creates suspense."
