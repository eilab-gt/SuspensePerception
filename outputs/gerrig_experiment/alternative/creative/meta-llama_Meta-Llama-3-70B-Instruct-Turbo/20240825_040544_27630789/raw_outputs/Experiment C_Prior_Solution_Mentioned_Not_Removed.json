Slightly likely\n\nMers has shown resourcefulness in the past, and he's already tried to take advantage of a distraction to escape. However, he's currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. While it's possible that Mers might find a way to escape, the odds seem to be against him at this point.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is quite suspenseful because Mers is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering if he'll be able to escape or if Kalweitz will succeed in eliminating him.
