"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has been caught and tied up by Kalweitz's henchman, Crushak, and it seems that Kalweitz has the upper hand.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates tension and suspense through the sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the window, Mers's attempt to escape, and his subsequent capture and binding by Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the contorted face of Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and danger. The situation is precarious for Mers, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next."
