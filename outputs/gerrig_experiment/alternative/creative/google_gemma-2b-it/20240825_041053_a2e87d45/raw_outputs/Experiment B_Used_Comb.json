"The passage is somewhat suspenseful. The assassination of Chifrex is a major event, and the passage makes the reader feel uneasy about Mers\u2019s safety. However, the passage is not particularly suspenseful. It is a straightforward story of an assassination, and the reader is not given much information about the characters or the circumstances of the case."
