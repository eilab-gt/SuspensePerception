" Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\" - 3. Slightly likely\n\nMers is a skilled and resourceful character, but he has been caught off guard and outmatched by Kalweitz's planning and violence. The fact that Mers has been pinned down and made immobile by Crushak's wire restraints makes it unlikely that he will be able to escape on his own.\n\nQuestion 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\" - 5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of danger and tension as Mers tries to escape and outsmart his captors. The distraction of the crashing bird and Mers's attempt to pull up the rug all serve to heighten the suspense and keep the reader on the edge of their seat. However, the violence and brutality of the situation also make it difficult to fully engage with the suspense."
