"  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:\n\nQuestion 1: Moderately likely. While Mers has managed to escape from Kalweitz once before, the passage suggests that Kalweitz has taken precautions to prevent another escape. The use of multiple gunmen and the careful binding of Mers in the chair suggests that Kalweitz is determined to keep Mers captive this time around.\n\nQuestion 2: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and uncertainty by hinting at the danger Mers is in and the unpredictability of Kalweitz's actions. The use of vivid imagery, such as the large bird crashing into the wall and the dark office, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere."
