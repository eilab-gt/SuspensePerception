"  Great! Here are my answers to your questions:\n\nQuestion 1: Somewhat likely\n\nBased on the passage, it seems that Mers has managed to outwit Kalweitz and his goons once again, and is now in a precarious position. While it's possible that Mers could escape, it's also possible that he could be caught off guard and caught in a bind. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Mers escaping as somewhat likely.\n\nQuestion 2: Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes Mers's attempts to escape from Kalweitz's clutches. The use of sensory details, such as the crashing bird and the dark office, adds to the tension and creates a sense of urgency. The description of Crushak as an \"ugly man\" and his grunt to indicate that he is done with Mers adds to the suspense. Overall, I would rate the passage as very suspenseful."
