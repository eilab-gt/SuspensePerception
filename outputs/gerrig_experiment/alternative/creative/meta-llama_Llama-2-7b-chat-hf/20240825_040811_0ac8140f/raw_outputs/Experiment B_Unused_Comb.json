Additionally, he has a revolver that he could potentially use to defend himself.\n\nQuestion 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\n\nAnswer: Very suspenseful. The passage builds tension from the moment Chifrex and his gunmen burst into the hotel room, and Mers's quick thinking and agility are not enough to escape their grasp.

The passage also leaves the reader wondering what Chifrex has planned for Mers, which adds to the overall suspense."
