"  Question 1: The likelihood of Mers escaping from Chifrex is moderately likely. Mers has shown resourcefulness and agility in avoiding Chifrex's trap, but Chifrex's superior numbers and firepower make it unlikely that Mers will be able to escape unscathed.\n\nQuestion 2: This passage is somewhat suspenseful. The use of quick, sharp movements and the threat of violence create a sense of tension and uncertainty, making it difficult to predict what will happen next. However, the passage also has a sense of inevitability, as Mers's attempts to evade Chifrex seem doomed from the start. Overall, the passage has a moderate level of suspense."
