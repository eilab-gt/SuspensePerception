"  Question 1: The answer is (3) Slightly likely. Mers has managed to escape from Kalweitz's grasp twice already in the novel, so there is a chance he could do so again. However, given the way the passage ends with Crushak pinning Mers in place, it seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape this time.\n\nQuestion 2: The answer is (6) Very suspenseful. The passage builds tension with each new development, starting with the bird crashing into the wall and ending with Crushak pinning Mers in place. The use of dark and the description of Crushak as \"ugly\" contribute to the sense of foreboding and danger, making the scene very suspenseful."
