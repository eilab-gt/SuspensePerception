"Based on the passage, here are my answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1. Not very likely. The passage suggests that Mers is securely tied up and under the watchful eye of Crushak, a large and intimidating man. While Mers has outwitted Kalweitz's guard in the past, it's unclear how he will manage to escape this time.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers trying to escape and Kalweitz and Crushak working to keep him captive. The sudden introduction of the bird crashing into the wall adds to the sense of surprise and unpredictability, making the passage very suspenseful."
