"Based on the passage, here are my answers to the questions:\n\n**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"**\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has been outsmarted by Kalweitz and is now tied up and at the mercy of Crushak, a formidable and menacing figure. The situation looks bleak for Mers.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Mers trying to escape and outwit Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. The sudden interruption by the bird, the brief struggle, and the subsequent capture and restraint of Mers all contribute to a sense of high suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape."
