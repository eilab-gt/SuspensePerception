"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would answer: 1. Not very likely. Mers is currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. He's already attempted to escape once and was foiled, so it seems like the situation is not in his favor.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the sudden bird crashing into the glass wall to Mers's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The descriptions of Crushak's menacing appearance and the painful wire restraints add to the sense of danger and tension, making the reader wonder what will happen to Mers next."
