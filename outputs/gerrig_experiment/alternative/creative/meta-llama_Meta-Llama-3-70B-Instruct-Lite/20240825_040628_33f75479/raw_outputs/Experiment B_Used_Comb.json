"Based on this passage, I'd answer the questions as follows:\n\n**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"**\nI would choose: 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage doesn't give much hope for Mers' escape, as he's been overpowered by Chifrex and his gunmen, disarmed, and trapped. Although Mers has shown some agility and quick thinking, he's currently at a disadvantage.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\nI would choose: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with a sudden and violent interruption of Mers' evening plans. The action is fast-paced, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next. The description of the scene, including the physical confrontation and the humiliation of Mers, adds to the suspense. The ending, with Mers feeling \"puny and impotent,\" leaves the reader with a sense of unease and concern for Mers' fate."
