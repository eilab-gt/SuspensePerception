"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose answer 3. Slightly likely. Mers has shown some resourcefulness and agility in trying to rescue Vesper and fight back against the gunmen, but he's currently at a disadvantage, having been disarmed and caught off guard. It's unclear what will happen next, but Mers' chances of escape seem slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers trying to rescue Vesper and getting caught by the gunmen. The description of the fight and the use of vivid language (\"like lightning\", \"whistle of pain\", \"crashed to the ground\") creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next to Mers and Vesper, which adds to the suspense."
