" ***Answer 1:*** 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is currently the prisoner of Kalweitz and his gunmen, with one of them, Mr. Crushak, specifically devoted to eliminating irritations from Kalweitz's life. Mers has already tried to escape once but was caught by Mr. Crushak. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Mers will easily escape from Kalweitz's custody.\n\n***Answer 2:*** 5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nWhile the passage contains some suspenseful elements, such as Mers's failed escape attempt and Kalweitz's threat to leave him with Mr. Crushak, the overall level of suspense is moderately high. This is because the outcome of Mers's situation is not yet revealed, and the reader is left wondering about what will happen to him next. However, there have been similar situations in the past where Mers has managed to escape, which might make the current situation less suspenseful for some readers."
