" ***Question 1:*** \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"\n\nAnswer: 3. Slightly likely\n\nJustification: Although Mers does put up a fight and manages to avoid injury, he is ultimately overpowered and captured by Chifrex and his men. However, Mers has already shown himself to be resourceful and cunning, so it's not impossible that he could find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2:*** \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"\n\nAnswer: 5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nJustification: While the passage does contain some tense moments, such as Mers' initial struggle against the gunmen, the overall outcome of the scene is not in doubt. We know that Mers is captured, so there's not a lot of suspense around the question of how the scene will end. However, there is still some tension around how Mers will be treated by Chifrex, and whether he will be able to escape or not."
