" Question 1: Based on the passage, I would choose option 1 - \"Not very likely\". The text suggests that Mers is currently in a challenging situation, being held prisoner by Chifrex and his gunmen, and his attempt to escape was unsuccessful. However, the likelihood of escape can change over the course of the novel, and this assessment is based only on this specific passage.\n\nQuestion 2: Based on the passage, I would choose option 5 - \"Moderately suspenseful\". The scene where Mers tries to escape and fails adds suspense to the narrative. However, since the outcome of this situation is not fully resolved within the passage, the suspense is limited to this specific part of the story."
