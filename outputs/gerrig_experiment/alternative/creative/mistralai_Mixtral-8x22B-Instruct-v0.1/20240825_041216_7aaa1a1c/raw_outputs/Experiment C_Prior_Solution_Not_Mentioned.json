" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nBased on the passage provided, it appears that Mers is currently restrained and under the watch of Kalweitz and his gunmen. Given this situation, it is unlikely that Mers will be able to escape without some form of intervention or assistance. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Mers escaping as 1. Not very likely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful. The use of dialogue and action creates tension and anticipation, as the reader is unsure of what will happen next. The presence of a gun and the threat of violence add to the suspense. However, the fact that Mers has been restrained and appears to be in a helpless situation lessens the suspense slightly. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as 5. Moderately suspenseful."
