" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n3. Slightly likely\n\nBased on the information provided, Mers has already demonstrated his ability to outwit his captors once before. However, he is now bound in a chair with piano wire, which suggests his movements are severely restricted. Additionally, he is being guarded by a man named Crushak, who appears to be more formidable than the previous guard. Therefore, while it is possible for Mers to escape, it seems slightly likely given his current circumstances.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with suspense, as Mers attempts to escape from Kalweitz and his gunmen. The sudden appearance of the large bird, Mers's attempt to trip Kalweitz, and his subsequent capture and binding all contribute to a sense of tension and uncertainty about what will happen next. The introduction of Crushak also adds to the suspense, as he is described as a very large and ugly man who is tasked with guarding Mers."
