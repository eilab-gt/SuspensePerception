"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"**\n1. Not very likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension as Mers, who had just defeated Chifrex, is caught off guard by the sudden entrance of armed men. The sequence of events, from Mers's attempt to defend himself to being trapped and searched, creates a sense of escalating danger and suspense. The fact that Mers feels puny and impotent indicates that the odds are not in his favor for escape at this point."
