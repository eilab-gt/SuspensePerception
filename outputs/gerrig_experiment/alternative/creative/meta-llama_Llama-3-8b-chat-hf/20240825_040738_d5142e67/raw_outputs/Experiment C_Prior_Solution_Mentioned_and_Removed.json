"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers is currently a prisoner of Kalweitz and Crushak, with no clear opportunity to escape or any visible means of doing so. He is also being threatened with being shot if he tries to speak to Crushak, which makes any potential escape attempt seem even more unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Mers being trapped and threatened by Kalweitz and Crushak. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkness, and the violent means by which Crushak restrains Mers all contribute to a sense of high stakes and uncertainty. The ominous tone and the dire threats made by Kalweitz also add to the suspense."
