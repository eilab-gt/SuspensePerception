"Based on the passage, I'll answer your questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has been caught and disarmed, and he is now being searched by Chifrex's gunmen. He is also being watched by Chifrex himself, who seems to be anticipating Mers's moves. The situation doesn't look very favorable for Mers's escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tense and action-packed moments, from Mers's sudden decision to take action to the quick and unexpected moves made by the Corsican and Mers himself. The reader is kept on edge as Mers tries to escape and exact revenge, and the presence of Chifrex and his gunmen adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty."
