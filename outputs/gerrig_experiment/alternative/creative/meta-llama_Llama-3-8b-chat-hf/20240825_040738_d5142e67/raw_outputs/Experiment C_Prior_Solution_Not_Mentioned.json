"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nAnswer: 1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Mers is currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman, Crushak. The passage describes the wire being wrapped around Mers's arms, which suggests that he is securely trapped. Additionally, Kalweitz has announced his intention to leave Mers with Crushak, implying that Mers is not going to be let go anytime soon.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and being subjected to physical harm (the wire wrapping around his arms), and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the ugly face of Crushak, and the menacing tone of Kalweitz, also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere."
