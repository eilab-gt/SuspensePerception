"Here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Mers is already captured and being held by Chifrex and his two gunmen, with Chifrex having taken away Mers's revolver and fountain pen. It's unlikely that Mers will be able to escape or turn the tables on his captors at this point.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is suspenseful because it sets up a high-stakes situation where Mers is trying to escape from Chifrex and his henchmen, and the outcome is uncertain. The quick and unexpected moves by the Corsican, the dramatic shift in power, and the fact that Mers is being disarmed and captured create a sense of tension and urgency, making the reader wonder what will happen next."
