"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: \"Not very likely\". Mers has been caught by Chifrex and his two gunmen, and it seems that he is now at their mercy. While Mers is agile and has managed to defend himself in the past, the situation seems dire and it's unclear what chances he has of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: \"Very suspenseful\". The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, from Mers's sudden decision to act to the swift and unexpected actions of the Corsican, who seems to be a formidable opponent. The outcome is uncertain, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next. The description of the scene is vivid and intense, adding to the suspenseful atmosphere."
