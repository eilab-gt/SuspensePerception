"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nExplanation: The passage provides no clear indication of Mers's chances of escaping. Mers has been caught by Chifrex and his men, and Chifrex seems to be quite aware of Mers's resourcefulness, as evidenced by his taking away Mers's fountain pen. Given this, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of Mers's escape without further information.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nExplanation: The passage is quite suspenseful as it depicts Mers's desperate attempt to reach Vesper and his subsequent capture by Chifrex and his men. The scene is full of tension, with Mers using his agility to try to gain an advantage, only to be thwarted by the Corsican's quick reflexes. The uncertainty of Mers's fate and the looming danger add to the suspense."
