"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1) \n\nMers' plan to escape after using a distraction and attempting to talk to Vesper involves a maneuver that almost goes awry when he is caught by Chifrex's swift and precise action. The description provided suggests that Chifrex is a skilled opponent, and it's not clear if Mers has a hidden weapon or an immediate escape route. Therefore, the likelihood of Mers escaping without being caught seems low.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Moderately suspenseful\" (5)\n\nThe passage has moments of action, as Mers makes a desperate attempt to follow Vesper and then is swiftly apprehended by Chifrex. The description of Chifrex's move to catch Mers' shoe and twist it is suspenseful, as it creates a close call for Mers. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Mers' plan and his chances of success adds to the suspense. Overall, the situation is tense but not extremely so."
