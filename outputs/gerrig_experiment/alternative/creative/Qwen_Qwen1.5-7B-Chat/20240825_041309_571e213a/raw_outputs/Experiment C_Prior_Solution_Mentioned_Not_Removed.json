"***Answer 1: Not very likely***\n\nBased on the passage, Mers has been caught off guard by the bird distraction and is now faced with two armed men, Crushak and Kalweitz. The situation does not seem to be in Mers's favor, as he is being tied up and warned about Crushak's vigilance. The mention of Crushak's involvement in a previous incident where Mers \"outwitted\" a guard and the guard's unfortunate demise suggests that Mers is not completely in control of the situation.\n\n***Answer 2: Moderately suspenseful***\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful because it introduces unexpected events like the bird crashing into the glass and the appearance of Crushak, both of which create a sense of danger and catch Mers off guard. The uncertainty of Mers's fate and the tension between him and Kalweitz heighten the suspense as the situation progresses. However, it's not extremely suspenseful, as the outcome is not completely unpredictable, and the development of Mers's character, Vesper, and their potential escape is not the main focus of this excerpt."
