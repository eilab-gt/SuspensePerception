"**Answer to Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"**\n\nI would rate this as a 5. Moderately likely. Although Mers is currently a prisoner and has just been disarmed, the passage suggests that he is a resourceful and agile individual who is capable of thinking on his feet. He has already attempted to escape and has managed to minimize the damage from the Corsican's attack. However, Chifrex and his men seem to be in control of the situation, and Mers's chances of escape are uncertain.\n\n**Answer to Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Mers attempting to escape and being thwarted by Chifrex's men. The use of action-packed language, such as \"hurling himself down the passage\" and \"crashed to the ground,\" adds to the sense of excitement and suspense. The fact that Mers is now a prisoner and is being searched and disarmed raises the stakes and creates uncertainty about his fate, which also contributes to the suspense."
