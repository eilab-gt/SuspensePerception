"Based on the provided passage, I'd answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage shows that Mers's initial attempt to escape was thwarted by Crushak, and he is now tied up with piano wire, which suggests that his chances of escape are slim. Additionally, Kalweitz has taken extra precautions by assigning Crushak to watch Mers and instructing him to shoot Mers if he tries to speak to him.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Mers's initial attempt to escape, the sudden interruption by the bird, and the subsequent confrontation with Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the image of Crushak's contorted face and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense. The fact that Kalweitz has taken extra precautions to prevent Mers's escape and has assigned a ruthless guard to watch him raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, making the passage very suspenseful."
