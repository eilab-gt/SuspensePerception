"Based on the passage provided, here are my answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: \"Not very likely\". Mers attempted to escape, but was quickly thwarted by Kalweitz's henchman, Crushak, and is now tied up with piano wire. The situation appears to be dire, and Mers's chances of escape seem slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: \"Very suspenseful\". The passage is full of tense moments, including the bird crashing into the glass, Mers's attempted escape, and the ominous and intimidating presence of Crushak. The use of phrases like \"Kalweitz smiled\" and \"I am not amused\" also adds to the sense of foreboding and menace, making the passage very suspenseful."
