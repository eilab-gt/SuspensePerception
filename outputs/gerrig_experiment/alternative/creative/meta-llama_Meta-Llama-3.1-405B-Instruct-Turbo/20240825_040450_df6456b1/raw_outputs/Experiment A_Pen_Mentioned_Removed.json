"**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"**\n\nI would rate this as a 2. Somewhat likely. Mers has already shown some resourcefulness and agility in his attempt to escape, and he seems to be thinking on his feet. However, he is currently outnumbered and outgunned, and Chifrex appears to be a cunning and ruthless adversary. While Mers may try to escape again, the odds are currently against him.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action, tension, and uncertainty. Mers's sudden decision to escape and his subsequent struggles with the gunmen create a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Chifrex seems to be one step ahead of Mers, anticipating his thoughts and actions, adds to the suspense. The passage ends with a sense of foreboding, as Chifrex's words \"Let's not waste time\" imply that something ominous is about to happen. Overall, the passage effectively creates a sense of tension and suspense, keeping the reader engaged and wondering what will happen next."
