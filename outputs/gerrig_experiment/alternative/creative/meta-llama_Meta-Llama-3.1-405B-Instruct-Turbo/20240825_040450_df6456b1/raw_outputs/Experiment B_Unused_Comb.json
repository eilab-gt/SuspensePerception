"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would rate this as 3. Slightly likely. Although Mers has shown some agility and quick thinking in his initial attempt to defend himself, he is now unarmed and outnumbered by three men, including the vengeful Chifrex. The odds seem to be against him, but Mers's resourcefulness and cunning might still allow him to find a way out.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as 6. Very suspenseful. The sudden and violent interruption of Mers's evening, the presence of guns, and the physical confrontation create a tense and thrilling atmosphere. The fact that Mers is now at the mercy of his adversary, Chifrex, and is feeling \"puny and impotent\" adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty, making the passage very suspenseful."
