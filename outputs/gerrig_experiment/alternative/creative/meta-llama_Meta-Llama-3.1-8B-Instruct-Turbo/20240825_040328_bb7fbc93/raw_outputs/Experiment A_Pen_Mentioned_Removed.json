"Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers is already a prisoner of Chifrex and his men, and they have him outnumbered and outgunned. His attempt to escape was quickly thwarted by Chifrex's quick thinking and agility. It's likely that Chifrex will maintain control and prevent Mers from escaping.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is highly suspenseful because Mers is trying to escape, but Chifrex and his men are hot on his heels. The use of quick and sudden action, such as Chifrex's lightning-fast movement to catch Mers's shoe, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering if Mers will be able to escape or if Chifrex will capture him, which makes for a very suspenseful passage."
