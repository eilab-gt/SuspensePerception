"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\n1. Not very likely (Mers has just been disarmed and captured, and the text doesn't suggest that he has a clear escape plan or opportunity.)\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful (The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers making a bold but risky move to escape, and Chifrex and his men quickly countering his attempt. The use of vivid language, such as \"Like lightning\", and the description of Mers's quick thinking and agile movements adds to the suspense.)"
