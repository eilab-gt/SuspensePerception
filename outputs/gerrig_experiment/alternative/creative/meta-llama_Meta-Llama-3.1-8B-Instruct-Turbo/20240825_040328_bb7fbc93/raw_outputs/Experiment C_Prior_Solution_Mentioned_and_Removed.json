"Here are the answers to the two questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\n1. Not very likely\n\nThis answer is based on the fact that Mers is now tied up and guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak who has orders to shoot him if he tries to escape or talk. This makes it clear that Mers is in a difficult situation and that escape is unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis answer is based on the fact that the passage creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is in a tight spot, with a gun pointed at his chest and Crushak threatening to shoot him if he tries to escape or talk. The use of dark language, the description of Crushak's ugly face, and the brutal way in which he binds Mers to the chair all contribute to a sense of suspense and foreboding."
