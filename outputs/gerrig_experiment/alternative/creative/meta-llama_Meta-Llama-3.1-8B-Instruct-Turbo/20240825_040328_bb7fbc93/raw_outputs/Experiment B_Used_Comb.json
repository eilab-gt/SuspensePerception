"Here are the answers to the two questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers has been outmaneuvered by Chifrex and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. He is physically trapped and helpless, which makes his escape seem unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a situation where the protagonist (Mers) is suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by three men, including a previously defeated opponent (Chifrex). The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next, and the use of phrases like \"As the three men approached him\" and \"Unfortunately\" creates a sense of tension and anticipation. The fact that Mers is able to defend himself in a creative way adds to the suspense, but the overall situation is still dire and leaves the reader on edge."
