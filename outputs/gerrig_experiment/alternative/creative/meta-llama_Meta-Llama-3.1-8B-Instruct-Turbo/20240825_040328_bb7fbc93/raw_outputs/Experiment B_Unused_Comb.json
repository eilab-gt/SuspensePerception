"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers has been outmaneuvered by Chifrex and is now trapped. The fact that Chifrex and his men were able to burst into Mers's hotel room and overpower him suggests that escape is unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it starts with a sense of normalcy (Mers getting ready to dine with Vesper) and then quickly escalates into chaos with the sudden appearance of Chifrex and his men. The rapid series of events, including the fight and the search, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The fact that Mers is trapped and seemingly out of options adds to the suspense."
