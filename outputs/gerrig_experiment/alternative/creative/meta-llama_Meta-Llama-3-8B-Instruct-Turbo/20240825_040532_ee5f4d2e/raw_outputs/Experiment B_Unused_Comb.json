"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage describes how Mers is trapped, and Chifrex and his gunmen have taken control of the situation. Mers is unable to use his revolver and his pocket comb is taken away, leaving him feeling impotent and helpless. This suggests that his chances of escape are low.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and surprise, as Mers is suddenly ambushed by Chifrex and his gunmen. The use of action-packed language, such as \"door burst in\", \"guns drawn\", \"well-placed shove\", and \"twisted it sharply\" creates a sense of urgency and drama. Additionally, Mers's feeling of impotence and helplessness adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering what will happen next."
