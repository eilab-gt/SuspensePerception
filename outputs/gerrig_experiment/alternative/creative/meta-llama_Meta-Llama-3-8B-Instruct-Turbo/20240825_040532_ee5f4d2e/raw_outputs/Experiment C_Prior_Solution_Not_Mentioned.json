"Based on the passage, I will answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nI would choose answer 1: \"Not very likely\". Mers is already a prisoner of Kalweitz and his gunman, Crushak, who has tied him up in a wooden armchair using piano wire. The situation seems dire, and it is unlikely that Mers will be able to escape on his own.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose answer 6: \"Very suspenseful\". The passage is full of tension and danger, with Mers being trapped and threatened by Kalweitz and Crushak. The unexpected distraction caused by the bird crashing into the window adds to the suspense, and the darkening of the room creates a sense of uncertainty. The use of vivid language, such as \"ugly\" and \"painfully\", also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere."
