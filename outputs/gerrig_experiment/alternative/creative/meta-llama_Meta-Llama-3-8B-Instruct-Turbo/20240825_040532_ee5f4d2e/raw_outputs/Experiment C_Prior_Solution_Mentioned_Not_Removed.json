Not very likely\n\nMers has been captured and tied up by Crushak, and Kalweitz has made it clear that he will be responsible for Mers' custody this time. Mers' previous escape was likely an exception, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to outwit Kalweitz and Crushak again.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and being held captive by Kalweitz and Crushak, who seem determined to eliminate him.
