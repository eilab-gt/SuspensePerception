"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose: 1. Not very likely\n\nMers is currently being held captive by Chifrex and his two gunmen, and Chifrex has taken away Mers's fountain pen, which could have been used as a potential weapon. Additionally, the gunmen have removed Mers's revolver and are keeping their guns trained on him. These factors suggest that Mers's chances of escaping are low.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose: 7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tense moments, such as Mers's attempt to escape, the sudden twist of Chifrex catching Mers's shoe, and the Corsican's quick and precise actions. The use of phrases like \"like lightning,\" \"very quickly,\" and \"agilely\" adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Mers. The fact that Mers is being held captive by a villainous character and has been disarmed adds to the sense of danger and suspense, making this passage extremely suspenseful"
