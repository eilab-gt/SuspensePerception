"Based on the passage, I would answer:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***:\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Mers is in a very difficult situation, trapped in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms, and being held by two ruthless individuals who are determined to keep him captive. Kalweitz has made it clear that Crushak has orders to shoot Mers if he tries to speak to him, making it highly unlikely that Mers will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***:\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful because it describes a tense and potentially deadly situation. Mers is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape or if he will even survive. The description of Crushak's appearance and the mention of the piano wire used to restrain Mers adds to the sense of foreboding and tension."
