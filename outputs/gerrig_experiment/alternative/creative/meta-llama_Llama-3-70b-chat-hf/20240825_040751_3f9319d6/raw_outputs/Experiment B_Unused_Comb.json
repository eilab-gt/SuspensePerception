"Here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has been caught off guard, disarmed, and trapped by Chifrex and his gunmen. He has been searched and seems to be at their mercy.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage starts with a sense of normalcy and confidence, but suddenly takes a dramatic turn with the burst of violence and Mers's capture. The tension builds as Mers is searched and disarmed, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The ending phrase \"Mers felt puny and impotent\" adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding."
