"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nMers has already shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the window to try to escape. However, he was ultimately caught by Kalweitz's henchman, Crushak. While Mers is currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and Crushak, it's possible that he may find another opportunity to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman, and the reader is left wondering if he will be able to escape or if he will be harmed. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"very large and very ugly man\" and the \"painfully\" twisted piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and suspense."
