"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would answer: 3. Slightly likely\n\nAlthough Mers is a skilled and resourceful character, the situation seems dire, with him being captured and disarmed by Chifrex and his gunmen. However, Mers's quick thinking and agility suggest that he may still have a chance to escape or outsmart his captors.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tense moments, from Mers's decision to act to his failed attempt to rescue Vesper, and then to his being caught and searched by Chifrex's gunmen. The rapid sequence of events, the use of action words like \"hurled\", \"slammed\", \"whistled\", and \"twisted\", and the sense of danger and uncertainty all contribute to a highly suspenseful atmosphere."
