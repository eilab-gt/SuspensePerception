"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Mers has shown some agility and quick thinking in his attempt to escape and do damage to the gunmen, but he has been caught and disarmed, and Chifrex seems to be one step ahead of him. While Mers may still have some tricks up his sleeve, his current situation looks precarious.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and action, as Mers tries to escape and is thwarted by the Corsican's quick reflexes. The scene is vividly described, with a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, and whether Mers will be able to outsmart Chifrex and his henchmen."
