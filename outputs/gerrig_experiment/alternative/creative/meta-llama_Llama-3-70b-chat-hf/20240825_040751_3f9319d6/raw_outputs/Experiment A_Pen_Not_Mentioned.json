"Based on the passage, I'd answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers is currently a prisoner and Chifrex seems to have the upper hand, Mers has shown resourcefulness and agility in his attempt to escape and defend himself. This suggests that he may still have a chance to escape, but it's not a sure thing.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of action and tension, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted by Chifrex's henchmen. The use of vivid language, such as \"like lightning\" and \"whistled past his hip\", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, making the passage very suspenseful."
