"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers is currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman, Crushak, Mers has already demonstrated his resourcefulness by attempting to escape once and causing a distraction. This suggests that Mers may still have a few tricks up his sleeve, and it's possible that he might find a way to escape again.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful because Mers is in a precarious situation, tied up and at the mercy of his enemies. The threat of violence is palpable, and the reader is left wondering if Mers will be able to escape or if he will be harmed or killed. The passage also creates a sense of tension and unease, particularly with the description of Crushak's ugly face and his orders to shoot Mers if he attempts to speak. Overall, the passage does a good job of building suspense and keeping the reader on edge."
