"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n2. Somewhat likely\n3. Slightly likely\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n5. Moderately likely\n6. Very likely\n7. Extremely likely\n\nGiven the current situation, it seems Mers has already attempted to escape and failed, being efficiently restrained by Crushak. The use of piano wire suggests a tight and painful captivity, which makes it seem unlikely that Mers will escape easily. However, since he managed to momentarily take Kalweitz by surprise, there might be a chance, albeit a small one, for a future escape attempt. So, the answer would be closer to 2 or 3 on this scale, leaning towards 'Somewhat likely' due to Mers's resourcefulness.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n1.

Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with action, tension, and the anticipation"
