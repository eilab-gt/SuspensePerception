"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nMers has shown initiative to fight back and attempt an escape, but he is quickly and effectively neutralized by Chifrex's Corsican associate. With his weapon taken and being outnumbered, the situation seems dire, but Mers's resourcefulness and prior success in his mission suggest he might have a plan or hidden resources (e.g., the fountain pen mentioned). Thus, without more information on his escape plan or abilities, it's uncertain how likely his escape is.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with action and tension. Mers's daring decision to act and the subsequent failure to escape, followed by the calm command from Chifrex, creates a sense of uncertainty and danger. The reader is left wondering about Mers's next move and the fate of Vesper. The scene is set for a potential turn of events, heightening the suspense."
