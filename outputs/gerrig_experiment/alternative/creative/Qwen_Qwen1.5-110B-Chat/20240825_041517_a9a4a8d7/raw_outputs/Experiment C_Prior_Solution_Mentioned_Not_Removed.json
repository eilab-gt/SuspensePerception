"***Question 1 Revisited: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n3. Slightly likely\nThe passage suggests that Mers is resourceful and attempts to use the momentary chaos to his advantage, but he is quickly overpowered and incapacitated. The use of the piano wire indicates a higher level of security and intention to prevent escape, making it seem less likely, but Mers has escaped before, adding a sliver of possibility.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n5. Moderately suspenseful\nThe scene is filled with tension as Mers tries to escape and Kalweitz's control is momentarily lost, only to be regained in a more ominous fashion. The description of the large bird crashing into the window, the darkening of the room, and the presence of the menacing Crushak all contribute to a moderate level of suspense, as the outcome is uncertain and the stakes are high for Mers."
