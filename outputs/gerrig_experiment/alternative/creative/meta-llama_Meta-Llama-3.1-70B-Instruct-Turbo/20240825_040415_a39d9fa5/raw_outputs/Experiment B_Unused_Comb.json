"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would rate this a 3: Slightly likely. Mers has shown agility and quick thinking in the past, but he is currently outnumbered, outgunned, and trapped. While it's possible he might come up with a clever escape plan, the odds seem to be against him at this point.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this a 6: Very suspenseful. The sudden and violent interruption of Mers's preparations for a romantic dinner sets a tense tone, and the subsequent search and humiliation of Mers by Chifrex's men ratchets up the tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, and the ominous tone suggests that it won't be good."
