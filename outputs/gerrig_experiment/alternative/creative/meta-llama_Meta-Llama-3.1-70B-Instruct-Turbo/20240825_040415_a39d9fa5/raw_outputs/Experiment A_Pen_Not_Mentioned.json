"Based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would answer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers is currently a prisoner and has just been disarmed, he has already demonstrated his agility and quick thinking in trying to follow Vesper and attempting to take down the gunmen. He may still have a chance to escape or turn the tables on his captors.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite tense and action-packed, with Mers making a desperate attempt to follow Vesper and getting caught by the Corsican. The use of verbs like \"hurled\", \"slammed\", \"shot\", and \"twisted\" creates a sense of urgency and violence. The fact that Mers is now disarmed and at the mercy of Chifrex and his men adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next."
