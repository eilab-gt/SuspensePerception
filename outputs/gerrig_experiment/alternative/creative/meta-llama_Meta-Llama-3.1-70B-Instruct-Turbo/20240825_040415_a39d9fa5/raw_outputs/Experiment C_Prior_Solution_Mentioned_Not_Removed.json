Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because Mers is in a dire situation, trapped and helpless, with Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak seeming to have the upper hand.

The use of vivid and ominous descriptions, such as Crushak's ugly face and the painful piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and suspense."
