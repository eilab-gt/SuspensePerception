"Based on the provided passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers is currently a prisoner and has just been disarmed, he has already shown resourcefulness and quick thinking by attempting to escape and hiding his fountain pen. This suggests that he might have a plan or a chance to escape in the future.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful, as Mers's attempt to escape is thwarted, and he is now at the mercy of Chifrex and his gunmen. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, and the situation feels precarious and tense. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"crashed to the ground\", and \"roughly stripped\" adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful."
