"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n3. Slightly likely\n\nMers demonstrates resourcefulness and quick thinking in attempting to pursue Vesper and in his attempt to protect his fountain pen. However, his escape attempt is swiftly thwarted by the Corsican, and Chifrex and his men seem to be in control of the situation. There is a hint of potential, but the odds are not in Mers's favor.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension, as Mers makes a daring move, only to be quickly incapacitated by the Corsican. The anticipation of what will happen next, the potential use of the fountain pen (which might be more than just a pen), and Chifrex's menacing presence all contribute to a sense of high suspense. The imminent danger to both Mers and Vesper also adds to the intrigue."
