"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n2. Somewhat likely\n\nMers's attempt to rush the gunmen shows some initiative and resourcefulness, but he is quickly subdued by Chifrex's skillful move. However, given that Mers has demonstrated agility and pride in his motion, it suggests he might have other plans or abilities that could contribute to his escape. The situation is uncertain, so it's not a guaranteed escape, but it's not completely hopeless either.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nThe passage presents a tense situation with Mers attempting a daring escape, Chifrex's swift counterattack, and the anticipation of what might happen next. The\u63cf\u5199 of the action and Chifrex's command add to the suspense, making it more than just a casual scene but not quite reaching extreme levels of tension."
