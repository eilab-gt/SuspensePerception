"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nGiven the situation described, it's not clear if Mers has a clear path to escape. While he was able to create a distraction, he is now effectively tied up, and Crushak seems to be a more competent and intimidating guard than Kalweitz's previous one. However, Mers has demonstrated resourcefulness before, so it's not impossible that he will find a way out.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe scene is filled with tension, as Mers is in immediate danger and has to contend with not only Kalweitz but also the imposing figure of Crushak. The use of a distraction, the darkened room, and the threat of violence heighten the suspense. Additionally, the mention of Kalweitz's previous guard's fate adds an extra layer of intrigue and danger."
