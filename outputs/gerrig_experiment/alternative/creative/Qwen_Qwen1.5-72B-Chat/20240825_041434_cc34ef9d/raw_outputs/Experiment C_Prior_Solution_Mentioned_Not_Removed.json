"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n5. Moderately likely\n\nGiven Mers's quick thinking and ability to create a distraction, he has shown resourcefulness in the past. However, the presence of Crushak, who appears both large and competent, as well as the fact that Mers is now physically restrained, makes the situation challenging but not entirely hopeless.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension and immediate danger, as Mers attempts to escape but is ultimately captured by Kalweitz's henchman. The description of the events, the use of a distraction, and the introduction of the menacing character Crushak contribute to a sense of heightened suspense and anticipation about Mers's fate."
