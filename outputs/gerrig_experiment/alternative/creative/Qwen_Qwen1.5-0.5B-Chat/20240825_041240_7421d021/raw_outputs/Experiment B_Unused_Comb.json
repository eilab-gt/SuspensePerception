"Based on the passage, it seems that Mers has caught Chifrex in a trap that he set up to shut him down. The three men, who are the gunsmen, are looking for other weapons and weapons-related information. They, however, seem to be quite impressed by Mers and treat him as if he is a helpful assistant, particularly because he accidentally smashes Chifrex's shoe with his heel. Mers feels somewhat helpless and ultimately thinks of escaping from Chifrex using a \"small toy,\" which he believed was his weapon. Overall, the passage seems to show that Mers has some level of control and intelligence, but he has not yet fully realized it."
