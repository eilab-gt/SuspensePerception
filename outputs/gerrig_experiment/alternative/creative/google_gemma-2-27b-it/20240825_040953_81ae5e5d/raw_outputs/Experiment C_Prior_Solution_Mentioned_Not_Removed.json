"Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\n**1. Not very likely** \n\nThe passage paints a grim picture. Mers is now tightly bound, and Kalweitz has made it clear he's taking extra precautions after Mers' previous escape. The presence of a hulking, dedicated enforcer like Crushak further decreases Mers' chances.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n**6. Very suspenseful**\n\nThe passage builds tension effectively:\n\n* **Unexpected Attack:** The bird crashing into the window is a jarring event that disrupts the tense standoff.\n* **Sudden Shift in Power:** Mers momentarily gains the upper hand, but it's quickly reversed by Crushak's appearance.\n* **Kalweitz's Threat:** His mention of the previous guard's death and his statement about Crushak's dedication creates a palpable sense of danger.\n* **Mers's Restraint:** The detailed description of Mers being bound adds to the feeling of helplessness and vulnerability.\n\nAll these elements contribute to a highly suspenseful reading"
