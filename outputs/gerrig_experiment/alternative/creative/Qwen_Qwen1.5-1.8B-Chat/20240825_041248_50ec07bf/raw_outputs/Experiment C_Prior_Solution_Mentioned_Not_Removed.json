"5. Moderately likely\n\n***Question 3: How does the sentence \"It made him look no less ugly\" contribute to the suspenseful nature of the passage?***\n1. Provides a visual cue: The sentence describes how Kalweitz's face contorts into a smile, which implies that he is not amused by Mers's antics and appears to be more ominous and menacing than before.\n2. Creates a sense of foreboding: The use of the word \"ugly\" sets a negative tone for Kalweitz, suggesting that he is not the kind of person one would want to meet. The sentence also implies that the large man who is now holding Mers is no less menacing, further heightening the suspenseful atmosphere.\n3. Highlighting the stakes: The sentence implies that Kalweitz's friend, Mr. Crushak, is determined to eliminate irritation from Mers' life and has employed the large man to accomplish this goal. The use of the word \"responsible\" suggests that there is a reason for the man's anger towards Mers, which raises the possibility that Kalweitz's actions may have unintended consequences or that there is some deeper reason behind his desire to \"ruin\" Mers.\n4"
