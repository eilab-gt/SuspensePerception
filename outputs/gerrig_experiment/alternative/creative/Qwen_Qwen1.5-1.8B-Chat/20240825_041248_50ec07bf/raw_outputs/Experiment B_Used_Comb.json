"3. Slightly likely\n\nThe passage describes Mers's victory against Chifrex, which leads him to extend an invitation to Vesper for a meal in a hotel restaurant. The fact that Mers has defeated Chifrex suggests that he is confident and able to face his opponent head-on, making him slightly likely to escape the trap laid by Chifrex and avoid capture. While Mers is not unharmed, his agility, quick thinking, and knack for delivering a well-placed shove make him a formidable foe, and the other two gunmen's attentiveness further reduces the likelihood of him successfully escaping. The situation is suspenseful as Mers tries to outsmart his opponents, but his failure is not completely guaranteed, making the answer slightly likely."
