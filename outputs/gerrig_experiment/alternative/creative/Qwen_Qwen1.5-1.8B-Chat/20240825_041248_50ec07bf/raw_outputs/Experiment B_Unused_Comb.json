"7. Extremely likely. Mers's confidence after defeating Chifrex and extending an invitation to Vesper to dine with him in the hotel restaurant only served to increase his prospects of escape. The three men approaching him with guns drawn and Chifrex demanding a search of Mers seem to indicate that Mers is in serious trouble. The two gunmen searching Mers and removing his revolver from its shoulder holster and twisting it into a sharp weapon against Mers further demonstrates that Mers is being held captive and is a significant target. The fact that Chifrex is assuring Mers that they will not waste time on a search and that he will not harm Mers further suggests that Mers has a chance of survival. The fact that Chifrex pulls out Mers's pocket comb and starts searching him again further implies that he has more plans and resources at his disposal, further increasing the likelihood of Mers's escape. Finally, the fact that Chifrex tells Mers that they will not waste time suggests that Mers is in a situation where his escape is imminent, further increasing his chances of survival."
