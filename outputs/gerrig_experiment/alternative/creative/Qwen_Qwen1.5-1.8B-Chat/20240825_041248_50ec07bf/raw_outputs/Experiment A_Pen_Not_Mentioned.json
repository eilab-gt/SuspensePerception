"4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage provided describes a suspenseful situation in which Charles Mers, a criminal figure, is tasked with breaking into a house and causing chaos, specifically by disabling two gunmen, Chifrex and his assistant, Vesper. Mers comes up with a plan to shoot Mers's shoe and twist it with great pride to cause damage to the shooters' clothing and hinder their movement. While the two gunmen are searching Mers, Mers manages to right himself with minimal damage and escape by striding out of the room and into a nearby passage. Chifrex observes his assistant's work carefully, then crosses the room and commands Mers to come with him.\n\nIn the midst of this event, Mers must balance his desire to escape with his ability to hinder the shooters' escape and to protect himself. The passage is filled with tension and anticipation, as the pursuit and rescue mission unfold. The writer does not explicitly state the probability of Mers escaping, but it is clear that Mers's quick thinking, agility, and the use of a weapon he holds dear (the revolver) are key factors in the suspenseful nature of the passage. Therefore, the answer is 4. Neutral or Uncertain."
