"3. Slightly likely\nMers' plan to hurt the two gunmen and communicate with Vesper was well thought out and executed in a carefully planned sequence. He successfully targeted the two gunmen and shot them with his left hand, catching their shoe at the top of its arc. After causing pain to the thin man, he twisted the seized shoe sharply and threw it against the wall. Mers rolled agilely to avoid detection and then moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, revealing the gun he had taken from the guard's holster. With the two gunmen still in pursuit, Chifrex strategically took away Mers' fountain pen, indicating that he had a plan to retrieve the gun and eliminate Mers. While the plan may not have been perfect and the two gunmen were able to escape, Mers' expertise in quick thinking and agility allowed him to execute his plan and survive the situation with minor damage. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Mers' chances of escaping from Chifrex are slightly likely."
