" Based on the information provided in the passage, here are my answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage describes how Mers was caught by Kalweitz and his men, and he is now a prisoner in their hands. The passage also indicates that there have been previous attempts by Mers to escape from Kalweitz, and that those attempts have resulted in the deaths of Kalweitz's guards. These facts suggest that Mers is in a precarious situation, and it is unlikely that he will be able to escape easily. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot Mers if he tries to speak also increases the tension and suspense of the situation."
