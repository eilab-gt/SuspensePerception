"3. Slightly likely\n\nThe passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene where Charles Mers, the protagonist, is being held captive by Kalweitz and his two gunmen. The scene starts with Kalweitz pointing a gun at Mers, who is trying to escape. As Mers is pulled up one corner of the rug on which Kalweitz stands, a large bird crashes into the wall of glass, causing Mers to lose sight of the door. The scene then shifts to Kalweitz's large office, where he is confronted by a large and ugly man who is holding Mers captive. The man, Crushak, forces Mers into a wooden armchair and pins him in place by wrapping a piece of piano wire around each of the chair's corners. The subsequent twists of the wire cause more pain to Mers's flesh, and Kalweitz taunts Mers, saying that he came as a guest and now Mers is going through his personal belongings. Kalweitz concludes by saying that Mers has behaved poorly and will be left with Crushak to contemplate his rude behavior. The scene is filled with tension and suspense as Mers tries to escape and the two men struggle to control the situation."
