"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBased on the passage, Mers has already tried to take advantage of a distraction to escape but was met with an obstacle (the large bird and the presence of Crushak with a gun). Kalweitz also mentions that Mers outwitted his guard in a previous encounter, but the guard died, suggesting that Kalweitz is aware of Mers's abilities and is not taking any chances. Therefore, it is not very likely that Mers will be able to escape easily.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense situation where Mers is trying to escape from Kalweitz's office but is repeatedly foiled. The gunshots, the unexpected interruption from the bird, and the appearance of Crushak with a second gun all create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Mers being tied up and the mention of Crushak's loyalty to eliminating irritations adds to the tension and raises the stakes for Mers's survival."
