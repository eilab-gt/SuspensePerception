"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1)***\n\nMers' attempt to escape from Chifrex is not very likely because he is quickly caught by the Corsican, who skillfully twists Mers's shoe and disarms him. Mers's plan to cause damage to the gunmen and have a brief conversation with Vesper is interrupted, and Chifrex's attention is on him, making it seem unlikely that Mers will be able to slip away unscathed.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Very suspenseful\" (7)**\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful as it describes a tense and rapid sequence of events. Mers's sudden action, the Corsican's quick reflexes, and Chifrex's seemingly telepathic awareness create a sense of danger and urgency. The characters' movements and the possibility of a successful escape or a trap waiting for Mers keep the reader engaged and on edge."
