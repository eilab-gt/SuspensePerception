"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1)***\n\nMers's escape from Chifrex seems unlikely at this point. He is already on the ground after being outmaneuvered by Chifrex, and Chifrex is actively searching him for additional weapons. Additionally, Chifrex's attention is on Mers, which gives him a moment to observe the situation but does not necessarily indicate an easy escape.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Moderately suspenseful\" (5)**\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful because it describes a tense and action-packed scene with unexpected twists and turns. Mers's quick thinking and attempted escape create a sense of urgency, but his plan is foiled by Chifrex's skill. The uncertainty of Mers's fate and the possibility of a confrontation with Chifrex adds to the suspense."
