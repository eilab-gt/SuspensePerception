"***Answer 1: Not very likely***\nBased on the description provided, Mers's attempt to escape by kicking the thin man and chasing after Vesper is interrupted when Chifrex quickly and skillfully captures him. Chifrex's ability to shoot out his hand and twist Mers's shoe to bring him down, as well as the fact that he is searching for other weapons, suggests that Mers is not in a position to easily escape. Therefore, it is not very likely that Mers will escape from Chifrex.\n\n***Answer 2: Moderately suspenseful***\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful because it sets up a tense situation where Mers, trying to help Vesper, is caught off guard by Chifrex's skills and the imminent threat of being searched. The description of Mers's actions and the quick turn of events keeps the reader engaged, wondering if he will be able to evade capture or if he has a chance to communicate with Vesper. The suspense is not extremely high because the outcome seems predetermined by Chifrex's abilities, but it is enough to create tension in the narrative."
