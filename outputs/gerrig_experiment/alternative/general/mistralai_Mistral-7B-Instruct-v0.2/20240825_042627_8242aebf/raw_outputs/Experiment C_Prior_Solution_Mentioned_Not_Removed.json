" Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems unlikely that Mers will escape from Kalweitz (Option 1). The criminal figure has two gunmen with him and has successfully captured Mers. The scene describes Mers being tied up with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to move.\n\nAs for the suspensefulness of the passage, it is moderately suspenseful (Option 5). The scene sets up a clear conflict between Mers and Kalweitz, and the use of gunmen and the mention of past encounters adds tension to the situation. However, the passage does not provide any new or unexpected twists, so the suspense is not extremely high."
