"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"**\n1. Not very likely\n2. Somewhat likely\n3. Slightly likely\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n5. Moderately likely\n6. Very likely\n7. Extremely likely\n\nBased on the passage, Mers has been caught off guard and is now restrained by Crushak, who appears to be a strong and dedicated enforcer for Kalweitz. The situation does not suggest a clear opportunity for escape, given the presence of the large, intimidating man and the elaborate method used to tie Mers up. Therefore, the answer is likely \"Not very likely.\"\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n5. Moderately suspenseful\n6. Very suspenseful\n7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and suspense, particularly with the unexpected bird distraction, Mers's attempt to take advantage, and the introduction of Crushak, who adds a new layer of danger. The uncertainty of Mers's fate and the looming presence of Kalweitz's threat make it moderately to very suspenseful."
