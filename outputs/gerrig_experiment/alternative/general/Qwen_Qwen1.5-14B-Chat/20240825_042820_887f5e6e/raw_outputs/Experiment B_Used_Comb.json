Very suspenseful\n7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because Mers, who had just appeared to gain an advantage by taking down one of the gunmen, is suddenly caught off guard and overpowered.

The uncertainty of what will happen next keeps the reader engaged in the suspense."
