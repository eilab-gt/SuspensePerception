"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. While Mers has shown agility and quick thinking in his attempt to escape, he is currently outnumbered and outgunned. Chifrex and his men seem to be in control, and Mers's initial attempt at escape was thwarted.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action, tension, and uncertainty. Mers's sudden decision to escape, the swift and violent response from the Corsican, and the ominous presence of Chifrex all contribute to a sense of high stakes and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Mers will be able to escape or come up with a new plan."
