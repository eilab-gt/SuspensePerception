"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would rate this as 2. Somewhat likely. While Mers has shown resourcefulness in trying to escape, he is currently tied up with piano wire and being guarded by a large and ugly man with a gun. However, Mers has a history of outwitting his captors, as mentioned by Kalweitz, so it's possible he may find a way to escape again.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being held captive and subjected to physical pain. The introduction of the large and ugly Mr. Crushak adds to the sense of menace, and Kalweitz's calm and collected demeanor makes him a formidable villain. The fact that Mers has a history of escaping from captivity raises the stakes and creates uncertainty about what will happen next."
