"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. While Mers has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past (e.g., using the bird's distraction to try and escape), he is currently tied up with piano wire and being guarded by a large and ugly man with a gun. The situation seems dire, and escape appears unlikely, but Mers's past successes suggest that he may still have a slim chance of finding a way out.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Mers facing a life-threatening situation and Kalweitz's sinister intentions clear. The use of vivid descriptions (e.g., the \"very large and very ugly man\", the \"painfully\" biting piano wire) adds to the sense of tension and foreboding, making the passage very suspenseful."
