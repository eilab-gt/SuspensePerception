"**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"**\n\nI would rate this as: 3. Slightly likely\n\nAlthough Mers was able to create a temporary distraction and make a brief attempt to escape, he was quickly thwarted by Crushak and is now securely tied up with piano wire. Kalweitz's operation seems well-staffed and well-prepared, making it unlikely that Mers will be able to escape without some external help or a significant plot twist.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n\nI would rate this as: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Mers's attempted escape and subsequent capture by Crushak. The use of vivid language, such as the description of Crushak's ugliness and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes for Mers. The fact that Kalweitz leaves Mers alone with Crushak, implying that something unpleasant may happen to him, also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere. Overall, the passage effectively creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen"
