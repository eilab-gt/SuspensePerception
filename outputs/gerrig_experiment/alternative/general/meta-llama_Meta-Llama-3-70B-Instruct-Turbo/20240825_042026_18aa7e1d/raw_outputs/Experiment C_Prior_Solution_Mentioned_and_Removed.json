"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught by Crushak, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot Mers if he even attempts to speak to him suggests that Kalweitz has taken extra precautions to prevent another escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being trapped and helpless, and Crushak's menacing presence and orders to shoot Mers if he speaks. The fact that Mers has already tried to escape once and failed adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The passage effectively builds suspense and leaves the reader wondering what will happen next."
