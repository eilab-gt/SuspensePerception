"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage shows Mers being overpowered and disarmed by Chifrex and his gunmen, and Mers himself feels \"puny and impotent\". This suggests that Mers is in a difficult situation and escape seems unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage starts with a sense of normalcy and relaxation (Mers getting ready for dinner), but suddenly takes a dramatic turn with the burst of violence and Mers being overpowered. The use of action words like \"burst\", \"leapt\", \"whirled\", and \"crashed\" creates a sense of urgency and tension, making the passage suspenseful. The fact that Mers is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies adds to the suspense."
