"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has just been caught and disarmed by Chifrex's gunmen, and is now at their mercy. While Mers is resourceful and has managed to secretly move his fountain pen into his breast pocket, the situation seems to be heavily against him.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers making a desperate attempt to rescue Vesper and then being caught and disarmed. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"slammed\", \"whistled\", and \"crashed\" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, and whether Mers will be able to escape from Chifrex's clutches."
