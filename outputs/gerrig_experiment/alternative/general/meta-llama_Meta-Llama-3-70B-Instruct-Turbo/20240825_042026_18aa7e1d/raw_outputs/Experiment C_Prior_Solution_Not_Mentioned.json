"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was thwarted by Crushak. He is now tied up with piano wire, which seems to be a secure restraint. The situation looks bleak for Mers.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted, and then being tied up and left at the mercy of Kalweitz and Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"very large and very ugly man\" and the \"painfully\" biting piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape."
