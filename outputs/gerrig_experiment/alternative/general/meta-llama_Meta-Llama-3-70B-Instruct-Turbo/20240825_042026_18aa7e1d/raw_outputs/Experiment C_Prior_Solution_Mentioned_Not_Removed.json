"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire. The presence of the large and ugly Mr. Crushak, who is devoted to eliminating irritations from Kalweitz's life, makes it seem even more unlikely that Mers will escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being held captive and threatened by Kalweitz and Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense. The fact that Mers has already tried to escape once and failed makes the reader wonder if he will be able to escape again, and the threat of Crushak's devotion to eliminating irritations from Kalweitz's life raises the stakes."
