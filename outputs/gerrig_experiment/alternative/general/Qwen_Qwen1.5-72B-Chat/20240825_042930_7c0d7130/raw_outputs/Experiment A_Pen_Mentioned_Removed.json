Somewhat likely\n\nMers demonstrates resourcefulness and quick thinking by attempting to attack the gunmen and communicate with Vesper.

Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension and fast-paced action as Mers makes a bold move to save Vesper, only to be outmaneuvered by Chifrex and his men.
