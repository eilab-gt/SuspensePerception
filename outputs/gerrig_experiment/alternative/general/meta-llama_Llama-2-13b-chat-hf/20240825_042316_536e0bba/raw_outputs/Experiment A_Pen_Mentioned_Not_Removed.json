"  Based on the passage, here are my answers to your questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would rate the likelihood of Mers escaping from Chifrex as \"somewhat likely\". Although Chifrex and his gunmen have the upper hand and have taken Mers and Vesper prisoner, Mers has shown resourcefulness and agility in his attempts to escape. He has already kicked one of the gunmen and rolled agilely to avoid being shot. Additionally, Mers has managed to keep his fountain pen in his breast pocket, which could potentially be used as a weapon.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would rate the suspense level of this passage as \"moderately suspenseful\". The situation is tense and dangerous for Mers and Vesper, as they are being held captive by Chifrex and his gunmen. The passage is full of action and movement, with Mers trying to escape and Chifrex and his associates trying to stop him."
