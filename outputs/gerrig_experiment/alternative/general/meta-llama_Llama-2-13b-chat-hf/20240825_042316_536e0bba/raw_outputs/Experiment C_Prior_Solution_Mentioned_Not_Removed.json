"  Based on the passage, here are the answers to your questions:\n\n**Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?**\n\nI would rate the likelihood of Mers escaping from Kalweitz as \"not very likely.\" The passage states that Crushak is \"devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life,\" and that he is responsible for keeping Mers captive this time around. Additionally, Mers is currently tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which suggests that he is not in a position to easily escape.\n\n**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**\n\nI would rate the suspense level of this passage as \"very suspenseful.\" The passage is full of tension and danger, with Mers being held captive by Kalweitz and Crushak, and the threat of violence hanging over him. The use of the large and ugly man, Crushak, as a captor adds to the sense of danger and menace. Additionally, the mention of the previous guard who died in an automobile accident adds to the sense of danger"
