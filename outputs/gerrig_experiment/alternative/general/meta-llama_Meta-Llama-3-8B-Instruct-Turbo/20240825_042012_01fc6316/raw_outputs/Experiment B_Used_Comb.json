Mers has been caught off guard and is now trapped with no clear means of escape. Chifrex and his gunmen have the upper hand, and Mers is at their mercy.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The sudden and unexpected burst of the door, the intense action, and the sense of Mers's vulnerability and helplessness all contribute to a high level of suspense.
