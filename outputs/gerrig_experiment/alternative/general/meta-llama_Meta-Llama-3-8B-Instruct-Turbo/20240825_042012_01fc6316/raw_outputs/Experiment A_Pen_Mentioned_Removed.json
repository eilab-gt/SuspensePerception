"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers has been caught and disarmed by Chifrex and his gunmen, and it seems that Chifrex has a plan to keep Mers and Vesper captive. Mers's attempts to escape and cause damage to the gunmen have been foiled, and he is now at the mercy of Chifrex.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Mers is trying to escape from Chifrex and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language, such as \"Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage\" and \"As he crashed to the ground, Mers rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket\" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Mers. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Mers will be able to escape or not.<|eot_id|>"
