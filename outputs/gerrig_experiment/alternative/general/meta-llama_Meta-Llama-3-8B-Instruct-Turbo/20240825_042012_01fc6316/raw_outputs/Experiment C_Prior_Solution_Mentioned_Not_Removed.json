"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers is currently tied up and helpless, and Kalweitz has a large and formidable gunman, Crushak, guarding him. The situation seems dire for Mers, and it's unclear how he would manage to escape given his current circumstances.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Mers being trapped and helpless, and Kalweitz's ominous threats and the presence of Crushak creating a sense of foreboding. The sudden interruption by the bird and the subsequent chaos also adds to the suspense. Overall, the passage effectively builds a sense of tension and uncertainty, making it very suspenseful."
