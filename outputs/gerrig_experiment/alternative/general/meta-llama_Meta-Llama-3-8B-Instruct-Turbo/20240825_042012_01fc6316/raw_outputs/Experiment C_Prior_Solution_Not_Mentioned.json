"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers is currently tied up in a chair with piano wire, and Kalweitz has a large and ugly gunman, Crushak, guarding him. The situation seems quite dire for Mers, and it's unclear how he would be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, such as Mers's attempt to escape, the crash of the bird into the glass wall, and the introduction of Crushak as a formidable opponent. The use of vivid descriptions, such as \"very large and very ugly\", also adds to the suspense. The passage creates a sense of urgency and danger, making it a thrilling and suspenseful read."
