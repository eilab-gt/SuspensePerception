"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers has been caught by Chifrex and his gunmen, and they seem to have him under control. He has been disarmed and is being held at gunpoint. It's unlikely that he will be able to escape without some kind of plan or help.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dangerous situation. Mers is trying to escape and cause damage to the gunmen, but he is being thwarted at every turn. The use of descriptive language, such as \"like lightning\" and \"very quickly, but somehow delicately\", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Mers will be able to escape or if he will be caught and harmed."
