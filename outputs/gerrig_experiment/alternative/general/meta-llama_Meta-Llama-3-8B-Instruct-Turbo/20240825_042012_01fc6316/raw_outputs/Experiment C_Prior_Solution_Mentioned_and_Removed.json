"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers is currently trapped in a wooden armchair, pinned down by piano wire, and has a gun pointed at him by Crushak. Kalweitz has also made it clear that Crushak has orders to shoot Mers if he tries to escape or speak to him. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Mers. The reader is aware that Mers is trapped and at the mercy of Kalweitz and Crushak, and that any attempt to escape or resist will likely result in harm or death. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"large and very ugly\" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and suspense."
