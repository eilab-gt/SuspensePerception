"**Question 1:**\nBased on the passage, it is difficult to determine how likely it is that Mers will escape from Chifrex. The passage describes Mers as \"extremely likely\" to be trapped and \"unharmed,\" which suggests that he has been successful in defeating Chifrex. However, the passage does not provide any information about Mers' ability to escape or his escape strategy. Therefore, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether Mers will escape from Chifrex or not."
