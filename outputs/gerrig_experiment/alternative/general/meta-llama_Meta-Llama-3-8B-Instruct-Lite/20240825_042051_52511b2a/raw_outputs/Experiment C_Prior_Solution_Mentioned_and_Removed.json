"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Mers is in a precarious situation, trapped in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and legs, and with a large and ugly man, Crushak, guarding him. Kalweitz has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Mers if he tries to escape or speak to him. This suggests that Mers' chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is extremely suspenseful due to the intense and dire situation Mers finds himself in. The reader is left wondering how Mers will manage to escape or if he will be able to outwit his captors. The vivid descriptions of the setting, the menacing tone of the characters, and the sense of danger and confinement all contribute to a sense of high tension and suspense."
