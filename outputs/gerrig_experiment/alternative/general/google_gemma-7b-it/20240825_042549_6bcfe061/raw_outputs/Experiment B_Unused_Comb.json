"The passage describes a scene where Mers is trapped by Chifrex and his two gunmen. It is a suspenseful scene, as it is clear that Mers is in danger. However, the passage does not provide any information about Mers's escape or his ability to overcome this situation. Therefore, I cannot answer the question of whether Mers is likely to escape from Chifrex."
