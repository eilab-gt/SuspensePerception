"Here are my answers based on the provided passage:\n\n**Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?**\n\n**Answer:** 1. **Not very likely** \n\n**Reasoning:** Mers has been caught in a much more dangerous situation this time. Kalweitz is clearly more prepared and has a ruthless enforcer in Crushak. The passage emphasizes the danger Mers is in with the description of Crushak's appearance and his willingness to use violence.\n\n**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**\n\n**Answer:** 5. **Moderately suspenseful**\n\n**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. Mers's initial attempt to escape is thwarted, and the introduction of Crushak and the graphic description of his actions create a sense of impending danger.  The threat to Mers's life and the mention of the previous guard's death add to the suspense. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to discuss this further! \n"
