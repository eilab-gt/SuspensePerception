"Here are my assessments based on the provided excerpt:\n\n**Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?**\n\n**Answer: 1. Not very likely**\n\n**Reasoning:**  The passage clearly establishes that Mers is now in a much more dangerous situation than before. He's been caught off guard, trapped physically, and Kalweitz has introduced a ruthless enforcer, Crushak, who is explicitly instructed to kill Mers if he even tries to communicate. \n\n**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**\n\n**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**\n\n**Reasoning:**  The passage builds suspense effectively:\n\n* **Initial False Hope:** Mers's quick thinking creates a brief moment of optimism, but it's quickly dashed.\n* **Escalating Threat:** The introduction of Crushak and his brutal methods raises the stakes considerably.\n* **Direct Threat:** Kalweitz's statement about Crushak's orders adds a palpable sense of danger.\n* **Mers's Powerlessness:** Mers is physically restrained and unable to defend himself, leaving the reader anxious about his fate.\n\n\nThe combination of these"
