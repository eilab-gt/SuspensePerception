"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Mers escaping from Kalweitz. Mers has shown resourcefulness by using the distraction of the bird crashing into the window to create an opportunity for escape. However, he is stopped by Crushak, who ties him up with piano wire. The situation is tense, and Mers's fate is uncertain.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful due to the sudden turn of events and the immediate danger that Mers faces. The unexpected crash of the bird into the window, Mers's attempt to escape, and his subsequent capture by Crushak create a sense of urgency and tension. The description of Crushak's appearance and the painful method of tying Mers up with piano wire add to the suspenseful atmosphere. The uncertainty of Mers's fate and the ominous tone of Kalweitz's words further contribute to the overall suspense."
