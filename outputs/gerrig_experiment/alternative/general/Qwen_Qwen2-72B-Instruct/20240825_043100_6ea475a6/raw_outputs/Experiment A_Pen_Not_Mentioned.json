"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nExplanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Mers escaping. Mers is currently outnumbered and outgunned, with Chifrex and his two gunmen in control. However, Mers has shown some agility and quick thinking, which could potentially aid him in an escape attempt. Without further context, it is uncertain how likely an escape would be.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nExplanation: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the immediate danger Mers and Vesper are in. Mers has just made a sudden and violent move to follow Vesper, and the description of his actions and the reactions of Chifrex and his men create a sense of urgency and tension. The fact that Mers is disarmed and under the control of his enemies adds to the suspense, as the outcome is uncertain and potentially dire."
