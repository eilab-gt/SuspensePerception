"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, as Mers is captured and disarmed by Chifrex and his men. Mers's sudden decision to act and his attempt to reach Vesper add a sense of urgency and danger to the scene. The fact that Chifrex seems to be one step ahead of Mers, anticipating his moves and taking away his potential weapons, including the fountain pen, increases the suspense as it leaves Mers in a seemingly more vulnerable position. The outcome of Mers's situation is uncertain, contributing to the high level of suspense."
