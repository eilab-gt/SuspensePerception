"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Mers escaping from Kalweitz. Mers has shown resourcefulness in the past, as evidenced by his ability to outwit Kalweitz's guard previously, but he is now in a more precarious situation with the involvement of Crushak, who seems to be a formidable adversary. The outcome is uncertain, making the likelihood of escape neutral.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful due to the escalating tension and danger faced by Mers. The unexpected crash of the bird into the window, Mers's quick thinking, and the subsequent appearance of Crushak with a gun all contribute to a sense of imminent peril. The detail of Mers being tied up with piano wire that bites into his flesh adds to the intensity of the situation. The mention of Kalweitz's previous guard dying in an automobile accident also implies that Mers's life is in serious danger, heightening the suspense."
