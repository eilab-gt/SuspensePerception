Not very likely\n\nMers's attempt to escape is thwarted by Chifrex's quick thinking and agility. Chifrex catches Mers's shoe, and Mers is subsequently disarmed and searched. This suggests that Mers's chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and urgency. Mers is trying to escape, but Chifrex is one step ahead of him.

The reader is left wondering how Mers will get out of this situation, and the outcome is far from certain."
