"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers is trapped in the hotel room with three men, including Chifrex, who have guns drawn. He has already been disarmed and searched, and Chifrex has taken his comb, which suggests that he is in a position of control. This makes it unlikely that Mers will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it starts with a sense of normalcy and confidence, but quickly turns into a dramatic and intense situation. Mers is ambushed and disarmed, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid language and the description of Mers's emotions (\"Mers felt puny and impotent\") adds to the sense of tension and suspense."
