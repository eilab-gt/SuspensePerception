"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers's attempt to escape was quickly thwarted by Chifrex's assistant, who caught his shoe and twisted it, causing him to fall. The two gunmen then dragged him to his feet and disarmed him, making it unlikely that he will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and urgency. Mers's attempt to escape is quickly foiled, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of active verbs like \"hurled\", \"connected\", \"slammed\", and \"twisted\" creates a sense of rapid action, and the fact that Mers is disarmed and at the mercy of Chifrex and his men adds to the suspense."
