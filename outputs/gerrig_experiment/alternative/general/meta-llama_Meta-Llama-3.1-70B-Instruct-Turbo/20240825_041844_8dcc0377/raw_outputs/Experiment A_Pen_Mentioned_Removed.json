"Based on the passage, here are my answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would choose: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers is currently a prisoner and has been disarmed, he has already shown his resourcefulness and agility in attempting to escape and in hiding his fountain pen. This suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve, and his determination to escape and protect Vesper is evident.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tension and action, with Mers's sudden decision to escape, the quick and violent confrontation with the Corsican, and the subsequent search and disarmament of Mers. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and the ominous tone set by Chifrex's words (\"Let's not waste time\") suggests that Mers and Vesper are in grave danger. The passage effectively builds suspense and raises questions about how Mers will manage to escape and what Chifrex has planned for him."
