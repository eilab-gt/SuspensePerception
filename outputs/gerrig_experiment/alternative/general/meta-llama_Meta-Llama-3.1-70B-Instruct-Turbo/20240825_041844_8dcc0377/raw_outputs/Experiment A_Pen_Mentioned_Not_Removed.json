"Here are my answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would choose option 2: Somewhat likely.\n\nAlthough Mers has been caught and disarmed, he seems to be a resourceful and agile character who is able to think on his feet. He has also managed to secretly move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, which may be a hint that he has a plan or a hidden advantage. However, he is currently at a disadvantage, being outnumbered and outgunned, so his chances of escape are not extremely high.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful.\n\nThe passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Mers's sudden decision to make a break for it, the Corsican's swift and effective counterattack, and the rough handling of Mers by the gunmen. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, and whether Mers will be able to escape or outwit his captors. The passage also raises questions about Mers's plan and the significance of the fountain pen"
