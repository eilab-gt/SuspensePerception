"Based on this new passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would answer: 3. Slightly likely\n\nAlthough Mers showed some agility and quick thinking in his initial reaction to the attack, he was ultimately overpowered and disarmed. The fact that he feels \"puny and impotent\" suggests that he may not have a clear plan for escape, and the presence of three armed men makes it a challenging situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is quite suspenseful, as it starts with a sense of normalcy and calm (Mers getting ready for dinner) and then suddenly shifts to a violent and intense confrontation. The use of action verbs like \"burst\", \"leapt\", and \"twisted\" creates a sense of urgency and danger, and the fact that Mers is overpowered and disarmed raises the stakes and creates tension. The passage ends with Mers feeling helpless, which adds to the sense of suspense and uncertainty."
