"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers has just been caught and disarmed by Chifrex's men, and is now at their mercy. Chifrex seems to be in control of the situation, and Mers's attempt to escape or cause damage has been quickly thwarted. This implies that Mers's chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, with Mers attempting to escape and being caught, and Chifrex exerting his control over the situation. The use of action verbs like \"hurled\", \"slammed\", and \"twisted\" creates a sense of urgency and violence, and the fact that Mers is now at the mercy of his captors raises the stakes and creates suspense. The passage effectively builds tension and sets the stage for a potentially intense confrontation."
