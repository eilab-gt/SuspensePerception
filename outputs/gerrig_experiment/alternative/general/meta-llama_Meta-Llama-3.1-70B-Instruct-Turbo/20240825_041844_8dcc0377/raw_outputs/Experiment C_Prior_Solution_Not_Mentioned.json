"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nI would choose option 2: Somewhat likely. Although Mers has been caught and tied up, he has already shown his resourcefulness and quick thinking by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall. This suggests that he may still have a chance to escape, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Mers in a precarious situation and Kalweitz's menacing tone. The use of vivid imagery, such as the bird crashing into the wall and the ugly face of Crushak, adds to the sense of tension. The fact that Mers is tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about how Mers will escape, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story."
