"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is at a significant disadvantage, having been overpowered and disarmed by Chifrex and his men. Despite his initial attempt to defend himself, Mers is ultimately trapped and feels \"puny and impotent\". This implies that his chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of sudden and unexpected danger, as Mers is ambushed by Chifrex and his men. The use of action-packed language, such as \"the door burst in toward him\" and \"Mers suddenly whirled around\", adds to the tension. The fact that Mers is overpowered and disarmed also raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next."
