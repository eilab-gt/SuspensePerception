"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers has been captured and tied up, his previous success in outwitting Kalweitz's guard suggests that he may still have a chance to escape. Additionally, the fact that Kalweitz is taking extra precautions to ensure Mers doesn't escape implies that Mers is a formidable opponent.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Mers being held captive and threatened by Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"very large and very ugly man\" and the painful piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and urgency. The fact that Mers has a history of escaping from Kalweitz's clutches also raises the stakes and creates tension, making the reader wonder if he will be able to escape again."
