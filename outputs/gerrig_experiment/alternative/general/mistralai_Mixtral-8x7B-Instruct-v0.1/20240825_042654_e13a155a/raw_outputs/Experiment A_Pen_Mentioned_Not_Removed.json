" Question 1: Based on the passage, I would choose \"1. Not very likely\" for the likelihood of Mers escaping from Chifrex. At this point in the story, Mers has been overpowered and disarmed, making it challenging for him to escape on his own.\n\nQuestion 2: For the suspense level of the passage, I would choose \"5. Moderately suspenseful\". The passage contains action and tension, with Mers attempting to escape and being caught by Chifrex and his gunmen. However, the suspense is not at its highest level because Mers' escape attempt has failed, and the focus shifts to what will happen next."
