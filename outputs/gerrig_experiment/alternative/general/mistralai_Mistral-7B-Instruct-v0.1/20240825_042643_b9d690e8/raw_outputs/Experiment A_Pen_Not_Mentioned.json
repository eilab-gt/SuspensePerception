" Based on the passage, it is unclear how likely Mers is to escape from Chifrex. The passage does not provide any information about Mers' plan or ability to escape, and it is unclear if he has any allies or resources that could help him. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the likelihood of his escape.\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful. There are several tense moments, such as when Mers is shot at and when he is being searched for weapons. However, there is also some dialogue and action that helps to break up the tension and keep the reader engaged. Overall, the passage is suspenseful but not extremely so."
