" Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Mers is not very likely to escape from Kalweitz. He has been captured and is being held in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms. Additionally, there are two gunmen present who are guarding him.\n\nQuestion 2: The passage is moderately suspenseful. There is tension in the scene as Mers tries to escape and is confronted by two gunmen. The distraction of the bird crashing into the wall of glass adds to the suspense, but the overall tone of the passage is more ominous than suspenseful."
