"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n3. Slightly likely\nMers has shown some resourcefulness by attempting to fight back and protect Vesper, but he is quickly overpowered and disarmed. The fact that he tries to ensure his fountain pen, which could potentially be a tool for escape or defense, goes unnoticed suggests he's still looking for opportunities. However, given the current situation, with Chifrex and his gunmen in control, the odds are slightly in favor of Mers finding a way out, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n5. Moderately suspenseful\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful as it describes a tense moment of capture and resistance. Mers's attempt to intervene and the subsequent defeat, along with the detail of trying to protect his fountain pen, creates a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about his fate and whether he will find a way to turn the tables. The actions and dialogue contribute to a feeling that the situation is on a knife-edge, keeping the reader engaged and wondering about the outcome."
