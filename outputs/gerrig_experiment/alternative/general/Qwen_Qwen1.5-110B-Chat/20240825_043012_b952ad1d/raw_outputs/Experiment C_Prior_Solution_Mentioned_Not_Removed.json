"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nGiven the passage, Mers has already attempted an escape and failed, being captured and restrained with piano wire. However, Mers has shown resourcefulness in the past by using the bird's distraction to try to get away. The outcome is uncertain as we don't know the full extent of Mers's abilities or if there will be another opportunity for escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a moderate level of suspense through the tense situation, the sudden action with the bird crashing into the window, and Mers's failed attempt to escape. The threat posed by Kalweitz and the imposing figure of Crushak, along with the description of Mers being tied up, adds to the suspense. However, it's not at an extreme level as the outcome is not immediately clear, and there's a hint of Mers's potential for future resourcefulness."
