"  Based on the passage, it seems that Mers is in a difficult situation, being held captive by Chifrex and his two gunmen. However, Mers has shown himself to be resourceful and skilled in combat, able to take down one of the gunmen with a well-placed shove. It's possible that Mers may use his skills to escape from Chifrex, but it's also clear that Chifrex has the upper hand at the moment.\n\nTherefore, I would rate the likelihood of Mers escaping from Chifrex as moderately likely (5). While Mers has shown himself to be capable, Chifrex has already demonstrated that he is a formidable opponent, and Mers is currently at his mercy.\n\nAs for the suspense level of the passage, it seems that the situation is quite tense, with Mers being held captive and Chifrex clearly having the upper hand. The passage also ends on a cliffhanger, with Chifrex about to take Mers away, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next. Therefore, I would rate the suspense"
