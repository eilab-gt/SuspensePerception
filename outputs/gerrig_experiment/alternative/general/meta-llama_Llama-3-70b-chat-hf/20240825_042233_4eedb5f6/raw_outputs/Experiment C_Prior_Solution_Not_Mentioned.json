"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Mers has shown some resourcefulness by trying to distract Kalweitz and escape, he has ultimately been caught and tied up by Crushak. The situation looks bleak for Mers, but it's possible that he might still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted by Kalweitz and Crushak. The use of vivid details, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape."
