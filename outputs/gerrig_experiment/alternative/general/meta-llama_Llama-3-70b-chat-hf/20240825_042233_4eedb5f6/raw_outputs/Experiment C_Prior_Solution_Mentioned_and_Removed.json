"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught by Crushak, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot him if he even attempts to speak to him suggests that Kalweitz has taken extra precautions to prevent Mers from escaping again.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the bird crashing into the glass wall to Mers's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's ugly face and his orders to shoot Mers if he speaks to him adds to the sense of danger and tension. The reader is left wondering how Mers will manage to escape from this precarious situation."
