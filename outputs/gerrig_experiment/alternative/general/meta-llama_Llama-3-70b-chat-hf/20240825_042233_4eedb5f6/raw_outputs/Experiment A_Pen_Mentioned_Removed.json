"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Mers is a resourceful character who has already shown some quick thinking and agility, he is currently at a disadvantage, being held captive by Chifrex and his gunmen. However, the fact that he was able to subtly move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Mers's sudden decision to act, the Corsican's quick reflexes, and the rough treatment by the gunmen. The sense of danger and urgency is palpable, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next to Mers and Vesper."
