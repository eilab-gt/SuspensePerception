"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage shows Mers being overpowered and trapped by Chifrex and his gunmen. Despite Mers's initial attempt to resist, he is quickly subdued and disarmed. Chifrex seems to be in control, and Mers is described as feeling \"puny and impotent\".\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful, as it starts with a sense of normalcy (Mers getting ready for dinner) and then suddenly turns into a violent and intense scene. The use of words like \"burst\", \"leapt\", and \"sharply\" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, and whether they will be able to escape from Chifrex's clutches."
