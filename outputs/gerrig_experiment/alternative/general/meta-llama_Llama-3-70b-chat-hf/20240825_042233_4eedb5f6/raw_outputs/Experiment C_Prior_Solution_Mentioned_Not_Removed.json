"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers has been caught and tied up, he has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past (e.g., pulling up the rug to distract Kalweitz). This suggests that he may still find a way to escape, but it's not a certainty.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being held captive and threatened by Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the contorted smile on Crushak's face, adds to the sense of unease. The fact that Mers is tied up and at the mercy of his captors raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, making the passage very suspenseful."
