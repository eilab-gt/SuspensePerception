"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has just been caught and disarmed by Chifrex's gunmen, and is currently at their mercy. While Mers is shown to be agile and resourceful, the situation seems to be heavily against him.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Mers's sudden decision to act, the Corsican's quick reflexes, and the rough treatment of Mers by the gunmen. The sense of danger and uncertainty is palpable, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next."
