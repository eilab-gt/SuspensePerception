"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is now trapped and helpless, with his arms pinned by piano wire and a large and ugly gunman, Crushak, watching over him. Additionally, Kalweitz has explicitly stated that Crushak has orders to shoot Mers if he tries to speak to him, making it seem unlikely that Mers will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and helpless, and the reader is aware that he is in grave danger. The description of Crushak as \"very large and very ugly\" adds to the sense of unease, and Kalweitz's cold and calculating demeanor makes him a formidable and intimidating figure. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Mers next, which keeps the reader engaged and curious."
