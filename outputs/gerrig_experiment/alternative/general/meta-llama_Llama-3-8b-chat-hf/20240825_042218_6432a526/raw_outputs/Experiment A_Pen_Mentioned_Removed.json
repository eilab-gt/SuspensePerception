"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has been caught and disarmed by Chifrex and his gunmen, and he seems to be at their mercy. The fact that Chifrex has taken away Mers's fountain pen, which might have been a potential tool for escape or self-defense, suggests that Mers's chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers trying to escape and Chifrex trying to capture him. The use of vivid language, such as \"like lightning\" and \"whistle of pain\", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Mers is being disarmed and captured, despite his best efforts to resist, creates a sense of inevitability and raises questions about what will happen to him next, making the passage very suspenseful."
