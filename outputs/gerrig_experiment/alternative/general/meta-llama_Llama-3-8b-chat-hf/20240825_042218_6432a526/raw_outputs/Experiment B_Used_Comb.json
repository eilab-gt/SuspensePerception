"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: \"Not very likely\". Mers has been caught off guard, and despite his agility and quick thinking, he has been disarmed and is now trapped. Chifrex and his gunmen seem to have the upper hand, and Mers's attempts to escape seem uncertain at this point.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: \"Very suspenseful\". The passage is full of unexpected twists and turns, starting with the sudden burst of the door and the appearance of Chifrex and his gunmen. The description of Mers's quick thinking and agility adds to the suspense, but the fact that he is still trapped and disarmed creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The passage effectively builds suspense by leaving the reader wondering how Mers will manage to escape from his predicament."
