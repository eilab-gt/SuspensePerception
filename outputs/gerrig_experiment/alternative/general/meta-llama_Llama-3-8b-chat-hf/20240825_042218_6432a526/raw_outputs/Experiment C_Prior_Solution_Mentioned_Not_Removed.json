"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers is currently trapped, pinned down by piano wire, and facing a large and ugly gunman, Crushak. Kalweitz has also made it clear that Crushak is devoted to eliminating any irritations from his life, implying that Mers is in a precarious situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Mers being trapped, threatened, and subjected to physical pain. The introduction of the large bird crashing into the wall adds an element of surprise, and the revelation that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations creates a sense of foreboding. The overall atmosphere is dark and ominous, making it a very suspenseful passage."
