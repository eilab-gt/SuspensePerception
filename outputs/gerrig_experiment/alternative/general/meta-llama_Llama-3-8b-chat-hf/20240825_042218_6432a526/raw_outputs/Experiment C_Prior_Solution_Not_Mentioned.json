"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers is currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. The situation seems dire, and Mers' previous attempts to escape have been foiled. It's unlikely that he will be able to escape in the immediate future.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape or what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Mers and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape or survive their ordeal."
