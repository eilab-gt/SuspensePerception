"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI choose: 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is in a precarious situation, tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. The fact that Crushak is described as \"devoted to eliminating such irritations from [Kalweitz's] life\" implies that Mers is in grave danger and escape seems unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI choose: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful, with a sudden and unexpected event (the bird crashing into the glass wall) that creates tension, followed by a brief moment of hope for Mers' escape, only to be thwarted by Crushak's intervention. The description of Crushak's ugly appearance and menacing behavior adds to the sense of danger and suspense. The passage effectively creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen to Mers next."
