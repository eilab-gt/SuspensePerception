"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1. Not very likely. The passage describes Mers being tied up and guarded by a large and ugly man, Crushak, who has orders to shoot Mers if he even attempts to speak. This suggests that Mers is in a precarious and trapped situation, making escape unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being captured and tied up, and the threat of being shot if he tries to escape or even speak. The description of Crushak as \"very large and very ugly\" adds to the sense of menace, and the fact that Mers is being held captive by a criminal figure like Kalweitz raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The passage effectively builds suspense and leaves the reader wondering what will happen to Mers next."
