"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is currently trapped and at the mercy of Chifrex and his gunmen. Although Mers has shown some agility and quick thinking, he has been disarmed and is currently being held captive. There is no indication that he has a plan to escape or that he has any advantages that would allow him to break free.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful because it starts with a sense of normalcy (Mers getting ready for dinner) and then suddenly takes a dramatic turn with the burst of violence and Mers being overpowered. The scene is intense and action-packed, with a sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and how he will get out of this situation."
