"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Mers being caught and disarmed by Chifrex's men, and it seems that Chifrex is in control of the situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with action and tension, with Mers trying to escape and being caught, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"slammed\", \"whistled\", and \"barked\" adds to the sense of urgency and energy, making the passage very suspenseful."
