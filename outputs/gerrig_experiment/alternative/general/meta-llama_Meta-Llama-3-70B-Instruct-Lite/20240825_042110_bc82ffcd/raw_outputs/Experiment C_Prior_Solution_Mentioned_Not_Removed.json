"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Mers being tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak, with no obvious means of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the wall to Mers's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's ugly face and the painful binding of Mers's arms with piano wire adds to the sense of danger and tension, making the passage very suspenseful."
