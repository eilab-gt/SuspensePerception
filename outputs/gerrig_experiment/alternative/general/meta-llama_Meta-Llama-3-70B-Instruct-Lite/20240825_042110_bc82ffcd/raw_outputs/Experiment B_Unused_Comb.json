"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage describes Mers as \"trapped\" and \"puny and impotent\", indicating that he is currently at a disadvantage and unable to escape. Although Mers has shown some agility and quick thinking, he is outnumbered and outgunned, making escape seem unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it starts with a sense of confidence and normalcy (Mers getting ready for dinner), but suddenly takes a dramatic turn with the burst of violence and Mers's capture. The use of vivid action descriptions and the sense of danger and tension create a sense of suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen to Mers next."
