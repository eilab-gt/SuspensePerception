"Based on the passage, I'd answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Mers being captured and searched by Chifrex's gunmen, and it seems that Chifrex has the upper hand. Mers's attempt to escape or cause damage has been thwarted, and he is now at Chifrex's mercy.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Mers trying to escape and being caught, and the threat of violence is palpable. The use of vivid language, such as \"whistle of pain\", \"slammed himself back against the wall\", and \"crashed to the ground\", adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next."
