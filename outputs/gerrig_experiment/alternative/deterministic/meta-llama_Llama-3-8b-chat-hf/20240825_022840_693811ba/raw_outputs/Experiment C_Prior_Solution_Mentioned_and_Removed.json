"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers is currently trapped in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms, and Crushak has orders to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. Kalweitz also seems to have a history of successfully capturing and holding Mers, and Crushak appears to be a formidable and ruthless enforcer. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and helpless, and Kalweitz and Crushak are determined to keep him that way. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"large and very ugly\" Crushak, and the graphic details of Mers's confinement, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Mers next, such as whether he will be able to escape or if Crushak will carry out"
