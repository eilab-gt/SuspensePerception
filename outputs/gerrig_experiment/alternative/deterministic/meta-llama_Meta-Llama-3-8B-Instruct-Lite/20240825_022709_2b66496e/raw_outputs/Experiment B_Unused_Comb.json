Not very likely\n\nMers is trapped, and Chifrex has taken away his revolver and pocket comb, leaving him with no apparent means of defense or escape.

Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful because it sets up a sense of tension and danger. Mers, who was confident and triumphant just moments before, is now trapped and helpless.
