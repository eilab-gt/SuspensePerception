Not very likely\n\nMers is currently a prisoner of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak, and is being held in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and chair, which makes it difficult for him to escape. The situation seems dire for Mers.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, Mers. The reader is aware that Mers is in a precarious situation and is being held captive by a ruthless criminal, which creates a sense of unease and tension. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"large and very ugly\" man, Crushak, and the painful wrapping of piano wire around Mers's arms, adds to the suspense and creates a sense of foreboding. The passage is also building towards a potentially dire outcome for Mers, which makes it even more suspenseful."
