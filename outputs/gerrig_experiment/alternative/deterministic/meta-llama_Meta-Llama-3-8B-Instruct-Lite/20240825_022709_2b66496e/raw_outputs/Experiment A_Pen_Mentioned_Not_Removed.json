"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers has been caught by Chifrex and his two gunmen, and is being searched and disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape at this point.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where the protagonist, Mers, is being captured and disarmed by his enemy, Chifrex. The use of action-packed language, such as \"With a backward kick which connected with the thin man\u2019s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him\", and \"he crashed to the ground, Mers rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket\" creates a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape or not."
