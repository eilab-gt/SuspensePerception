"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers has been caught by Chifrex and his two gunmen, and they have taken away his revolver and fountain pen, which were his potential means of defense. It seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape from this situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will get out of it. The use of action-packed language, such as \"With a backward kick which connected with the thin man\u2019s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him\", and \"he crashed to the ground, Mers rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket\" adds to the suspense. The reader is also left wondering what will happen next, which keeps them engaged and interested."
