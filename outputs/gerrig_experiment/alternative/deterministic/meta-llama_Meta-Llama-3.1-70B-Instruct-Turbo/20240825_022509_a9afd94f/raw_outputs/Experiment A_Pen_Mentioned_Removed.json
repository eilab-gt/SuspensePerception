"Based on the passage, here are my answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers has been caught and disarmed, he has already shown his resourcefulness and agility in attempting to escape and trying to hide his fountain pen. This suggests that he may still have a plan or a trick up his sleeve, making his escape somewhat likely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, with Mers attempting to escape, being caught and disarmed, and Chifrex's sinister tone and actions creating a sense of danger and urgency. The fact that Mers's plan is not yet clear and that Chifrex seems to be one step ahead of him adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next."
