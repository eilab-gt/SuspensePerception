"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is currently at a disadvantage, having been caught and disarmed by Chifrex's men. Although Mers is resourceful and agile, the fact that he has been overpowered and is now at the mercy of his captors makes it unlikely that he will escape in the immediate future.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and urgency. Mers's attempt to escape and his subsequent capture raises the stakes, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The fact that Chifrex seems to be in control and is \"reading Mers's thoughts\" adds to the sense of danger and unpredictability, making the passage very suspenseful."
