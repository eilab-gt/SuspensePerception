"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught by Crushak, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot him if he even attempts to speak to him suggests that Kalweitz has taken extra precautions to prevent Mers from escaping again.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being held captive and threatened with death if he tries to escape or even speak to his captor. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding. The reader is left wondering how Mers will manage to escape from this precarious situation."
