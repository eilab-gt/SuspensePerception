"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already been caught and tied up by Kalweitz's henchman, Crushak, and is at their mercy. The situation seems quite dire for Mers.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted at every turn. The use of sudden events like the bird crashing into the window and the darkness of the office adds to the sense of uncertainty and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape from Kalweitz's clutches."
