"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught by Crushak, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire. The situation seems quite dire for Mers.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the bird crashing into the glass wall to Mers's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's ugly face and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Mers's arms adds to the sense of danger and suspense. The reader is left wondering if Mers will be able to escape again or if he will fall victim to Kalweitz's plans."
