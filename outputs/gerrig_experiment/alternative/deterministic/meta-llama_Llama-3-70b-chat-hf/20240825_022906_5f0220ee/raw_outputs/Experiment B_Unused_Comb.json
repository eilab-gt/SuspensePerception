"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Mers as being trapped and feeling \"puny and impotent\", which suggests that he is currently at a disadvantage and unlikely to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage starts with a sense of normalcy and relaxation, but suddenly takes a dramatic turn with the burst of violence and Mers's capture. The description of the search and Mers's feelings of impotence create a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the passage very suspenseful."
