"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Mers has shown some agility and quick thinking in his attempt to escape, he has been caught and disarmed by Chifrex's men. The situation seems to be against him, but Mers's resourcefulness and cunning might still give him a small chance to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers trying to escape and being caught, and Chifrex's men searching him for weapons. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"slammed\", \"whistled past\", and \"crashed to the ground\" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers and Vesper next, which adds to the suspense."
