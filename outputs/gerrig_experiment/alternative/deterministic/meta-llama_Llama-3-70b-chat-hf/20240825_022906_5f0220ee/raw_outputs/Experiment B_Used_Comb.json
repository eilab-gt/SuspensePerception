"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Mers as being trapped and feeling \"puny and impotent\", which suggests that he is currently at a disadvantage and unlikely to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and surprise, with the sudden burst of Chifrex and his gunmen into Mers's hotel room, followed by a brief but intense physical confrontation. The fact that Mers is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies adds to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next."
