"Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:\n\n**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"**\n\n**Answer:** 2. **Somewhat likely**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile Mers shows quick thinking and agility, he's outnumbered and outgunned. He manages to briefly evade capture but is quickly subdued. Chifrex seems to be in control and is actively taking steps to prevent Mers from escaping (taking his weapons, etc.). However, Mers's resourcefulness and the fact that Chifrex wants to \"not waste time\" suggest a possible opportunity for a clever escape attempt later.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n\n**Answer:** 6. **Very suspenseful**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe passage is filled with tension. Mers is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and facing a cunning opponent. The fast-paced action, descriptions of Mers's desperate attempts to escape, and Chifrex's menacing presence all contribute to a high level of suspense. The ending, with Chifrex taking Mers's pen, leaves the reader wondering what will happen next and whether Mers has any tricks up"
