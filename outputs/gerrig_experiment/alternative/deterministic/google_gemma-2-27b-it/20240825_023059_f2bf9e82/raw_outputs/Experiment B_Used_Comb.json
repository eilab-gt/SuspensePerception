"Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:\n\n**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"**\n\n**Answer:** 1. Not very likely\n\n**Explanation:** The passage describes Mers being overpowered and disarmed. Chifrex is in control, and Mers is described as feeling \"puny and impotent.\" This suggests a significant power imbalance and makes escape seem unlikely.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n\n**Answer:** 5. Moderately suspenseful\n\n**Explanation:** The passage creates suspense through the sudden ambush, Mers's initial struggle, and his eventual capture. The ending leaves the reader wondering what Chifrex's plans are and what will happen to Mers and Vesper. However, the passage doesn't provide enough information to make it extremely suspenseful. \n\n\n\n"
