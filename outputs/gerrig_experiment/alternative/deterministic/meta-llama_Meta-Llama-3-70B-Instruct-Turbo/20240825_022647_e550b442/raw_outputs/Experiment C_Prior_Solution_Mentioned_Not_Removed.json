"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught by Crushak, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire. The situation seems quite dire for Mers.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted, and the introduction of the menacing character Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the ugly face of Crushak, adds to the sense of suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape."
