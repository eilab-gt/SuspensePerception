"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire and being guarded by a large and intimidating man, Crushak, who has orders to shoot him if he even tries to speak.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being held captive and threatened by Kalweitz and Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering if Mers will be able to escape or if he will meet a dire fate."
