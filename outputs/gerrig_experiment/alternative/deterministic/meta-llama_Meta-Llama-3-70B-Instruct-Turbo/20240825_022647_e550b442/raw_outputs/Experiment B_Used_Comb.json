Mers has been caught off guard, disarmed, and is currently trapped with no apparent means of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of sudden and unexpected danger, with Mers being ambushed and overpowered by Chifrex and his gunmen.
