"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers has been caught and disarmed, he has shown agility and quick thinking in his attempt to escape and rescue Vesper. This suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve and could potentially find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because Mers is in a dangerous situation, being held at gunpoint and searched by Chifrex's henchmen. The reader is left wondering if Mers will be able to escape or if he will be harmed. The use of action-packed language, such as \"hurled himself\", \"slammed himself\", \"whistled past his hip\", and \"crashed to the ground\", adds to the sense of tension and urgency. The fact that Chifrex seems to be one step ahead of Mers, anticipating his thoughts and actions, also increases the sense of suspense."
