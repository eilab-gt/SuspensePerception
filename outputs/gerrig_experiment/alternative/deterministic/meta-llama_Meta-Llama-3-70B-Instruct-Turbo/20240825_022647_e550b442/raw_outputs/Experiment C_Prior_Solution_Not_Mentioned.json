"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught by Crushak. He is now tied up with piano wire, which seems to be a secure restraint. The situation looks bleak for Mers.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the initial confrontation between Mers and Kalweitz to the sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the window, and finally to Mers's failed escape attempt and subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's ugly face and the painful binding of Mers with piano wire adds to the sense of danger and tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape."
