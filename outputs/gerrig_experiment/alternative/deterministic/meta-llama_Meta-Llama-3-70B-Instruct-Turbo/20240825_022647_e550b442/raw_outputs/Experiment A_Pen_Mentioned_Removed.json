"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Mers has been caught and disarmed, he has shown resourcefulness and agility in his attempt to escape and has managed to move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, which might be a hint that he has a plan or a hidden weapon. This suggests that he may still have a chance to escape, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because Mers is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Chifrex and his gunmen. The scene is tense and action-packed, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The fact that Chifrex has taken away Mers's fountain pen, which might be a vital tool for his escape, adds to the sense of tension and suspense."
