"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"**\n1. Not very likely\n\nBased on the passage, Mers has just been captured and disarmed by Chifrex and his gunmen. Chifrex is described as being resourceful and having anticipated Mers's actions, as evidenced by the quick move to disarm Mers and take away his fountain pen. Mers's plan to cause damage and exchange words with Vesper has not been successful, and he is now at a disadvantage. Therefore, it is not very likely that Mers will escape at this point.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Mers, who has just made a daring attempt to rescue Vesper, has been caught off guard and disarmed. The tension is heightened by the Corsican's quick reflexes and the knowledge that Mers's fate and the outcome of the story hang in the balance. The mention of searching and the imminent \"let's not waste time\" suggests that the situation is escalating and the suspense is building."
