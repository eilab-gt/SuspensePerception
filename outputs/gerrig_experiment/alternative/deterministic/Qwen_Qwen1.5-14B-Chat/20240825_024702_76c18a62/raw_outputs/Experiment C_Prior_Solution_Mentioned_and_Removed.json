"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"**\n1. Not very likely\n2. Somewhat likely\n3. Slightly likely\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n5. Moderately likely\n6. Very likely\n7. Extremely likely\n\nBased on the passage, Mers has already attempted to escape once and was caught, leading to being tied up and threatened with a more vigilant guard. The situation seems to have escalated, making it less likely for a quick escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n6. Very suspenseful\n7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because Mers is in a dangerous situation, facing a gun-wielding Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. The unexpected distraction from the bird and Mers's attempt to escape create tension, and the description of Crushak's method of restraining Mers adds to the suspense. The threat of being shot if he speaks further heightens the suspense."
