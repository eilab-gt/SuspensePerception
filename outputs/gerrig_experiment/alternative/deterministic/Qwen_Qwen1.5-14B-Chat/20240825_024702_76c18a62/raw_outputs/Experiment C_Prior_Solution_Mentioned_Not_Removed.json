"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"**\n1. Not very likely\n2. Somewhat likely\n3. Slightly likely\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n5. Moderately likely\n6. Very likely\n7. Extremely likely\n\nBased on the passage, Mers has already attempted to escape once and was successful, but this time he is caught off guard and restrained more effectively. The presence of the large and intimidating Mr. Crushak, who is specifically tasked with eliminating \"irritations\" like Mers, suggests that the odds are against Mers's escape. Therefore, the answer is 1. Not very likely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n6. Very suspenseful\n7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because Mers, who has shown resourcefulness in the past, is now in a dire situation with Kalweitz and Crushak. The unexpected bird distraction and the escalating tension with Crushak's physical restraint create a sense of urgency and danger. The uncertainty of Mers's fate and the possibility of a confrontation make the passage highly suspenseful."
