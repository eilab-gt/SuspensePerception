"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers is currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. He has tried to escape once already, but was unsuccessful. The situation seems dire for Mers, and it's unlikely that he will be able to escape without some kind of outside help or a clever plan.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and at the mercy of his captors, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense and creates a sense of unease. The reader is left feeling anxious and worried about Mers' fate, which is a hallmark of a suspenseful passage."
