"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: \"Not very likely\". Mers has been caught off guard and is now trapped, with no clear means of escape. Chifrex and his gunmen seem to have the upper hand, and Mers is left feeling \"puny and impotent\".\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: \"Very suspenseful\". The passage is full of unexpected twists and turns, starting with the sudden burst of the door and the appearance of Chifrex and his gunmen. The action is fast-paced and intense, and the reader is left wondering how Mers will manage to escape from this precarious situation. The use of vivid descriptions and the sense of Mers's vulnerability and helplessness only adds to the suspense."
