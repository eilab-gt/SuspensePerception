"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers is currently tied up in a chair with piano wire, and Kalweitz has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot him if he tries to speak to him. Additionally, Crushak is a large and ugly man who seems to be a skilled enforcer. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is trapped and helpless, and Kalweitz and Crushak are determined to keep him that way. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and whether he will be able to escape or survive his captivity."
