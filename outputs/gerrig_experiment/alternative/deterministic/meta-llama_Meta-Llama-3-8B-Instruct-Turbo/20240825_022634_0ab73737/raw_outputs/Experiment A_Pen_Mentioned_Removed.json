"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers has been caught by Chifrex and his gunmen, and they have disarmed him. Chifrex has also taken away Mers's fountain pen, which might have been a potential tool for escape or defense. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape from Chifrex's clutches.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Mers is trying to escape from Chifrex's trap. The use of vivid language, such as \"Like lightning\" and \"whistled past his hip\", creates a sense of urgency and action. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Mers will be able to escape or not. The passage also raises questions about Chifrex's intentions and what he plans to do with Mers and Vesper, which adds to the suspense."
