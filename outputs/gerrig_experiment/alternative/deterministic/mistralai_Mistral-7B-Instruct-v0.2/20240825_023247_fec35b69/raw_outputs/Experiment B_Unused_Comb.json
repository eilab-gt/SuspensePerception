" Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems unlikely that Mers will escape from Chifrex at this point in time. He has been overpowered and is currently a prisoner of Chifrex and his gunmen.\n\nAs for the level of suspense in the passage, it is moderately suspenseful. The reader knows that Mers has been captured, but the outcome of the situation and what Chifrex intends to do with him is not yet clear. The use of descriptive language and the focus on Mers's feelings of impotence add to the suspense."
