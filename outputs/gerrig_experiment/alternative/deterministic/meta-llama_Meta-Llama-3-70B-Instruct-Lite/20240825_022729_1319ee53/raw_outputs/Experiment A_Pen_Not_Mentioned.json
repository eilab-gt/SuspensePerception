"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage shows Mers being overpowered by Chifrex's men, and despite his agility and quick thinking, he is still at their mercy.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action, with Mers trying to escape and being caught, and the tension is palpable. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"slammed\", \"whistled\", and \"barked\" adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful."
