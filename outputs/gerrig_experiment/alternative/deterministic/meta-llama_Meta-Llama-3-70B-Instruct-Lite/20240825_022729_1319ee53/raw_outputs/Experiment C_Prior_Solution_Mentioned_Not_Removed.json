"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage suggests that Mers is securely tied up and guarded by a large and intimidating man, Crushak, who is devoted to eliminating irritations from Kalweitz's life. Mers's previous escape attempt was successful, but it's unclear if he can repeat that success in this situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers being captured and tied up, and Crushak's menacing presence. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"very large and very ugly man\" and the \"painfully\" twisting piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering if Mers will be able to escape or if he will fall victim to Kalweitz's plans."
