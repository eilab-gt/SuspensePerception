"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Mers as feeling \"puny and impotent\" and being trapped by Chifrex and his gunmen, which suggests that his chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage builds tension from the moment the door bursts open and the gunmen enter, and the action unfolds quickly and intensely. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next, and the feeling of suspense is heightened by Mers's initial confidence and subsequent vulnerability."
