"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Mers has already tried to escape once and was caught, and now he is securely tied up with piano wire and guarded by a large and intimidating man, Crushak, who has orders to shoot him if he even tries to speak.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with a sudden distraction, a brief escape attempt, and a dramatic capture. The description of Crushak and the painful binding of Mers with piano wire adds to the sense of danger and suspense. The threat of being shot if Mers even tries to speak adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes."
