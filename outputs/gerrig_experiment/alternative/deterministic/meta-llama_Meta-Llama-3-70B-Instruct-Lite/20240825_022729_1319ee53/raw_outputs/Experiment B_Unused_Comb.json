"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Mers as feeling \"puny and impotent\" and being trapped by Chifrex and his gunmen, which suggests that his chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage starts with a sense of normalcy (Mers getting ready for dinner), but quickly takes a dramatic turn with the sudden arrival of Chifrex and his gunmen. The action is fast-paced and intense, with Mers trying to defend himself but ultimately being overpowered. The ending, with Mers feeling trapped and helpless, adds to the sense of suspense and tension."
