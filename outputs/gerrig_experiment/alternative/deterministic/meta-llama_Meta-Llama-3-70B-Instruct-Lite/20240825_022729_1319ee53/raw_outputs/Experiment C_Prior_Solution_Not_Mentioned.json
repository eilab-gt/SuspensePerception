"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers is currently tied up and at the mercy of Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak, with no obvious means of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Mers trying to escape and being thwarted, and the threat of violence from Crushak and Kalweitz. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"large and very ugly man\" and the \"painfully\" twisting wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense."
