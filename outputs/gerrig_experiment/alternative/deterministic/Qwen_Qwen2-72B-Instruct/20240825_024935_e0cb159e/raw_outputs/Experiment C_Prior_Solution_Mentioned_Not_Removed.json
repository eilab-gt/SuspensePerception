"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Mers escaping from Kalweitz. Mers has shown resourcefulness in the past, as evidenced by his ability to outwit Kalweitz's guard, but he is now tied up with piano wire and being guarded by Crushak, who seems to be a formidable opponent. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes involved and the unpredictable nature of the situation. Mers is in immediate danger, and the reader is left wondering whether he will be able to escape or if Kalweitz and Crushak will succeed in their plans. The tension is heightened by the use of descriptive language and the unexpected events that occur, such as the bird crashing into the window and the gun going off."
