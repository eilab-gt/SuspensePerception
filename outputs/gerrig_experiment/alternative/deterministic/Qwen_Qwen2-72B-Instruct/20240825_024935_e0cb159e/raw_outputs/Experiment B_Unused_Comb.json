"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Mers escaping from Chifrex. Mers is described as being trapped and disarmed, which suggests that his chances of escape are not high. However, Mers is also described as being agile and capable of executing impressive physical maneuvers, which could potentially aid him in an escape attempt. Without further information, it is impossible to determine the likelihood of Mers escaping.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, which creates a sense of suspense. Mers is caught off guard by Chifrex and his men, and is disarmed and trapped. The description of Mers's physical prowess and the potential for an escape attempt adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering whether Mers will be able to escape or not. The passage also ends on a cliffhanger, with Mers feeling \"puny and impotent,\" which leaves the reader eager to find out what happens next"
