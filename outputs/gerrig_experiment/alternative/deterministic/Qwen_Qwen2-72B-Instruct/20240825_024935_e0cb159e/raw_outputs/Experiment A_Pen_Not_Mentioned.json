"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Mers escaping from Chifrex. Mers has shown some agility and resourcefulness in his actions, but he is currently disarmed and outnumbered by Chifrex and his two gunmen. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes and the immediate danger that Mers and Vesper are in. Mers's sudden decision to act and his subsequent capture by Chifrex and his gunmen create a tense and uncertain situation, which is further heightened by the fact that Mers is disarmed and Chifrex seems to be in control."
