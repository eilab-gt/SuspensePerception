"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1)***\n\nMers's escape from Chifrex is not very likely at this point. Mers is caught off guard and his attempt to follow Vesper is quickly foiled by Chifrex's agility and quick thinking. Chifrex's skill in disarming Mers and his calm demeanor indicate that Mers is not in a position to easily escape.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Somewhat suspenseful\" (4)***\n\nThe passage is somewhat suspenseful because it describes a tense situation where Mers is trying to outmaneuver Chifrex and rescue Vesper. The description of the action, the sudden twist with the shoe, and the anticipation of Mers's plan create a sense of urgency and danger. However, it's not extremely suspenseful as the outcome is not yet determined and Mers's chances of escape are uncertain."
