"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBased on the passage, Mers is trapped and Chifrex and his gunmen are searching him, which indicates that it is unlikely Mers will be able to escape without being caught. Chifrex's presence and the fact that Mers has just been defeated and is disarmed suggest that Mers's confidence from before is not enough to overcome the situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events where Mers, who was confident, is ambushed by Chifrex and his men. The close-quarters combat, the twist with the shoe, and Mers's quick thinking are all elements that create tension and keep the reader engaged. The fact that Mers is now at the mercy of Chifrex adds to the suspense, as it raises the question of what will happen next and if he can find a way to escape or outsmart his captor."
