"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1)***\n\nMers's escape from Chifrex is not very likely at this point. Mers is described as being taken to his feet by the gunmen and having his revolver removed, with Chifrex observing his assistant's work attentively. Chifrex's comment about not wasting time suggests that he is prepared and has a plan, making it unlikely Mers can simply overpower the two gunmen and escape.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Somewhat suspenseful\" (4)***\n\nThe passage is somewhat suspenseful because it describes a tense situation where Mers tries to escape from Chifrex, using a quick and agile move to avoid being caught. The description of Chifrex's actions, such as his quick reflexes and ability to read Mers's thoughts, adds a level of intrigue and unpredictability to the scene. However, the outcome is not yet clear, so it's not extremely suspenseful yet."
