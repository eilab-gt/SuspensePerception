"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1)***\n\nMers's escape from Chifrex seems unlikely at this point. He is described as being taken down by Chifrex, who quickly and skillfully disarms him, and the Corsican is watching attentively. Mers's attempt to follow Vesper and cause damage to the gunmen is a last-ditch effort, but it doesn't seem to be a successful plan.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Somewhat suspenseful\" (4)***\n\nThe passage is somewhat suspenseful because it sets up a tense situation with Mers trying to escape and Chifrex's quick thinking and ability to catch him. The description of the action and the characters' reactions create a sense of urgency and anticipation for what might happen next. However, it's not extremely suspenseful, as the outcome is already foreshadowed by Mers's failure to initially escape."
