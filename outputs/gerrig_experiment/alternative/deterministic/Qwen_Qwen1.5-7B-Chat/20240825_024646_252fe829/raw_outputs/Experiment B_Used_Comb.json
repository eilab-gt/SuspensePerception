"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBased on the passage, Mers is trapped and Chifrex and his gunmen are searching him, which indicates that it is unlikely Mers will be able to escape without being caught. Chifrex's presence and the fact that Mers has just been defeated and is disarmed further suggests that Mers's chances of escaping are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events where Mers, who seems to be in control, is suddenly ambushed by Chifrex and his men. The close-quarters combat, the twist with the comb, and Mers's realization of his vulnerability all create a sense of tension and danger. The uncertainty of Mers's fate and the possibility of a confrontation with Chifrex adds to the suspense."
