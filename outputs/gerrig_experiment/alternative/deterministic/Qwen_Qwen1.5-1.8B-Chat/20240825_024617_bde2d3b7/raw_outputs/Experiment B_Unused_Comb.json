"5. Moderately likely\n\nThe passage describes Mers' victory over Chifrex, his successful escape from the situation, and his subsequent invitation to Vesper for dinner. However, the passage also includes a tense and suspenseful moment when Mers is caught by Chifrex and his two gunmen. Mers is unharmed, but he is trapped and the two gunmen search him carefully. The fact that Mers is unharmed and able to right himself with minimal damage suggests that he has some level of physical strength and agility, which could make him a formidable opponent in a fight. However, the fact that he is trapped and the fact that he is being searched by the two gunmen adds to the suspense and uncertainty of the situation. Therefore, it is likely that Mers is moderately likely to escape from Chifrex and his two gunmen, but the exact probability is not given in the passage."
