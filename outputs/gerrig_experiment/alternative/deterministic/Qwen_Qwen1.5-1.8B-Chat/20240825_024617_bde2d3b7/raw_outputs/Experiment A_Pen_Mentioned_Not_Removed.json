Extremely likely\n\nThe passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene where Charles Mers, a criminal figure, is attempting to rescue Vesper, a lady interest, from Chifrex, a two-man gang. Mers is aware of Chifrex's trap and decides to use his agility and quick thinking to escape. He successfully throws himself down the passage, causing Chifrex to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. Mers then uses his fountain pen to retrieve a weapon from Mers's shoulder holster, twists it sharply, and shoots out his left hand, catching Mers's shoe at the top of its arc. As he crashes to the ground, Mers rolls agilely and moves his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, righting himself with minimal damage.\n\nChifrex, who is standing in the doorway of a room on the right, is watching Mers's actions with a silent, spidery summons. Vesper, being led down a passage towards the back of the house, is being held captive by the two gunmen."
