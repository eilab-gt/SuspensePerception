Mers is determined to take down Chifrex and escape, and he uses a clever plan to do so. He throws himself down the passage after Vesper, causing a painful whistle from the thin man, and then twists his shoe to shoot out his left hand. Mers then moves his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, righting himself with minimal damage. The two gunmen are also involved in the pursuit, and Mers is caught in a dangerous situation. The passage builds tension as Mers tries to outsmart his pursuers and escape, with the reader wondering if he will succeed or if he will be caught and killed. The suspenseful nature of the passage is heightened by the unexpected twists and turns, as well as the high stakes involved in the situation."
