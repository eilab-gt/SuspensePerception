"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nMers's plan to \"do as much damage as possible\" to the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper was quickly foiled by the Corsican's swift and precise action. Mers was caught and disarmed, and Chifrex seems to be in control of the situation. This suggests that Mers's chances of escape are low.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, including Mers's sudden decision to act, the Corsican's lightning-fast reaction, and the quick and brutal disarming of Mers. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"crashed to the ground\", and \"gun trained on Mers's unquiet chest\" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful."
