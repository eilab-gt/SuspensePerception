"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is in a precarious situation, with two guns pointed at him and a large and intimidating man, Crushak, holding him in place. The fact that Kalweitz has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Mers if he tries to speak to him also implies that escape is unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Mers is in a desperate situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the image of the large bird crashing into the wall, and the menacing tone of Kalweitz and Crushak, also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere."
