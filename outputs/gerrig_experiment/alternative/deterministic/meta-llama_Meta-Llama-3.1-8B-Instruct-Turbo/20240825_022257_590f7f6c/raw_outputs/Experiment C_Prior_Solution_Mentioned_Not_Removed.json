"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is in a precarious situation, with two guns pointed at him and being restrained by piano wire. The fact that Kalweitz has a new, more formidable guard in Crushak, who is described as \"very large and very ugly\", also makes it seem unlikely that Mers will escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, Mers. The sudden interruption by the bird, the unexpected twist of events, and the introduction of a new, menacing character in Crushak all contribute to a sense of suspense. The passage also implies that Mers is in grave danger, which adds to the tension and makes the reader wonder what will happen next."
