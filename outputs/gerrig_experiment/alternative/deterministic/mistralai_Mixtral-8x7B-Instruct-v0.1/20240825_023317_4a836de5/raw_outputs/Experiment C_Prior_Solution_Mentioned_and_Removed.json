" ***Answer to Question 1:***\n1. Not very likely\n\n**Justification:** Mers is currently a prisoner of Kalweitz and his gunmen, and they have taken measures to ensure he can't escape easily. Mers may be clever and resourceful, but the situation looks dire.\n\n***Answer to Question 2:***\n5. Moderately suspenseful\n\n**Justification:** While the passage does build tension and suspense as Mers is captured and bound, it doesn't quite reach the level of very or extremely suspenseful. The stakes are high, but the outcome is still uncertain."
