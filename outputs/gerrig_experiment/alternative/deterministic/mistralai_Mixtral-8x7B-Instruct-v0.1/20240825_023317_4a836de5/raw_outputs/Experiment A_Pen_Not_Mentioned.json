" ***Answer 1:*** 1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Mers is currently surrounded by Chifrex and his two gunmen, all of whom appear to be competent and prepared for violence. Mers has already attempted to escape once and was quickly overpowered, which does not bode well for his chances of successfully escaping in the future.\n\n***Answer 2:*** 5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Mers attempts to escape and is quickly captured. However, the outcome of the situation is not completely uncertain, as it seems unlikely that Mers will be able to escape given the circumstances. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as moderately high."
