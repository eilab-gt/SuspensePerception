"  Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\n\nBased on the passage, it is not very likely that Mers will escape from Kalweitz. Kalweitz and his gunmen have him tied up and under guard, and they seem to be taking no chances. The passage mentions that Crushak has been instructed to shoot Mers if he tries to speak to him, which suggests that Kalweitz is determined to keep Mers captive. Therefore, the answer is (1) Not very likely.\n\nQuestion 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\n\nI find this passage to be quite suspenseful. The unexpected arrival of the bird, followed by Mers's attempt to escape and the gunmen's intervention, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The passage also builds on the danger and menace of the situation by describing Crushak as \"very large and very ugly,\" which adds to the overall sense of unease. Therefore, the answer is (6) Very suspenseful."
