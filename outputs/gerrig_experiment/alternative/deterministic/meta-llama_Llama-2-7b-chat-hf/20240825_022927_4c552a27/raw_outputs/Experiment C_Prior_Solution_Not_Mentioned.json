"  Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\n\nBased on the passage, it is not very likely that Mers will escape from Kalweitz and his gunmen. Mers has been tied up and pinned in a chair by Crushak, and Kalweitz has made it clear that he does not intend to let Mers go. The passage states that Kalweitz is \"not amused by [Mers'] antics\" and that he will leave Mers with Crushak to \"contemplate [Mers'] rude behavior.\" This suggests that Kalweitz has no intention of letting Mers escape. Therefore, the answer is (1) Not very likely.\n\nQuestion 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\n\nI find this passage to be quite suspenseful. The sudden appearance of the bird crashing into the wall of glass, followed by Mers's attempt to escape and the arrival of the large and ugly man, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The passage also builds on the suspense by describing the painful way in which Mers is tied up and pinned"
