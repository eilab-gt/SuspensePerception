"  Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\n\nBased on the passage, it is not very likely that Mers will escape from Kalweitz. Kalweitz and his gunmen have him tied up and pinned in a chair, and they seem to be taking great care to ensure that he cannot escape. The use of piano wire to restrain Mers suggests that they are determined to keep him captive. Therefore, the answer is (1) Not very likely.\n\nQuestion 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\n\nI find this passage to be quite suspenseful. The unexpected arrival of the bird, followed by Mers's attempt to escape and the gunmen's intervention, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The use of dark and light to create a sense of confusion and danger also adds to the suspense. Additionally, the mention of the gunmen's ugliness and their intention to eliminate Mers adds to the sense of danger and menace. Therefore, the answer is (6) Very suspenseful."
