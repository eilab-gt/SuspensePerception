" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Mers's escape. Although Mers has shown some resourcefulness in creating a distraction, he is now bound to a chair by piano wire, and the situation seems dire. However, without further context or information about Mers's abilities or potential allies, it is difficult to make a definitive prediction.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes a dangerous situation in which Mers is captured and bound by Kalweitz and his henchman, Crushak. The tension is heightened by the use of descriptive language, such as the mention of the gun pointed at Mers's chest and the painful twisting of the piano wire around his arms. The uncertainty of Mers's fate adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering if and how he will escape from this perilous situation"
