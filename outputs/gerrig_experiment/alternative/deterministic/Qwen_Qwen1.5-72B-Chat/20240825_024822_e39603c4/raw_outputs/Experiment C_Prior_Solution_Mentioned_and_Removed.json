"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n2. Somewhat likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nIn the passage, Mers initially attempts to use the distraction caused by the bird to his advantage, but he is quickly apprehended by Kalweitz's henchman, Crushak. Despite his resourcefulness, Mers is now tied up with piano wire, which suggests a higher level of security and pain, making his escape more challenging but not impossible. The situation is quite suspenseful as Kalweitz threatens Mers and emphasizes the severity of the consequences if he tries to outsmart them again, with Crushak being a more formidable opponent than the previous guard."
