"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\n2. Somewhat likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nIn the passage, Mers attempts to use the distraction caused by the bird to create an opportunity for escape, but he is quickly apprehended by Kalweitz's associate, Crushak. The description of the tense situation, the use of piano wire to restrain Mers, and Kalweitz's mention of Mers's previous escape and the fate of the previous guard all contribute to a high level of suspense. However, Mers's ability to escape is somewhat likely given his resourcefulness in the past, but it's not guaranteed given the current circumstances and the presence of the formidable Crushak."
