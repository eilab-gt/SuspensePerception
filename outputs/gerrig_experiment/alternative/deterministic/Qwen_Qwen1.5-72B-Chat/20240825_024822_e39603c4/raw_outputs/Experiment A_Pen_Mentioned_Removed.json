Somewhat likely\n\nMers demonstrates resourcefulness and quick thinking by attempting to attack the gunmen and communicate with Vesper. However, his attempt is foiled by the Corsican's agility, and he is subsequently disarmed and searched. While he is not in an ideal situation, his actions show that he is not passive and is willing to take risks, which increases the likelihood of an escape attempt.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension and fast-paced action as Mers makes a daring move to free himself and Vesper. The\u63cf\u5199 of the Corsican's quick response and Chifrex's anticipation of Mers's thoughts adds to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering if Mers will find another opportunity to escape or if he has been completely outmaneuvered.
