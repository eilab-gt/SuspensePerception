"Here are my assessments based on the passage:\n\n**Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?**\n\n**Answer: 1. Not very likely**\n\n**Reasoning:**  The passage clearly establishes that Kalweitz is prepared for Mers's tricks. He has a more ruthless and dedicated enforcer in Crushak, and Mers is now physically restrained.  \n\n**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**\n\n**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**\n\n**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. \n\n* Mers's initial attempt at escape is thwarted.\n* The introduction of Crushak and the description of his menacing appearance heighten the danger.\n* The threat to Mers's life and the reference to the previous guard's death create a sense of urgency and foreboding. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to analyze any other aspects of the passage! \n"
