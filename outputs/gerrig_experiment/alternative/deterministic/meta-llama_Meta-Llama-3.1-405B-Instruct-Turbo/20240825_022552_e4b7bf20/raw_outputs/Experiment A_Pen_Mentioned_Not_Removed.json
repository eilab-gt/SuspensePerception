"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 5: Moderately likely. Mers has already shown his resourcefulness and agility in his attempt to escape and his quick thinking in hiding his fountain pen. However, he is still outnumbered and outgunned, and Chifrex seems to be in control of the situation. While Mers's chances of escape are not impossible, they are not extremely likely either.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action, tension, and uncertainty, with Mers's sudden decision to escape, the swift and violent response of the Corsican, and the ominous presence of Chifrex. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"crashed to the ground\", and \"gun trained on Mers's unquiet chest\" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful."
