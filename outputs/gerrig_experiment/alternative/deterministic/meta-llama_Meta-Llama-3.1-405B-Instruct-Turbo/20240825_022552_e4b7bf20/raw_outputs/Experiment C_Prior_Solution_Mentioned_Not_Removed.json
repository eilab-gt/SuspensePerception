"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would rate this as a 2. Somewhat likely. While Mers has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in attempting to escape, he is now tied up with piano wire and being guarded by the formidable and intimidating Mr. Crushak. However, Mers has a history of outwitting his captors, as mentioned by Kalweitz, so it's possible he may find a way to escape again.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Mers facing a dire situation and a menacing villain in Kalweitz. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the bird crashing into the glass and the feeling of the piano wire biting into Mers's flesh, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The introduction of the intimidating Mr. Crushak and Kalweitz's sinister intentions also raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, making the passage very suspenseful."
