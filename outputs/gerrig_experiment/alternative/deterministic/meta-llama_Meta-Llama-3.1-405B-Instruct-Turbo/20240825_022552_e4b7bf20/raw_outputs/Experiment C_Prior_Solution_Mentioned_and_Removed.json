"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would rate this as a 2. Somewhat likely. While Mers has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in attempting to escape, he is now tied up with piano wire and being guarded by a large and ugly man with a gun. However, Mers has a history of outwitting his captors, as mentioned by Kalweitz, so it's possible he may find a way to escape again.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Mers's failed escape attempt, the introduction of the intimidating and ugly Mr. Crushak, and the use of piano wire to restrain Mers. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot Mers if he even attempts to speak to him adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes, making the situation feel very suspenseful."
