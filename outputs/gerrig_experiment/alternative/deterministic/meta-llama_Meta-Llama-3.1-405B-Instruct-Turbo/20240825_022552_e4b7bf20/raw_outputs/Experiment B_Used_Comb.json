"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has already been overpowered and disarmed by Chifrex and his men, and is now being held captive. While Mers showed some agility and quick thinking in his initial attempt to defend himself, he is now in a vulnerable position and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without some external help or a clever plan.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of sudden and intense danger, with Mers being ambushed and overpowered by Chifrex and his men. The use of vivid language, such as \"the door burst in toward him\" and \"Mers crashed to the ground\", adds to the sense of tension and urgency. The fact that Mers is now a captive and at the mercy of his enemies creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about what will happen next, making the passage very suspenseful."
