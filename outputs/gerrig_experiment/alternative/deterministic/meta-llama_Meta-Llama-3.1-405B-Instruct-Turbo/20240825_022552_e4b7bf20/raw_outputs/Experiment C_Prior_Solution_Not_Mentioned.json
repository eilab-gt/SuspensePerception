"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?\"***\nI would rate this as a 2. Somewhat likely. While Mers has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in attempting to escape, he is now tied up with piano wire and being guarded by the formidable Mr. Crushak. However, Mers's previous escape attempt and his overall character suggest that he may still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Mers's failed escape attempt and subsequent capture by Kalweitz and his henchman. The use of vivid language, such as the description of Crushak's ugliness and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and unease. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Mers next and how he will manage to escape from his predicament."
