"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Mers has already been overpowered and disarmed by Chifrex's men, and Chifrex seems to be in control of the situation. While Mers showed some agility and quick thinking in his initial attempt to defend himself, he is now trapped and at the mercy of his captors.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of sudden and intense danger, with Mers being ambushed and overpowered by Chifrex's men. The use of vivid language, such as \"the door burst in toward him\" and \"Mers crashed to the ground\", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The fact that Mers is now trapped and at the mercy of his enemies creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about what will happen next, making the passage very suspenseful."
