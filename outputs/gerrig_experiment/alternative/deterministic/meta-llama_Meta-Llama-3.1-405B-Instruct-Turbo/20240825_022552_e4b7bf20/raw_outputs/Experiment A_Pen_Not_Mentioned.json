"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Mers will escape from Chifrex?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. While Mers has shown agility and quick thinking in his attempt to escape, he is currently outnumbered and outgunned. Chifrex and his men seem to be in control of the situation, and Mers's initial escape attempt was thwarted. However, Mers's resourcefulness and pride in his physical abilities suggest that he may still find a way to escape or turn the tables.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action, tension, and uncertainty, with Mers's sudden decision to escape, the swift and violent response from the Corsican, and the ominous presence of Chifrex. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"crashed to the ground\", and \"gun trained on Mers's unquiet chest\" creates a sense of urgency and danger, keeping the reader on edge and wondering what will happen next."
