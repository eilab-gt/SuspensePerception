"  Based on the passage, here are my answers to the two questions:\n\n**Question 1: How likely is it that Mers will escape from Kalweitz?**\n\nI would rate the likelihood of Mers escaping from Kalweitz as \"Not very likely\". The passage states that Crushak is \"devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life\", and that he has orders to shoot Mers if he even attempts to speak to him. Additionally, Mers is currently bound and helpless in a wooden armchair, making escape difficult.\n\n**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**\n\nI would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as \"Very suspenseful\". The passage is full of tension and danger, with Mers being held captive by Kalweitz and his henchman Crushak. The threat of violence and death looms over Mers, making the situation very suspenseful. Additionally, the passage sets up the possibility of Mers trying to escape or outwit his captors, which adds to the suspense."
