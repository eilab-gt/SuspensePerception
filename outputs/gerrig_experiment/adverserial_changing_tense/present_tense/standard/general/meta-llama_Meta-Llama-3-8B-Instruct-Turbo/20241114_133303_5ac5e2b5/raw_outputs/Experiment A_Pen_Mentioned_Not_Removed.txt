Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned, and he has already been caught off guard by Le Chiffre's trap. While Bond is resourceful and agile, the odds are against him, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the author's use of vivid descriptions and quick pacing helps to build a sense of urgency. The sudden twists and turns, such as the Corsican's quick shot at Bond's shoe, add to the suspense and make the reader feel like anything could happen at any moment. The passage also raises questions about what will happen next, such as whether Bond will be able to escape or what Le Chiffre has planned for him, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
