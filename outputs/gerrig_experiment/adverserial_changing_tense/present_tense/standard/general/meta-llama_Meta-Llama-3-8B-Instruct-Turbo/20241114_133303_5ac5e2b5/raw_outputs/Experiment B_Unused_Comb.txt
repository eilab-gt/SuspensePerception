Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is trapped and disarmed, and he is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and surprise, with unexpected events unfolding quickly. The sudden appearance of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the physical confrontation between Bond and the gunmen, and the feeling of impotence and vulnerability that Bond experiences all contribute to a sense of high suspense.
