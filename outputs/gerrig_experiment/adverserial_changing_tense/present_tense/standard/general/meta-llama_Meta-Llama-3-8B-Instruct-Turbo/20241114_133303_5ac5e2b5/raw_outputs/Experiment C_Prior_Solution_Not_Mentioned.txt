Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The situation seems dire for Bond, as he is trapped in Blofeld's office with no clear escape route and is being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The fact that Bond is being tied up with piano wire and is at the mercy of his captors makes it unlikely that he will escape easily.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkening of the room, and the appearance of Crushak all contribute to a sense of uncertainty and danger. The physical and emotional vulnerability of Bond, as well as the menacing tone of Blofeld and Crushak, make the reader feel like anything could happen at any moment. The passage expertly builds suspense by creating a sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness, making the reader feel like Bond is in a desperate situation with no clear way out.
