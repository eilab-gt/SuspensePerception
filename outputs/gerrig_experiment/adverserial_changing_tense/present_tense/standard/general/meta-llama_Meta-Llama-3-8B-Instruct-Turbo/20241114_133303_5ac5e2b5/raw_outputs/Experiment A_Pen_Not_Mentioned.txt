Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. This does not look like a promising situation for Bond's escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a critical moment in the story where Bond's fate is uncertain. He's been caught off guard and is now at the mercy of his captors. The quick and intense action, combined with the ominous tone and the sense of danger, creates a sense of tension and suspense that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
