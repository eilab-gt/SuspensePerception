Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches, given that he is now a prisoner, tied up and guarded by two heavily armed men. Bond's attempts to escape have been foiled so far, and it seems that Blofeld has taken extensive measures to ensure his capture.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the descriptions of the setting and the characters' actions create a sense of urgency and fear. The use of vivid language, such as "large and very ugly man" and "painfully into Bond's flesh", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
