***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently trapped and tied up, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The fact that Bond is tied up and at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
