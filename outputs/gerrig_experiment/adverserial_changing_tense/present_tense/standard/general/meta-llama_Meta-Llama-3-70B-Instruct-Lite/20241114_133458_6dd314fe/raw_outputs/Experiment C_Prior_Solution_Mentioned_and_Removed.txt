***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond has been captured and tied up, the passage suggests that he has already shown his ability to think on his feet and take advantage of distractions. The fact that he was able to cause Blofeld to stumble and knock out the light gives hope that he might be able to find another opportunity to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up, and Crushak threatening to shoot him if he even speaks. The description of Crushak as "very large and very ugly" adds to the sense of menace, and the detail about the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh creates a vivid and uncomfortable image. The passage effectively conveys a sense of urgency and raises questions about how Bond will manage to escape.
