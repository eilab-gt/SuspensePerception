I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional text provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but it's unclear how he will escape or if he will escape at all.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension by putting Bond and Vesper in a dangerous situation, making the reader wonder what will happen to them next.
