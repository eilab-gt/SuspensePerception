***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's clutches before, the current situation seems quite dire, with Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. However, Bond's history of escaping from tight spots leaves some room for doubt about his ability to escape again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the bird crashing into the wall and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape, if at all.
