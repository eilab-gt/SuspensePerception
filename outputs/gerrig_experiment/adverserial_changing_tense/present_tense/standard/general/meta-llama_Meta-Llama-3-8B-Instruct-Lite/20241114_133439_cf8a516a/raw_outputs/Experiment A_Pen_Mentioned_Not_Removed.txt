Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it seems unlikely that he will escape from their clutches. He is being disarmed, and Le Chiffre is taking control of the situation, which suggests that Bond's chances of escape are low.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of the events unfolding creates a sense of urgency and unease. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashes to the ground", and "trained on Bond's unquiet chest" adds to the sense of tension and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
