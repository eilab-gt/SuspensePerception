Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, with no clear escape route or plan in sight. He's being restrained by piano wire and Crushak is being told to take care of him, implying that he's in a very difficult and precarious situation. It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from this situation, at least not without some kind of dramatic turn of events.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it's clear that Bond is in a dire situation and is at the mercy of his captors. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of foreboding. The fact that Bond is being restrained and is at the mercy of his captors, with no clear escape route, creates a sense of tension and suspense. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond is also tense and ominous, with Blofeld making it clear that he's not going to go easy on Bond this time. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
