Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped and disarmed, and it seems unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen without some kind of dramatic turn of events.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being searched by the gunmen, and Le Chiffre is gloating over his victory. The use of words like "pats him down", "twists him around", and "feels puny and impotent" creates a sense of vulnerability and helplessness, making the reader feel on edge and worried for Bond's safety. The sudden and unexpected turn of events, such as Bond being overpowered and disarmed, also adds to the suspense.
