Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been overpowered by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and is now being searched and disarmed. This suggests that his chances of escape are low.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is trapped and being overpowered by his captors. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "twists it sharply", and "brusquely" creates a sense of tension and urgency, making the reader feel like they are experiencing the events alongside Bond. The sudden twists and turns in the passage, such as Bond's failed attempt to kick the thin man and the Corsican's quick thinking, add to the suspense and keep the reader engaged.
