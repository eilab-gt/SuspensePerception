Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being held in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and legs. This makes it unlikely that he will escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the use of words like "eliminating" and "irritations" creates a sense of menace and foreboding. The darkening of the room and the use of a gun also adds to the suspense. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
