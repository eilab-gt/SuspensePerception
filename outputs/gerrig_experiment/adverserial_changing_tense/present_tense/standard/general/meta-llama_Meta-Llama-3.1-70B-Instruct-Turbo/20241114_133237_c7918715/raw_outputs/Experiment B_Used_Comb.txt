***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Given the situation, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is low. Bond has been caught off guard, disarmed, and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men. Although Bond showed some agility and quick thinking in his initial reaction, he was ultimately subdued and is now at Le Chiffre's mercy. Therefore, my answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I find this passage to be extremely suspenseful. The sudden and unexpected turn of events, with Le Chiffre and his men bursting into Bond's hotel room, creates a sense of shock and tension. The description of the ensuing struggle and Bond's subsequent capture and disarming adds to the suspense, as it leaves the reader wondering what will happen to Bond next. The fact that Bond feels "puny and impotent" at the end of the passage also adds to the sense of foreboding and raises the stakes, making the reader eager to find out what will happen next. Therefore, my answer is:

7. Extremely suspenseful
