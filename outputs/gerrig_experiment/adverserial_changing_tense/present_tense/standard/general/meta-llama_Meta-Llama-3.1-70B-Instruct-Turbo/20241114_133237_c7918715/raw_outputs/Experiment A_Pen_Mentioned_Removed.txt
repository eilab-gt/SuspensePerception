***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Given the passage, I would say the likelihood of Bond escaping is 2. Somewhat likely. Although Bond has been caught and disarmed, he has already shown his resourcefulness and quick thinking by attempting to rescue Vesper and moving his fountain pen (which might be a hidden tool) into a safer position. However, the odds are still against him, as he is outnumbered and outgunned.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 6. Very suspenseful. The scene is intense and action-packed, with Bond trying to rescue Vesper and then being caught and disarmed. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, and the fact that Le Chiffre has discovered Bond's hidden fountain pen adds to the tension. The passage effectively creates a sense of urgency and danger, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.
