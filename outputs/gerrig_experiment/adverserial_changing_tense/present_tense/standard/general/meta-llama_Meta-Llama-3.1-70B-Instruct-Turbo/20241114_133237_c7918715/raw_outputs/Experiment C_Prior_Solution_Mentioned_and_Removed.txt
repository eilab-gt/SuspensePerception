***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because Bond has already managed to escape from Blofeld once before, and he has shown resourcefulness in the face of danger, as seen in the passage when he takes advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall. Additionally, Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent, which increases his chances of finding a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive by Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of physical restraints, such as the piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and vulnerability. The threat of being shot if Bond attempts to speak to Crushak also raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The passage effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged, wondering how Bond will manage to escape from his predicament.
