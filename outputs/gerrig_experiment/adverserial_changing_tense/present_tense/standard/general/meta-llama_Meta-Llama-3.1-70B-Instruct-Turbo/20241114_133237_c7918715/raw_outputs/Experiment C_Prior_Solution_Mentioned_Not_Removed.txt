***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would answer: 6. Very likely.

Although Bond is currently being held captive and tied up with piano wire, the fact that he was able to outwit Blofeld's guard in the past and that he managed to create a distraction earlier in the scene suggests that he is resourceful and might find a way to escape again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful.

The passage is filled with tension and suspense, as Bond is being held captive and threatened by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of a sudden distraction (the bird crashing into the wall) creates a sense of urgency and chaos, and the subsequent events (Bond's attempt to escape and his capture) keep the reader on edge. The fact that Bond is being tied up with piano wire and is at the mercy of his captors adds to the sense of danger and suspense.
