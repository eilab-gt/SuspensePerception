***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given the additional information, I would rate it as 6. Very likely. This is because Bond has already demonstrated his ability to think on his feet and take advantage of distractions, as seen when the bird crashes into the wall of glass. Although he was ultimately caught by Crushak, Bond's resourcefulness and quick thinking suggest that he may be able to find another opportunity to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate it as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is filled with tense moments, from the bird crashing into the wall of glass to Bond's narrow escape attempt, and finally, to his being tied up by Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak, with no clear escape route, heightens the sense of danger and uncertainty, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
