**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond's attempts to escape are thwarted by the presence of a large and formidable guard, Crushak, who is devoted to eliminating Bond. Additionally, Bond is physically restrained by piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to move or escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
Based on the passage, I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is captured and restrained by Blofeld and his guard. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, and the graphic details of Bond's physical restraint, adds to the suspense. The passage also implies that Bond is in grave danger, as he was able to outwit his captors in the past but is now facing a more formidable opponent.
