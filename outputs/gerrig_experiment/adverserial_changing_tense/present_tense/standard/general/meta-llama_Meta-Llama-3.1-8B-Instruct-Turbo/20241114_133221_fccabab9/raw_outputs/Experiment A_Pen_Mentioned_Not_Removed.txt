**Answer to Question 1:**
Given the situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Not very likely" (1). Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. Although Bond is resourceful and agile, the odds are against him at this point. He has been caught off guard and has suffered some damage, which may limit his ability to escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as "Very suspenseful" (6). The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency as Bond is caught off guard and struggles to escape. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "like lightning" and "very quickly, but somehow delicately", adds to the sense of speed and danger. The fact that Bond is disarmed and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men also adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape.
