Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Bond trying to escape and doing some damage, but ultimately being caught and disarmed. It's unclear whether he will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches, and the situation seems precarious.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond trying to escape and being caught, and the sense of danger and uncertainty is palpable. The use of vivid language, such as "whistle of pain", "like lightning", and "unquiet chest", adds to the sense of urgency and suspense.
