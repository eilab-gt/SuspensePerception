***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

Although Bond has shown his ability to escape from difficult situations in the past, the current situation seems quite dire. He is tied up with piano wire, and Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, has been instructed to shoot him if he even attempts to speak. On the other hand, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's possible that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense from the start, with Bond being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The sudden distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall adds to the suspense, and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape is thwarted by Crushak. The description of Crushak's ugly appearance and Bond's painful predicament adds to the sense of danger and suspense. The passage effectively builds tension and leaves the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this difficult situation.
