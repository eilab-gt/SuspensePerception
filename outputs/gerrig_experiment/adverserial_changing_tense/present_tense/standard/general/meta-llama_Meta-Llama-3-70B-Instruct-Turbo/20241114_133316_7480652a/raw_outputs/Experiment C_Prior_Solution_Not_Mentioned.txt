***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up by Blofeld's henchman, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his cunning and ability to escape from tight spots. It's likely that Bond will find a way to escape, possibly using his surroundings to his advantage or exploiting a weakness in his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is quite suspenseful, as Bond is in a dangerous situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The addition of the large and ugly henchman, Mr. Crushak, adds to the tension, and the use of piano wire to tie Bond up creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader engaged, eager to find out what will happen next.
