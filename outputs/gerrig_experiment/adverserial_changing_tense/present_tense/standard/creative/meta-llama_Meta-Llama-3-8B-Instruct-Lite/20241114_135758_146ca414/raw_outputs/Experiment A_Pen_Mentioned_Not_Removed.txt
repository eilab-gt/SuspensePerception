Answer 1: I would choose 1. Not very likely. It seems that Bond has been caught off guard by Le Chiffre's trap and is now being overpowered by the two gunmen. He's been caught and disarmed, which doesn't bode well for his chances of escape.

Answer 2: I would choose 6. Very suspenseful. This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's clear that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches. The use of descriptive language, such as "whistle of pain" and "agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed", adds to the tension and suspense. The reader is on the edge of their seat, eager to know what happens next.
