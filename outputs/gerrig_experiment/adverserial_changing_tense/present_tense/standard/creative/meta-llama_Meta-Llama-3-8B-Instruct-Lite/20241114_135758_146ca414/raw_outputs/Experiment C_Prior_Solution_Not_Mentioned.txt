Answer 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?
I would choose 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and it seems that Bond is being physically restrained by piano wire. This makes it difficult for Bond to escape, especially given the presence of a large and formidable henchman.

Answer 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?
I would choose 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive, being physically restrained, and facing a brutal and unpleasant henchman. The use of words like "painfully" to describe the wire biting into Bond's flesh, and the ominous tone of Blofeld's words, all contribute to a sense of high suspense. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape, and if so, how he will manage to do so.
