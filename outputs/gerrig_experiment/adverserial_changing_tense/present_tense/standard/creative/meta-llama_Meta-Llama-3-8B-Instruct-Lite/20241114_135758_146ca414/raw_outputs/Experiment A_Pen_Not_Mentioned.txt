Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has just been caught and is being held by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, with Le Chiffre himself keeping a close eye on the situation. He has been overpowered and disarmed, making it unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is highly suspenseful as it describes Bond's unexpected capture and the events that unfold as he is overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper as they are held captive, and the sense of danger and tension is palpable. The use of words like "silence", "whistle of pain", "sharply", and "brusquely" adds to the suspense and creates a sense of urgency and danger.
