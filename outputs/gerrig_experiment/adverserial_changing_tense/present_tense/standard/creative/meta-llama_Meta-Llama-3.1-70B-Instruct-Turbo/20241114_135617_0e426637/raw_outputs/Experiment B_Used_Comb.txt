Based on the passage, here are the answers:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain 

At this point in the passage, Bond has already been disarmed and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. However, Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick reflexes in trying to defend himself earlier, which leaves some hope for his potential escape. Given the context of a James Bond novel, it is also reasonable to assume that Bond will find a way to escape, but based on the immediate situation, it is uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful 

The passage is filled with action, tension, and a sense of danger. The sudden burst of the door, the guns drawn, and the physical confrontation between Bond and the gunmen create a high level of suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond is now trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, who is eager to take revenge, raises the stakes and makes the reader wonder what will happen next.
