Based on the passage provided, here are the answers to the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain.

While Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations, the passage presents a situation where he is being held captive by Blofeld and his men. The use of piano wire to restrain Bond makes it seem like he is in a precarious position. However, given Bond's track record, it's also possible that he might find a way to escape. The passage does not provide enough information to make a definitive prediction, hence a neutral answer.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful.

The passage is full of tense moments, starting with the bird crashing into the wall, Bond's attempt to escape, and the subsequent confrontation with Crushak. The description of Bond being tied up with piano wire and the pain it causes adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The ominous warning from Blofeld about Crushak's devotion to eliminating irritations from his life further heightens the sense of danger and unpredictability,
