***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This choice is based on the passage's depiction of Bond's resourcefulness, agility, and determination to escape and protect Vesper. Bond is able to think and act quickly, as seen in his attempt to fight back and his subtle movement of the fountain pen, suggesting he is still plotting his next move.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is filled with tense moments, such as Bond's sudden decision to fight back, the rapid exchange of actions between Bond and the Corsican, and the ominous presence of Le Chiffre and the two gunmen. The sense of urgency and danger is palpable, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
