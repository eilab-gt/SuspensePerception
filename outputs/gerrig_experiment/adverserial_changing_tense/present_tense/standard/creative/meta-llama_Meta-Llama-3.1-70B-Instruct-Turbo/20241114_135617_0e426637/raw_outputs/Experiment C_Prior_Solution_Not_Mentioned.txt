***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6. Very likely. 

James Bond is known for his cunning and resourcefulness. The passage itself already shows Bond attempting to take advantage of a distraction to escape. Although this attempt is thwarted, Bond's ability to think on his feet suggests that he will continue to look for opportunities to escape. Furthermore, Bond's character has escaped from numerous difficult situations in the past, which adds to the likelihood of his escape in this scenario.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6. Very suspenseful. 

The passage effectively builds tension by creating a series of challenges and obstacles for Bond to overcome. The sudden interruption of the bird crashing into the glass wall and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape create a sense of urgency and unpredictability. The introduction of the menacing character, Mr. Crushak, and the painful process of Bond being tied up with piano wire, further heighten the sense of danger and suspense. The passage effectively sets the stage for a dramatic and intense confrontation, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
