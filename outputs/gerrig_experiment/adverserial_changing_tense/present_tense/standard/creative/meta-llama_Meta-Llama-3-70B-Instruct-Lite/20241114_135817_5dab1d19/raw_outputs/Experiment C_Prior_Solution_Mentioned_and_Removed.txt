***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, we know that Bond is a resourceful and skilled spy agent who has managed to escape from difficult situations before. Additionally, the passage suggests that Bond has already outwitted Blofeld once before, which gives us hope that he might be able to do so again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the image of the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of danger and discomfort. The threat of Crushak shooting Bond if he even attempts to speak adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
