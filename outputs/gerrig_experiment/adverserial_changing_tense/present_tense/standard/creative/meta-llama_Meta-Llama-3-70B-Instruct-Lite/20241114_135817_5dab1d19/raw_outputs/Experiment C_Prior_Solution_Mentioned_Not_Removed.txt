***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, he has a history of escaping from difficult situations, and the passage doesn't provide any information that would suggest this time would be different.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the contortion of Crushak's face and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The fact that Bond has a history of escaping, but is currently in a vulnerable position, also adds to the suspense.
