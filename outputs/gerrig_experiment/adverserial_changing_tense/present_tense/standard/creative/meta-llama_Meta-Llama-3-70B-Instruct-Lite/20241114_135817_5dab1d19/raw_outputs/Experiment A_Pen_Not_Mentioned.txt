***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because, despite Bond being captured and at a disadvantage, the passage suggests that he is still able to think and act quickly, and is not one to give up easily. The fact that he is able to react agilely and minimize damage when thrown to the ground, and is described as having "unquiet" chest, implies that he is still a threat and may be planning his next move.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it is clear that Bond is in a dangerous and precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of words like "spidery" and "whistle of pain" create a sense of tension and foreboding, and the fact that Bond is being searched and disarmed adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The cliffhanger ending, with Le Chiffre's ominous phrase "Let's not waste time", only adds to the suspense.
