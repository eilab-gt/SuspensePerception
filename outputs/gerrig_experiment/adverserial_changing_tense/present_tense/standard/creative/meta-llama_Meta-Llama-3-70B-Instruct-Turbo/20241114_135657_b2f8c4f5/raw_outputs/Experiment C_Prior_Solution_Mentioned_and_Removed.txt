***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has already shown some resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction to try and escape, he has been caught again and is now securely tied up. On the other hand, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it is likely that he will find a way to escape eventually. The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease. The threat of Bond being shot if he even attempts to speak to Crushak also raises the stakes and creates suspense. Overall, the passage effectively builds tension and creates a sense of uncertainty, making it very suspenseful.
