***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's typical of the Bond series for him to escape from seemingly impossible situations. Although the passage describes Bond being trapped and tied up, it's likely that he will find a way to escape, possibly using his skills or exploiting a weakness in Blofeld's plan.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's attempts to escape and Blofeld's countermeasures. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large and very ugly" man, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes. The passage also leaves the reader wondering how Bond will escape from his predicament, which adds to the suspense.
