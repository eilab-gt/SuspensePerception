***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has shown agility and quick thinking in his attempt to rescue Vesper, he has been caught and disarmed by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The situation looks dire, but Bond's resourcefulness and cunning might still give him an opportunity to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and action, from Bond's sudden decision to rescue Vesper to his failed attempt and subsequent capture. The description of the Corsican's swift and delicate movements, Le Chiffre's attentive observation, and the stripping of Bond's weaponry creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, making the passage very suspenseful.
