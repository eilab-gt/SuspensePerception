***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

Although Bond has shown some resourcefulness and agility in trying to escape and attempting to hide his fountain pen, he is currently at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The situation seems dire, but it's hard to predict what might happen next, given Bond's skills and the unpredictability of the story.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond trying to escape and being caught by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of action words like "hurls", "slams", "whistles", and "twists" adds to the dynamic and intense atmosphere. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, which increases the suspense.
