Based on the passage provided earlier, I'll answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine Bond's chances of escape, and the situation seems precarious for Bond.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates tension by describing Bond's attempts to escape, only to be thwarted by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the contorted smile and the painful wire restraints, adds to the sense of danger and suspense.
