Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has shown some agility and quick thinking in defending himself against the gunmen, he is currently trapped and at Le Chiffre's mercy. It's unclear whether he will be able to escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being suddenly ambushed and overpowered by Le Chiffre's gunmen. The description of Bond's attempts to defend himself and the rough treatment he receives at the hands of his captors adds to the sense of suspense and raises questions about what will happen to Bond next.
