Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched for any remaining weapons. Le Chiffre has taken away Bond's revolver and fountain pen, leaving him largely disarmed. This makes it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without a plan or some form of external assistance.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Bond is being disarmed and searched. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, especially since Bond's attempts to escape and defend himself have been thwarted so far. The pace is fast-moving, and the descriptions of the action are vivid and intense, making it easy to become fully engaged in the story.
