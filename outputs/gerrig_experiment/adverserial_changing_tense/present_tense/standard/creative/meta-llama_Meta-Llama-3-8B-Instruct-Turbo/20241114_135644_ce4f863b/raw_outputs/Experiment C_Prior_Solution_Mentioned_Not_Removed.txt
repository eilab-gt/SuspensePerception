**Answer to Question 1:**

1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and is being securely tied up with piano wire. Additionally, Crushak seems to be a formidable and ruthless individual, and Bond is at a disadvantage.

**Answer to Question 2:**

6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful, as it is a tense and intense situation for Bond. The sudden introduction of the bird crashing into the glass, the darkening of the room, and the appearance of Crushak all create a sense of uncertainty and danger. The description of Crushak's physical appearance and his sinister intentions add to the suspense, as does Blofeld's menacing tone. The passage expertly builds tension and keeps the reader on edge, making it very suspenseful.
