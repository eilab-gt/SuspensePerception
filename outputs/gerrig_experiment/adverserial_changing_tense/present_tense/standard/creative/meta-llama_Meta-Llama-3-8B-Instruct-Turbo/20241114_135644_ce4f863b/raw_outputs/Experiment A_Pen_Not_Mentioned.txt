Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is already captured and disarmed, with Le Chiffre's gunmen holding him at gunpoint. Given the circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's custody without some kind of dramatic intervention.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, who are being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of phrases like "silent, spidery summons" and "crashes to the ground" creates a sense of danger and unpredictability, making the reader feel like anything could happen next. The suspense is heightened by the fact that Bond's plan to escape and exchange words with Vesper seems to have been foiled, leaving him in a precarious situation.
