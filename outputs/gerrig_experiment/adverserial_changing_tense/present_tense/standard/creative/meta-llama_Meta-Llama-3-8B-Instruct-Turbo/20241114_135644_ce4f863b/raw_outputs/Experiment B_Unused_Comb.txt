Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is caught off guard and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men. He is able to momentarily take down one of the gunmen, but is then quickly overpowered and disarmed. Given his circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches at this point.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger from the very beginning. The sudden and unexpected burst of the door and the appearance of the three large men with guns drawn creates a sense of shock and alarm. The fact that Bond is able to take down one of the gunmen, but is then quickly overpowered and disarmed, raises the stakes and creates a sense of uncertainty about what will happen next. The passage is masterfully crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen to Bond and how he will manage to escape from his predicament.
