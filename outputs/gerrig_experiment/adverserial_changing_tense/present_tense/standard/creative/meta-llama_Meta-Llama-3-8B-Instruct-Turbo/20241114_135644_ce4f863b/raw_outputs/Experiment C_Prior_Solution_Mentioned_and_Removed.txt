Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is heavily restrained, and Crushak has explicit orders to shoot him if he tries to escape or speak to him. Blofeld's office is also quite secure, with a large wall of glass that the bird crashes into, but which otherwise seems impenetrable. Given these circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it's clear that Bond is in a precarious situation, with no easy way out. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "very large and very ugly man" and "contorting his face into what he might have intended as a smile", creates a sense of unease and tension. The fact that Bond is heavily restrained and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak makes the situation feel intense and claustrophobic. The threat of death is also palpable, as Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he tries to escape or speak to him. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of high stakes and tension.
