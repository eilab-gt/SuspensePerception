Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld at this point. Bond is tied up in a chair, and Blofeld has a large and ugly gunman, Crushak, holding him captive. The situation looks grim for Bond.

The description of the setting, including the darkness of the office, adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape or what will happen to him next.
