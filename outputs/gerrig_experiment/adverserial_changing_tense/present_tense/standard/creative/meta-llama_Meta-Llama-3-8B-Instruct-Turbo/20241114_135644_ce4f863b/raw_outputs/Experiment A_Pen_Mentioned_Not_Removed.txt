Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, as he has just been caught and disarmed, and Le Chiffre has his gunmen keeping watch over him.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a turning point in the story where Bond's plan to escape has failed, and he's now at the mercy of his assassins. The use of swift and intense action, the quick thinking and physical agility of Bond, and the menacing tone of Le Chiffre all contribute to a sense of high tension and suspense.
