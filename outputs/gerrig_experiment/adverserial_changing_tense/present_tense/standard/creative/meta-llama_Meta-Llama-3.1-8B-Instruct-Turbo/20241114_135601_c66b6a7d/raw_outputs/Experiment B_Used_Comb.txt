Based on the provided information and the given passage, I will answer the questions as follows:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**
1. Not very likely

In the given passage, Bond's confidence and situation have changed significantly since his initial defeat of Le Chiffre. He is now caught off guard, surrounded, and his possessions (even as trivial as a comb) are being used against him. The description also implies that Bond is feeling puny and impotent, which suggests that his chances of escape are not looking good at this moment.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it introduces an unexpected turn of events, where Bond, who was previously the protagonist, is suddenly caught and on the defensive. The use of phrases like "The door bursts in toward him" and "Bond feels puny and impotent" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, keeping the reader engaged and curious about what will happen next. The sudden shift in power dynamics and the vivid descriptions of the scene contribute to the high level of suspense.
