***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
 
Answer: 1. Not very likely

Given the situation described in the passage, Bond has already been taken prisoner by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He was able to briefly evade the Corsican's attack, but was ultimately caught, disarmed, and is now being held by Le Chiffre's men. It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from this predicament, at least in the short term.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond attempts to escape from the Corsican's attack and evade capture. The quick action, the author's vivid descriptions of the fight scene, and the dark and ominous atmosphere all contribute to a sense of uncertainty and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape, and whether he will be able to overcome the odds against him.
