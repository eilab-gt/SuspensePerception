**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

Based on the passage, the situation appears to be against Bond. He has already been captured by Blofeld and his gunman, Crushak, and is being tied up in a chair. He also suffered a setback when he was caught by Crushak after making a brief escape from Blofeld. Considering the above factors, I would rate it as:

**1. Not very likely**

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

The passage is building up tension and suspense with the description of Bond being captured and tied up. It also hints at a sinister plot by Blofeld and his gunman, Crushak, which creates a sense of unease. The author's description of Crushak as "very large and very ugly" and the graphic details of Bond being tied up add to the tension. I would rate it as:

**6. Very suspenseful**
