Based on the provided passage, I will answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
My answer is: 2. Somewhat likely

Although Bond is initially pinned down and guarded by a large and formidable man, he has demonstrated his resourcefulness in the past by outwitting a guard. The fact that he was able to take advantage of the distraction caused by the bird to create an opportunity to move against Blofeld suggests that he may be able to come up with another plan to escape, especially given his past experiences.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
My answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger for the protagonist. The reader is aware that Bond is a captive and that he is in a precarious situation, with no clear way out. The descriptions of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the pain and danger that Bond faces create tension and suspense. The tone of the passage is ominous, with Blofeld's words and actions making it clear that he is determined to eliminate Bond, making the reader wonder what will happen next
