***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is being held captive by two heavily armed and formidable individuals, Blofeld and Crushak. Bond's previous attempts to escape have been thwarted, and he is now being restrained with piano wire. Additionally, Blofeld has made it clear that he has taken measures to prevent Bond from escaping, implying that Bond's chances of escape are low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkness, and the appearance of the large and menacing Crushak all contribute to a sense of uncertainty and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape. The passage also creates a sense of unease due to the graphic description of Bond's physical restraint and the threat of violence.
