***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being overpowered by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, and being tied up in a chair with piano wire. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him, which suggests that Bond's chances of escape are low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tense and ominous moments, such as the bird crashing into the wall, the sudden darkness, and the appearance of the large and intimidating henchman, Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions and the sense of danger and confinement create a high level of suspense, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing the tension and fear.
