**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned. He is being held by two gunmen, and Le Chiffre is watching closely. Although Bond is able to evade the Corsican's initial attack and manages to hide his fountain pen, it is eventually discovered. This implies that Bond's chances of escape are low, at least for the time being.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his men. The quick and agile movements of the Corsican, the sound of the gun being trained on Bond's chest, and the discovery of the fountain pen all contribute to a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way out of this situation.
