The correct answer is:

1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being caught and searched by Le Chiffre's men.

The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape. The correct answer is:

6. Very suspenseful
