**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation. He has been caught by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, and is being restrained with piano wire. The fact that Bond is being left to contemplate his behavior with Crushak, a man devoted to eliminating irritations, implies that Bond's chances of escape are slim. Additionally, the passage does not provide any indication that Bond has a plan or opportunity to escape, making it seem unlikely that he will escape from Blofeld.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, James Bond. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkening of the room, and the appearance of the large and ugly henchman, Crushak, all contribute to a sense of uncertainty and foreboding. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "very large and very ugly man" and "contorts his face into what he might have intended as a smile," adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The passage also implies that Bond is in a desperate situation, which heightens the sense of tension and suspense
