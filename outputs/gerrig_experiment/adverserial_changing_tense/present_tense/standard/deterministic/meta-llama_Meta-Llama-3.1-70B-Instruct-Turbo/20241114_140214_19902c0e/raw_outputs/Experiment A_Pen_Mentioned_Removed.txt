***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 2. Somewhat likely

Although Bond is currently a prisoner and has been disarmed, he has already shown his resourcefulness and quick thinking by attempting to escape and trying to hide his fountain pen. This suggests that he may still have a plan or an opportunity to escape, but the odds are against him.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Bond's sudden decision to escape, the Corsican's quick reflexes, and Le Chiffre's sinister presence. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "slams himself back", and "twists it sharply" creates a sense of urgency and violence, keeping the reader on edge. The fact that Bond's plan is not fully revealed and that Le Chiffre seems to be one step ahead of him adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
