***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and despite being tied up, he has already shown his ability to think on his feet and take advantage of distractions. The fact that he was able to create a diversion and attempt to escape earlier in the passage suggests that he will likely try to find another way to escape, even in his current situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of physical restraints, such as the piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and vulnerability. The fact that Blofeld is leaving Bond with Crushak, who is described as "devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life," creates a sense of impending doom and raises the stakes for Bond's survival.
