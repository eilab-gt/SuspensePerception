Based on the passage, I would answer: 2. Somewhat likely

Although Bond has been caught off guard and is currently trapped, his quick thinking and agility in the initial confrontation suggest that he may still have a chance to escape. However, the fact that he is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and has been disarmed, makes his situation precarious.
