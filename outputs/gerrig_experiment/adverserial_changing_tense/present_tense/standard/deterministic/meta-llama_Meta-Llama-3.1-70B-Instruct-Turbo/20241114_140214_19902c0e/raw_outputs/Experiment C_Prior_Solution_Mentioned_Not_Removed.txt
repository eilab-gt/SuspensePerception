***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as 6. Very likely. This is because Bond has already demonstrated his ability to think on his feet and take advantage of distractions, as seen when the bird crashes into the glass wall. Additionally, Bond has a history of outwitting his captors, as mentioned by Blofeld. Although he is currently tied up, it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape, given his resourcefulness and experience.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and facing a potentially deadly situation. The introduction of the large and ugly man, Mr. Crushak, adds to the sense of danger, and the use of piano wire to tie Bond up creates a sense of urgency and desperation. The fact that Blofeld mentions Bond's previous escape and the consequences for his guard also raises the stakes, making the reader wonder if Bond will be able to escape again.
