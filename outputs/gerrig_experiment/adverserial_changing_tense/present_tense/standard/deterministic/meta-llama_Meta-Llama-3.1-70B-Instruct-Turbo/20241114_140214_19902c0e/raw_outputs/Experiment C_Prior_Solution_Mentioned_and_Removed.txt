***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and despite being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it is likely that he will find a way to escape. The passage also hints at Bond's past ability to outwit his captors, which suggests that he may be able to do so again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of piano wire to tie Bond up adds to the sense of danger and vulnerability, and the threat of being shot if he attempts to speak to Crushak raises the stakes. The passage effectively builds suspense and creates a sense of urgency, leaving the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape.
