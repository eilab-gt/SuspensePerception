Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and outgunned, and have already disarmed him. Bond's attempts to fight back have been unsuccessful, and he is now being searched and stripped of his weapons.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and that he is being held captive by a ruthless criminal. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistle of pain", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is also left wondering what will happen next, and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
