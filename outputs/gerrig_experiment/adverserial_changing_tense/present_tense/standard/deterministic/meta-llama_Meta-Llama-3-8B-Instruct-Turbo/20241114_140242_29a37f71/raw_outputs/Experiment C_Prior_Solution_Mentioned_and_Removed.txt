Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is now a prisoner, tied up in a chair, and being guarded by a large and formidable man named Crushak. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him, making it even more difficult for Bond to escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak, and that any attempt to escape will likely result in harm or death. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive his captivity.
