Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, given that he is now a prisoner, surrounded by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, and has been disarmed. Bond's attempts to defend himself, such as shoving one of the gunmen with his heel, have been unsuccessful, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden burst of the door and the appearance of the three men, guns drawn, is a shocking and intense moment. The fact that Bond is disarmed and trapped, with no clear way to escape, adds to the sense of suspense. The description of Bond's feelings of puniness and impotence also adds to the sense of tension and danger, making the reader feel like Bond is in a precarious situation.
