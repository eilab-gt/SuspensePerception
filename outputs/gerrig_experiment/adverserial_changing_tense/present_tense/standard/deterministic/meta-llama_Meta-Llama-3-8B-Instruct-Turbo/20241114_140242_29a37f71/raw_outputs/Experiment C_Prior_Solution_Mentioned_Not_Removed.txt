Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's captivity, given that he is being held by two gunmen, including the large and ugly Crushak, and is being restrained by piano wire. Bond's attempts to escape so far have been unsuccessful, and it seems that Blofeld has taken measures to ensure that Bond will not be able to outwit him again.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by a villainous character and his henchmen. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia, as Bond is trapped in the armchair with no clear way to escape. The threat of physical harm, as evidenced by the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of danger and suspense. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
