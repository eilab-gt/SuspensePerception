Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point, as he is being held by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. Bond's plan to "do as much damage as possible" to the gunmen has been foiled, and he is now being searched and stripped of his weapons. The situation appears to be under Le Chiffre's control, making it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held by his captors, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistle of pain", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape or survive their ordeal. The suspense is heightened by the fact that Bond's plan to escape has been foiled, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.
