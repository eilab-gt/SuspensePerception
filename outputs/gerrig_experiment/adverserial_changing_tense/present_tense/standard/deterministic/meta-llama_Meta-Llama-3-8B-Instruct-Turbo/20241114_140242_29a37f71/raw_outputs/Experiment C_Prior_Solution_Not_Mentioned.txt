Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches, given that he is currently tied up in a chair and surrounded by Blofeld's henchmen. Bond's attempts to escape so far have been unsuccessful, and it seems that Blofeld has taken measures to ensure that Bond is securely contained.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" man Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate, such as whether he will be able to escape or if he will be subjected to further torture or harm. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
