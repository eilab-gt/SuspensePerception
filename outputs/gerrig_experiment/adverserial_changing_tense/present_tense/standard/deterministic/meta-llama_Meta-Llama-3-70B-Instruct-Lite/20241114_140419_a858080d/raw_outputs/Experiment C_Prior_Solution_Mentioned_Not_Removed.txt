***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being a skilled secret agent, he has a good track record of escaping from difficult situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "painfully" biting piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this situation.
