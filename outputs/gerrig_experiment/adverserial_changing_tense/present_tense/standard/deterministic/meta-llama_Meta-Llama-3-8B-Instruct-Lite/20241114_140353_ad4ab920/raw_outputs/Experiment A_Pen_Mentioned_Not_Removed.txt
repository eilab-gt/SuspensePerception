Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is being held captive and disarmed, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashes to the ground", and "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest" creates a sense of tension and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
