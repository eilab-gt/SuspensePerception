Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained by piano wire wrapped around his arms and the chair. This makes it difficult for him to escape, so it is not very likely that he will escape from Blofeld's clutches at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held captive by a villainous character, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of descriptive language, such as "large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia, as Bond is trapped in a small, dark room with no clear way out. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
