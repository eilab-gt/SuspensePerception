Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his current predicament.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of the events unfolding is vivid and intense. The use of words like "crashes", "stumbles", "knocking out the large light", and "contorts his face into what he might have intended as a smile" creates a sense of chaos and unpredictability, making the reader feel on edge. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is being subjected to physical harm (the piano wire) adds to the sense of suspense and danger. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader engaged and concerned for Bond's well-being.
