Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Crushak has been instructed to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him, which further limits Bond's options for escape. Therefore, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by a powerful and ruthless villain, and is being subjected to physical restraint and intimidation. The use of vivid language, such as "large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or survive the ordeal. The passage is also full of ominous and threatening statements, such as Blofeld's declaration that Crushak will "eliminate" Bond, which adds to the sense of suspense and danger.
