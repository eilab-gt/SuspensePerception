Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has just been disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is being held captive and disarmed, and it's unclear what will happen to him next. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashes to the ground", and "unquiet chest" creates a sense of tension and danger, making the reader feel on edge and worried about Bond's fate. The passage also builds suspense by hinting at the possibility of violence and harm coming to Bond, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
