***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being overpowered by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, and being tied up in a chair with piano wire. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak is to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him, which suggests that Bond is in a precarious and vulnerable position. This makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of elements that create suspense, such as the sudden interruption of the bird crashing into the wall, the darkening of the room, and the introduction of a new and intimidating henchman, Crushak. The description of Bond being tied up and threatened with being shot also adds to the tension and suspense. The passage effectively creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, making it extremely suspenseful.
