**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre and his men, and is now being searched and disarmed. This suggests that his escape plan has been foiled, at least for the moment. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is not very high at this point.

The answer is: 1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and action-packed scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre's men. The use of words like "suddenly", "like lightning", and "agilely" creates a sense of urgency and quick movement, which adds to the suspense. The fact that Bond's plan is foiled and he is being disarmed and searched also creates a sense of tension and uncertainty about what will happen next.

The answer is: 6. Very suspenseful
