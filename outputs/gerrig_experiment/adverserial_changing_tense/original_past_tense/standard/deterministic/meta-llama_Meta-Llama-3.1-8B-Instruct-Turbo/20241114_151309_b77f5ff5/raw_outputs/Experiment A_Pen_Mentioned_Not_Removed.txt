Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been caught and disarmed by Le Chiffre's men, and he is now being searched and handled roughly. This implies that Bond's escape is unlikely at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being caught and disarmed by Le Chiffre's men. The use of words like "suddenly", "like lightning", and "agilely" creates a sense of quick and dynamic action, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The fact that Bond is being handled roughly and disarmed also adds to the suspense, as it implies that he may be in grave danger.
