***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being overpowered by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, and being tied up in a chair with piano wire. This suggests that Bond is currently in a vulnerable position and is not in a position to escape easily. Additionally, Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken steps to prevent Bond from escaping.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid descriptions of the setting and the actions of the characters creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about Bond's fate. The fact that Bond is tied up and unable to escape adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
