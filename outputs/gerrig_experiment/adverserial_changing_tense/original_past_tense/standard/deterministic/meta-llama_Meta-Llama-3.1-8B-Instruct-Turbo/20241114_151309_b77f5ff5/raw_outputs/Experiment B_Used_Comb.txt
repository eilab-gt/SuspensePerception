**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is caught off guard by the sudden attack and is unable to escape. He is overpowered by the three men, and his attempts to defend himself are thwarted. Although he is able to dodge one of the gunmen's attacks, he is ultimately unable to escape or overpower his captors. This implies that his chances of escape are low.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden and unexpected attack on Bond creates a sense of surprise and alarm, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from his captors. The description of Bond's agility and quick thinking in dodging the first gunman's attack adds to the suspense, as does the sense of powerlessness and vulnerability that Bond feels as he is overpowered by the three men. The passage effectively builds tension and keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
