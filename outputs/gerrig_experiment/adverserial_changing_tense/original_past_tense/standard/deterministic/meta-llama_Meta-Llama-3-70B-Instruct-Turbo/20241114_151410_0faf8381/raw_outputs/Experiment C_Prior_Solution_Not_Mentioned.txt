***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his cunning and ability to escape from tight spots. It's likely that Bond will find a way to escape, possibly using his surroundings to his advantage or exploiting a weakness in his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense from the start, with Bond being held at gunpoint and then taking advantage of a distraction to try and escape. The introduction of the large and ugly Mr. Crushak adds to the sense of danger, and the description of Bond being tied up with piano wire creates a vivid and uncomfortable image. The passage ends with Bond being left to contemplate his situation, leaving the reader wondering how he will escape and what will happen next.
