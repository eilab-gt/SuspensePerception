***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage shows Bond being outsmarted and captured by Blofeld, and being tied up by Crushak. However, Bond has a history of escaping from captivity, as mentioned in the passage. Therefore, it's difficult to say how likely it is that Bond will escape this time.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the wall, Bond's attempt to escape, and his subsequent capture and restraint by Crushak. The description of Crushak's ugly appearance and the painful binding of Bond with piano wire adds to the sense of danger and unease, making the passage very suspenseful.
