Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is now a prisoner, tied up in a chair, and being guarded by two heavily armed men. Blofeld has also made it clear that he intends to eliminate any irritations from his life, including Bond.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, adds to the sense of menace, and Blofeld's cold and calculating demeanor makes him a formidable opponent. The use of vivid language, such as "crashed into the wall of glass", "knocking out the large light", and "bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
