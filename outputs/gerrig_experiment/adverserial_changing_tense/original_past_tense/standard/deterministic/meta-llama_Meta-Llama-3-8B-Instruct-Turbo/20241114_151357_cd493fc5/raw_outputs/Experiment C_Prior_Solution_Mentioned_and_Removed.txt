Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's captivity, given that he is being held by two gunmen, including the large and ugly Crushak, who is specifically tasked with eliminating any attempts to escape or speak to him. Additionally, Bond is being physically restrained by the piano wire, making it difficult for him to move or take action.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and that any attempt to escape or resist will likely result in harm or death. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive his captivity.
