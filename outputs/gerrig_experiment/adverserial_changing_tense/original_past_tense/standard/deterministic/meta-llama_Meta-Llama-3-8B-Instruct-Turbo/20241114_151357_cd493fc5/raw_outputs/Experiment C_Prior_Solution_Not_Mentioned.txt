Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. Bond is also being restrained by piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to move or escape.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held captive by Blofeld, who is not happy with him. The use of a large and ugly man, Crushak, adds to the sense of menace and danger. The description of the wire being wrapped around Bond's arms and the pain it causes adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape.
