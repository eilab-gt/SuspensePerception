Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, given that he is now a prisoner, surrounded by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, and has been disarmed. Bond's attempts to defend himself, such as catching one of the gunmen with his heel, were unsuccessful, and he was quickly overpowered.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden and unexpected burst of the door, the guns drawn, and the physical confrontation between Bond and the gunmen create a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is trapped and disarmed adds to the sense of suspense, making the reader wonder how he will escape and what will happen next.
