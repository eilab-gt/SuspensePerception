Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and outgunned, and he has already been subdued and disarmed.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trying to escape and rescue Vesper, but he is being thwarted at every turn by Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand", adds to the sense of tension and excitement. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape and overcome his captors.
