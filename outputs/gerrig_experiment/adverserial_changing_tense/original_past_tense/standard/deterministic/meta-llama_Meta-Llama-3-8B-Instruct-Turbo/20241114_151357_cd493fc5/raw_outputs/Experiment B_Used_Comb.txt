Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him trapped and disarmed. Bond's attempts to defend himself, such as shoving one of the gunmen with his heel, were unsuccessful, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden burst of the door and the appearance of the three men, including Le Chiffre, is a shocking and unexpected twist. The description of Bond's attempts to defend himself and his subsequent capture creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about how he will escape. The passage also creates a sense of vulnerability and helplessness, as Bond feels "puny and impotent" in the face of his captors. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of suspense and tension.
