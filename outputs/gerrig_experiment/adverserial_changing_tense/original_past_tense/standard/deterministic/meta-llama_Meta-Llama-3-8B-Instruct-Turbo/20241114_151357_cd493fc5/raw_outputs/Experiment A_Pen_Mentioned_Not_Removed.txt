Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and outgunned, and he has already been caught and disarmed. Bond's plan to "do as much damage as possible" to the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper has not gone as planned, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and that he is being held captive by a criminal organization. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistled past his hip", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond's plan has been foiled and he is now at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of uncertainty and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
