Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point, as he is being held by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and his attempts to resist have been thwarted. Le Chiffre has also taken away Bond's fountain pen, which could be used as a weapon.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his men, and it seems like he is at their mercy. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistled of pain", adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
