***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has managed to cause some chaos and distraction, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. It's unclear what opportunities Bond might have to escape, but it's also clear that Bond is a resourceful character who often finds ways to get out of tight spots.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond in a precarious situation and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The fact that Bond is unable to speak to Crushak and is at risk of being shot if he tries to escape adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes. Overall, the passage effectively creates a sense of suspense and tension, leaving the reader wondering what will happen to Bond next.
