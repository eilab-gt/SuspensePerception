***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has managed to escape from difficult situations before, the passage doesn't provide any clear indication of how he might escape this time, and the fact that he's been tied up by Crushak suggests that his situation is precarious.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The fact that Bond's escape is uncertain also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere.
