***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage shows Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, it is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations. The fact that Bond was able to outwit Blofeld's guard the last time he was held captive also suggests that he may be able to escape again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is being held captive by a villainous character, Blofeld, and is at the mercy of his henchman, Crushak. The use of a gun and piano wire to restrain Bond adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes. The fact that Blofeld mentions a previous guard who died after being outwitted by Bond also creates a sense of foreboding and raises the question of whether Bond will be able to escape again.
