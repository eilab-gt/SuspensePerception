***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, the passage suggests that Bond is resourceful and skilled, as evidenced by his quick thinking and agility in the initial confrontation. Additionally, the fact that Bond is the protagonist of the novel and has already achieved his initial goal of causing Le Chiffre to lose a considerable amount of money suggests that he will likely find a way to escape or turn the tables on his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of sudden and intense danger. The peaceful scene of Bond preparing for dinner is abruptly shattered by the violent entrance of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of action verbs like "burst", "leapt", and "twisted" creates a sense of urgency and chaos. Additionally, the fact that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
