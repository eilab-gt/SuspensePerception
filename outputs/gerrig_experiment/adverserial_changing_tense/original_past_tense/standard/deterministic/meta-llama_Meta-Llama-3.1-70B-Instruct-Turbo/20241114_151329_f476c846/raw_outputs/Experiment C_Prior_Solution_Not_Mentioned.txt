***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and despite being tied up, he has already shown his ability to think on his feet and take advantage of distractions. The fact that he was able to create a diversion and attempt to escape earlier in the passage suggests that he will likely try to find another way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of physical restraints, such as the piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and vulnerability. The fact that Blofeld is clearly angry and intends to punish Bond also raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, making the reader wonder what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape.
