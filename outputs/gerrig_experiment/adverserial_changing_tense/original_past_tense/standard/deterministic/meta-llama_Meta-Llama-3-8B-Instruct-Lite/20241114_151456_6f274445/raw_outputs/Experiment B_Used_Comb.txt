Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped, and Le Chiffre has the upper hand, having caught him off guard and disarmed him. It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from his current predicament.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden and unexpected arrival of the gunmen, Bond's failed attempt to defend himself, and Le Chiffre's gloating and triumphant tone all contribute to a sense of foreboding and unease. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors.
