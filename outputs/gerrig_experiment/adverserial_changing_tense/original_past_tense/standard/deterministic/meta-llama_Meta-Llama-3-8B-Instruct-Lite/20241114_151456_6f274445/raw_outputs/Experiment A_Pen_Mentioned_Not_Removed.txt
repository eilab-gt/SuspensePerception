Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently in a precarious situation, having been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being searched, which makes it unlikely that he will escape from his captors.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is being held captive by a criminal organization. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashed to the ground", and "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel on edge. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond next, which adds to the suspense.
