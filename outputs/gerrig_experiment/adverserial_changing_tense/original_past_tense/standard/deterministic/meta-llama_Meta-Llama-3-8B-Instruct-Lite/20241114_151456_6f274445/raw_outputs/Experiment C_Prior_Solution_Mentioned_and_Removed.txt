Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained with piano wire. This makes it unlikely that he will escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The use of words like "gun", "pointing at his chest", "eliminating", and "shoot you if you even attempt to speak to him" creates a sense of tension and danger, making the reader feel that something bad could happen to Bond at any moment. The description of the characters' actions and the setting also adds to the suspense, making it a very suspenseful passage.
