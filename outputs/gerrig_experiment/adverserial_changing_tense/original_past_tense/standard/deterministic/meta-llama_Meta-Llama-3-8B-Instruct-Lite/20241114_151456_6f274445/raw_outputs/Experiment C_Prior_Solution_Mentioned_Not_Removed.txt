Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and is being restrained with piano wire. This makes it unlikely that he will escape on his own.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held captive by a villainous character, and is being subjected to physical harm (the wire wrapping around his arms). The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or not. The use of vivid language and descriptive details, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
