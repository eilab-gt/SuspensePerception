***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, we know that Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent who has escaped from difficult situations before. It's likely that he will find a way to escape, but it's not a guarantee.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful, as Bond is in a dangerous situation and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The description of Crushak tying Bond up with piano wire, which is "biting more painfully into Bond's flesh" with each twist, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The fact that Blofeld is explicitly stating his intention to have Bond eliminated by Crushak raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. Overall, the passage effectively builds tension and suspense, making the reader eager to find out what will happen next.
