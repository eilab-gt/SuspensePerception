***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has managed to cause some chaos and briefly gain the upper hand, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. However, Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, and it's possible that he may find a way to escape or outsmart his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and the painful way he ties Bond up adds to the sense of unease. The fact that Bond is not allowed to speak and is at risk of being shot if he tries to escape creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
