***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, so it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape. However, at this point in the story, it's unclear how he will manage to do so.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is building tension as Bond is caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and the description of the physical struggle and the stripping of Bond's weapons creates a sense of urgency and danger. The ending line "Let's not waste time" implies that something ominous is about to happen, adding to the suspense.
