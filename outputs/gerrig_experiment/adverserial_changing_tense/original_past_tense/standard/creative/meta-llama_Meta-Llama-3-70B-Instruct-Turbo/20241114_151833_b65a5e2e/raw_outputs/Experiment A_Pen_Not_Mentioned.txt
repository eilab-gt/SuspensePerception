Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage shows Bond being outsmarted and overpowered by Le Chiffre's henchmen, and he is currently a prisoner. However, it is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his cunning and ability to escape from tight spots. Therefore, it's difficult to say for certain whether he will escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the use of action, sudden twists, and Bond's precarious situation. The description of the fight, the Corsican's quick reflexes, and Le Chiffre's menacing presence all contribute to a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, which adds to the suspense.
