***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled spy and has a reputation for escaping from difficult situations. Although he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it is likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the "painfully" twisting piano wire, adds to the tension and suspense. The fact that Blofeld has left Bond alone with his henchman, Crushak, also creates a sense of unease and foreboding.
