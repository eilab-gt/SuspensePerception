***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond is a skilled agent, the passage suggests that he is currently at a disadvantage, having been caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond's quick thinking and agility in the passage also hint that he may have a plan or a chance to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tense and action-packed moments, such as Bond's sudden decision to attack, the quick exchange of moves between Bond and the Corsican, and the sense of danger and urgency as Bond is searched and threatened by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The passage effectively creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making it very suspenseful.
