Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

At this point in the passage, Bond has been caught off guard and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. While Bond has shown some agility and quick thinking, he is currently trapped and disarmed. However, since Bond is the protagonist and this is an action-adventure novel, it's likely that he will find a way to escape, but it's unclear how or when that will happen.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because Bond, who has been confident and in control up until this point, is suddenly caught off guard and at the mercy of his enemy. The sudden burst of violence and the efficient way Le Chiffre's gunmen search and disarm Bond creates a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape this predicament, which creates suspense and makes the passage engaging and thrilling.
