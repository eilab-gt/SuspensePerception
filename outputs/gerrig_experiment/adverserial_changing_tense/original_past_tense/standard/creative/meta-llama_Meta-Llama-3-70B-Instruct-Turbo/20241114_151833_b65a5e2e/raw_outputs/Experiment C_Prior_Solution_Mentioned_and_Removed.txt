***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, the situation seems dire, with him being tied up and guarded by a formidable and intimidating character like Crushak. However, it is also a James Bond novel, and Bond's escapes are a hallmark of the series, so it's impossible to say for certain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond in a precarious situation, trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the contorted smile on Crushak's face and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and raises the stakes for Bond's escape. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape, or if he will escape at all, which creates a sense of suspense and tension.
