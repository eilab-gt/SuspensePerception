***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does show Bond trying to escape, but it also shows Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, successfully capturing and restraining Bond. While Bond has escaped from similar situations in the past, there is no indication in this passage that he has a plan to escape or that he will be able to overcome his current restraints.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the use of sudden events (such as the bird crashing into the wall) and the cat-and-mouse game between Bond and Blofeld. The description of Crushak's ugly face and his actions (contorting his face into a "smile" and painfully twisting the piano wire around Bond's arms) adds to the sense of menace and danger. The passage ends with Bond in a precarious and vulnerable position, which heightens the suspense and leaves the reader wondering what will happen next.
