Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond has been outmaneuvered by Le Chiffre, and he is now a prisoner, with his gun and pen taken away. It is unlikely that he will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's grasp without some kind of intervention or clever plan.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage seems to ratchet up the tension and suspense as Bond is caught off guard and overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. The use of quick, snappy dialogue and vivid descriptions creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond as he tries to escape. The fact that Bond has been disarmed and his tools taken away adds to the sense of unease and uncertainty, making it hard to predict what will happen next.
