Answer the questions based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has explicitly instructed Crushak to shoot Bond if he tries to escape or speak to him. This sets a rather bleak scenario for Bond's chances of escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is trapped and helpless, with the threat of death looming over him. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful sensation of the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen to him next.
