Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap at this point. He is already a prisoner, tied up by Crushak, and Blofeld has positioned him in a chair, making it difficult for Bond to move or escape. Blofeld also has Crushak, a large and powerful man, to assist him in keeping Bond captive. The odds seem to be against Bond's escape.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held captive by Blofeld and Crushak, who are both formidable opponents. The sudden introduction of the bird crashing into the wall of glass adds to the surprise and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "a very large and very ugly man" and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on edge and wondering what will happen to Bond next.
