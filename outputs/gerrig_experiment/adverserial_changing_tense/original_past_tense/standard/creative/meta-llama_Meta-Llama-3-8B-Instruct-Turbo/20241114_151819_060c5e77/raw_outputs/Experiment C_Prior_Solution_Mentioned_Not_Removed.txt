Answering Question 1:

1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is now a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and there is no clear indication of how he will escape. Blofeld has taken measures to ensure Bond's captivity, including tying him up with piano wire, which makes it difficult for Bond to free himself. It seems unlikely that Bond will escape without some kind of plan or help.

Answering Question 2:

6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and uncertainty for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, which creates tension and anxiety. The description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the painful way Bond is tied up with piano wire adds to the sense of unease. The conversation between Blofeld and Bond, including Blofeld's threat to eliminate irritations from his life, suggests that Bond's fate is uncertain and potentially dire. The passage creates a sense of urgency and danger, making it very suspenseful.
