**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

Given the situation, it seems Bond is quite helpless at the moment, bound to a chair with piano wire by Blofeld's thug, Mr. Crushak. However, considering Bond's history of ingenious escapes and his reputation as a resourceful spy, I would rate his likelihood of escape as moderately likely (option 5). This rating acknowledges the challenge of his current predicament while also factoring in his proven track record of escaping from seemingly impossible situations.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

This passage is extremely suspenseful (option 7). It expertly sets up a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Bond in a precarious situation. The sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the glass wall creates a brief window of opportunity for Bond, but it's quickly shut down by Mr. Crushak. The passage masterfully builds tension through the descriptions of Blofeld's sinister demeanor, Mr. Crushak's ugliness and brutality, and the painful use of piano wire to restrain Bond. This all contributes to a thrilling and suspenseful reading experience.
