***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the provided passage, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is 2. Somewhat likely.

Bond is shown to be resourceful and determined as he attempts to follow Vesper and disrupt the gunmen. However, he is outnumbered, and his initial attempt at escape has been thwarted by the Corsican. Despite this, Bond's agility and pride in his physical abilities suggest that he might still have opportunities to escape or turn the situation around.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the passage as 6. Very suspenseful.

The passage effectively creates tension and suspense by showcasing Bond's desperate attempt to escape and follow Vesper, only to be caught and disarmed. The contrast between Bond's bravery and the odds against him creates a sense of urgency, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The Corsican's quick thinking and Le Chiffre's cold demeanor further heighten the tension, making the passage very suspenseful.
