***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose option 5: Moderately likely. Although Bond has managed to momentarily distract Blofeld and cause a commotion, he is ultimately caught by Blofeld's associate, Crushak, and secured in a chair with piano wire. However, Bond's resourcefulness and determination are characteristic of his role, so it is reasonable to assume that he may find a way to escape.
