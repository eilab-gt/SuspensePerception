***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the added context of the passage, I would answer: 
6. Very likely

James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, known for his ability to think on his feet and escape difficult situations. Although he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape, as he has done in the past.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Considering the added context of the passage, I would answer: 
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, from the initial crash of the bird into the glass wall to Bond's failed attempt to escape, and his subsequent capture and binding by Crushak. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak to him adds an extra layer of tension and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
