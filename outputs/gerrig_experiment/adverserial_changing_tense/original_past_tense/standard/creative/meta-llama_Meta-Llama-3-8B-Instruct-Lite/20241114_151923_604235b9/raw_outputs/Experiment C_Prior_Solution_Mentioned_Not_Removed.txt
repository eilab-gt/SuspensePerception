To answer Question 1, I would choose:

1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and they seem to have the upper hand. Bond's attempts to escape have been thwarted, and he is now being held captive in a chair with piano wire wrapping around his arms. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape in the short term.

To answer Question 2, I would choose:

6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it presents a tense and precarious situation for the protagonist, James Bond. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from his predicament, and the dark and ominous tone of the scene creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large bird" that crashes into the wall, and the "ugly" face of Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The fact that Bond is trapped and helpless, with no clear escape route, creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
