Answer 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"

1. Not very likely

Bond is being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he's been physically restrained in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms. The situation seems grim, with Crushak explicitly stating that he'll shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own.

Answer 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tense moments, with Bond being caught off guard, struggling to escape, and being restrained by Crushak. The atmosphere is ominous, with Blofeld's menacing tone and the threat of violence from Crushak. The fact that Bond is trapped and helpless makes the reader worry about his fate, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
