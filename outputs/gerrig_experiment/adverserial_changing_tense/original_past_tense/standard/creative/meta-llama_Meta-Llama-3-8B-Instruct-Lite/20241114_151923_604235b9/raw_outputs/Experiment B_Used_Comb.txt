**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

Bond has just been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it seems that he is outnumbered and outgunned. The fact that he is being searched, his revolver is taken away, and his comb is used as a taunt suggests that he is in a rather vulnerable position, making it less likely that he will escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden appearance of the gunmen, the swift and violent action, and the feeling of Bond's powerlessness all contribute to a sense of foreboding and unease. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and whether he will be able to overcome his captors. The use of vivid language, such as "guns drawn," "crashed to the ground," and "twisted it sharply," adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
