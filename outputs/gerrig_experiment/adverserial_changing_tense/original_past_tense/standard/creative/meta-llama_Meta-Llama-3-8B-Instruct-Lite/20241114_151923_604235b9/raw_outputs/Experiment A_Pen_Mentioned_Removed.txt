Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, as he has been overpowered by the two gunmen and has been disarmed of his revolver and fountain pen. He is being held at gunpoint, and his chances of escape appear slim.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being held captive and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his accomplices. The use of phrases such as "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins and brought a whistle of pain from him" and "As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket" creates a sense of action and danger, and the fact that Bond is being searched and disarmed raises the stakes and creates a sense of uncertainty and fear. The overall atmosphere is one of high tension and suspense.
