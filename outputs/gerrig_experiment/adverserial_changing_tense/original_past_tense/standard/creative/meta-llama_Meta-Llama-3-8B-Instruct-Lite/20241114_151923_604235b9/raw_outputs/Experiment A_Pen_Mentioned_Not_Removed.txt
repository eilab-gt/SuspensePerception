Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been captured and is now being held at gunpoint by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been unable to escape and has been overpowered. This makes it seem unlikely that he will escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and tension. The protagonist, James Bond, is in a precarious situation and is being held captive by his enemies. The passage creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next. The use of action and suspenseful language, such as "whistled of pain" and "twisted his shoe at the top of its arc", adds to the suspense and makes the reader feel like they are experiencing the events firsthand. The passage is also very descriptive, which helps to create a vivid image of the scene and draws the reader in, making it even more suspenseful.
