Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is surrounded by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have successfully disarmed him, so it seems unlikely that he will escape from them at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden and unexpected entrance of Le Chiffre and his men, the violent and rough search of Bond, and the feeling of impotence and helplessness that Bond experiences all contribute to a sense of suspense and unease. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the situation around.
