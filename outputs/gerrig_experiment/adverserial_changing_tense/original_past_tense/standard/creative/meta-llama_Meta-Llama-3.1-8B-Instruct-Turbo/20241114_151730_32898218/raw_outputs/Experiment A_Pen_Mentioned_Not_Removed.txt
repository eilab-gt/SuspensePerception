Answering Question 1: 
Given that Bond has just been captured by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it is likely that Bond will face significant challenges to escape from them. However, Bond is shown to be resourceful and agile in the passage. He uses his quick thinking and body movements to minimize damage and almost avoid getting caught by the Corsican. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond's escape seems moderately possible, despite the circumstances.

So, I would choose: 5. Moderately likely

Answering Question 2: 
The passage is quite suspenseful, as it depicts Bond in a difficult situation where he has been captured by his enemies and has to use his skills to avoid being severely harmed. The passage includes several intense moments, such as Bond being caught by the Corsican's swift action, the gunfire being drawn on him, and the attempt to retrieve his pen, which could be a potential tool for him. These elements create a sense of tension and anticipation, which are hallmarks of suspenseful writing.

So, I would choose: 7. Extremely suspenseful
