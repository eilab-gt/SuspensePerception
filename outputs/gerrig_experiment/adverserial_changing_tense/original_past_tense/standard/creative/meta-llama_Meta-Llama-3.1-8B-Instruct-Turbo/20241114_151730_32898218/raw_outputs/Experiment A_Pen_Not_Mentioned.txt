Answering Question 1: 
Based on the passage, it seems that Le Chiffre and his men have the upper hand. They have Bond and Vesper imprisoned and are now disarming him. They have planned a successful trap for Bond and are taking control of the situation. Given this information, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre at this point seems low. Therefore, I would rate it as:

1. Not very likely

Answering Question 2: 
This passage seems to have a high level of tension and danger as Bond is captured by the enemy and his friends are in danger. The events are unfolding rapidly, and the passage creates a sense of urgency. It also raises questions about what will happen next, which adds to the suspense. I would rate it as:

7. Extremely suspenseful
