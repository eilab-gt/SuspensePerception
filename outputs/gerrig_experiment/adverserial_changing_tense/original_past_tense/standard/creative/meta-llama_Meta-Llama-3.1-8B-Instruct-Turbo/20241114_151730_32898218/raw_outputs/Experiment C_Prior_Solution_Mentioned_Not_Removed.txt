Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely
The passage suggests that Bond's attempt to escape has already been thwarted. He was met by a second gunman, Crushak, and was tied up by him. Blofeld also implies that Bond will not be able to outsmart Crushak this time, as he did the previous time Bond was in captivity.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful
The passage is suspenseful because Bond is already a captive and being manipulated by Blofeld. The use of dark and the introduction of a second, even larger and more menacing, gunman adds to the tension and raises the stakes for Bond's escape or survival.
