Based on the provided passage, here are the answers to the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would rate this as: **1. Not very likely**

Given that Bond is currently tied up by piano wire in a wooden arm chair, with a large and ugly man watching him and Blofeld making a statement that suggests he will be left with Mr. Crushak to contemplate his behavior, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape without further action from outside.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"***
I would rate this as: **7. Extremely suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense and dark atmosphere, with Bond being captured by Blofeld and his henchman, and being subjected to physical restraints and threats. The author's description of the situation, including the sudden interruption of the bird crashing into the glass wall, and the menacing tone of Blofeld and Crushak, all contribute to a sense of suspense and tension, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
