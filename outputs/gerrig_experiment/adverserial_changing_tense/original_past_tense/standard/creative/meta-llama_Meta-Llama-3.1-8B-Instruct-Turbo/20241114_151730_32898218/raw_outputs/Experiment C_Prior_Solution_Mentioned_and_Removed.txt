**Answer Question 1:**
The correct answer is 1. Not very likely

The passage indicates that Bond is trapped and restrained by piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, there is a large and ugly man, Crushak, who is explicitly stated to be devoted to eliminating any irritations from Blofeld's life, and is instructed to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him. These circumstances make it seem unlikely for Bond to escape at the moment.

**Answer Question 2:**
The correct answer is 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the use of action and violence, such as the bird crashing into the wall, Bond's hasty escape attempt, and Crushak's menacing appearance and threat to shoot Bond if he speaks to him. The fact that Bond is captured and restrained, and the ominous presence of a large and violent man like Crushak, contribute to a very suspenseful atmosphere in the passage.
