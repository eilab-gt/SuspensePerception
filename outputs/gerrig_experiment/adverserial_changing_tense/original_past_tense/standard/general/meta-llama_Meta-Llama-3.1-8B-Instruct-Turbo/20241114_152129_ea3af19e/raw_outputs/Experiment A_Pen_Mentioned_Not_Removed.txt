Based on the passage, the answer to Question 1 is:

1. Not very likely

This is because Bond has already been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. He has also been dragged to his feet and is now being searched. The fact that Le Chiffre is observing the search attentively and seems to be in control of the situation suggests that Bond's chances of escape are low.

Based on the passage, the answer to Question 2 is:

6. Very suspenseful

This is because the passage creates a sense of tension and urgency as Bond is caught and disarmed. The use of words like "lightning" and "delicately" to describe the Corsican's actions creates a sense of quickness and agility, which adds to the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being searched and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men creates a sense of uncertainty and danger, which contributes to the suspensefulness of the passage.
