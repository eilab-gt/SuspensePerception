**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a difficult situation. He has been caught by Blofeld and is now a prisoner, tied up in a chair by the large and ugly man, Crushak. The fact that Blofeld has a large and devoted henchman, and that Bond is tied up and unable to escape, makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, James Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is a prisoner and is being held captive by a villainous character, Blofeld. The description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the painful binding of Bond to the chair adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape. The use of words like "crashed", "gunshot", and "painfully" also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
