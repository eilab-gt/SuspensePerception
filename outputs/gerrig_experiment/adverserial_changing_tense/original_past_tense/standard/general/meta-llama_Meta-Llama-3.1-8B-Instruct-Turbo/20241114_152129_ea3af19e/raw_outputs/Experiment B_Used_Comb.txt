Based on the passage, I will answer the questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being caught off guard by Le Chiffre and his men, and despite his agility and quick thinking, he is unable to escape or defend himself effectively. The fact that he is being searched, stripped of his revolver, and has his comb taken away suggests that he is at a disadvantage and his chances of escape are low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of sudden and unexpected events, such as the door bursting open, the gunmen jumping in, and Bond being caught off guard. The use of action verbs like "burst", "leapt", "shove", "twisted", and "crashed" creates a sense of urgency and tension. Additionally, the description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" adds to the sense of suspense and raises questions about what will happen next. The passage effectively builds tension and creates a sense of uncertainty, making it extremely suspenseful.
