***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being captured by Blofeld and being restrained by piano wire, with a guard watching him. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him, making it clear that any attempt to escape would be met with deadly force. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is captured and restrained, with a guard watching him and a clear understanding that any attempt to escape would be met with violence. The description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the use of physical restraints like piano wire adds to the sense of menace and foreboding, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
