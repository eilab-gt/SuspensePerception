Answering Question 1: 
Given the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Despite his initial attempt to escape and cause damage, he was thwarted by the Corsican, and his revolver and fountain pen were confiscated. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are currently low. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is:

1. Not very likely

Answering Question 2: 
The passage is quite suspenseful because it describes a tense situation where Bond is trying to escape from his captors. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape, and the use of action-packed language, such as "Like lightning," and "With a backward kick," creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage also leaves the reader with a cliffhanger, as Bond's plan is foiled, and he is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre. Therefore, the answer to Question 2 is:

6. Very suspenseful
