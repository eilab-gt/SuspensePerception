**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been caught and is now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He was caught while trying to escape and has been disarmed. This indicates that his chances of escape are currently low.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is trying to escape from his captors. The use of action verbs like "hurled", "slammed", "twisted", and "brusquely" creates a sense of urgency and tension. The fact that Bond is being disarmed and the outcome of the situation is uncertain adds to the suspense.
