I'll answer the questions based on the original passage provided, not the additional passage that was added later.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond is a skilled secret agent, he is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, which puts him at a disadvantage. However, Bond's past experiences and skills suggest that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage sets up a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped by Blofeld, and the reader is left wondering how they will manage to escape or what will happen to them next. The passage creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, making it suspenseful.
