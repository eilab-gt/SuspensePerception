***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't give a clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond has shown some resourcefulness and agility, he is currently at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond in a precarious situation and trying to think on his feet. The use of active verbsody language, such as "hurtle", "slammed", "whistled", and "crashed", adds to the sense of intensity and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape.
