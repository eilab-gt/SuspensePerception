Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have him outnumbered and outgunned. He has already been caught off guard and disarmed, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without some kind of plan or help.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held at gunpoint, and it's unclear how he will be able to escape or what will happen to him. The use of vivid language and quick action adds to the suspense, making it feel like anything could happen at any moment.
