Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him trapped and disarmed. Bond's attempts to defend himself, although impressive, were unsuccessful, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dire situation for Bond. The sudden and unexpected burst into his hotel room, the use of guns, and the disarming of Bond all create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is trapped and impotent adds to the sense of suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen to him next.
