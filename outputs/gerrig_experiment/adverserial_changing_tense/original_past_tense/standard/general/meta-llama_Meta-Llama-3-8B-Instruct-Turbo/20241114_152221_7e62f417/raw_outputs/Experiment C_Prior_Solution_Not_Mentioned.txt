Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, given that they have taken him prisoner and are holding him captive. Bond is tied up in a chair and has no clear means of escape.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak, which creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "very large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
