Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, as he is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and has been disarmed. Bond's plan to do damage to the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper has been foiled, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is being held captive, and it's unclear what will happen to him next. The description of the action is vivid and intense, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape or what Le Chiffre's intentions are. The use of words like "spidery", "whistled", and "delicately" adds to the suspenseful atmosphere, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
