Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point, as he is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. Bond's plan to "do as much damage as possible" to the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper has been foiled, and he is now being searched and disarmed. The situation looks bleak for Bond.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and that he is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The description of the action is vivid and intense, with Bond's attempt to escape and the Corsican's quick reflexes creating a sense of urgency. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be caught and possibly harmed. The suspense is heightened by the fact that Bond's plans have been foiled, and that he is now at the mercy of his captors.
