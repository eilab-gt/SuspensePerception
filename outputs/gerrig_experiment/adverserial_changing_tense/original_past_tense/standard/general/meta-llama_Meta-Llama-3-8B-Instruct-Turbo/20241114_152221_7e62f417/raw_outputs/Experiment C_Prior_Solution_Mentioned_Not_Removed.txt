Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has just announced that Crushak will be responsible for keeping him captive. This makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches in the immediate future.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is gloating over his capture. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkness, and the appearance of Crushak all add to the sense of surprise and danger. The description of Crushak as "very large and very ugly" also creates a sense of unease. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
