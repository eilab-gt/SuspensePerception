Here are the answers:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Bond if he tries to escape or speak to him. Additionally, Crushak is described as a large and ugly man, implying that he may be a formidable opponent. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is threatening to kill him if he tries to escape. The description of Crushak as a large and ugly man adds to the sense of menace, and the use of vivid language to describe the wire biting into Bond's flesh creates a sense of physical discomfort. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.
