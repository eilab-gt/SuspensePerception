***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and the passage already shows him attempting to escape and creating a distraction. Although Blofeld has him tied up, Bond's history of outwitting his captors (as mentioned in the passage) suggests that he may find a way to escape again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and threatened by Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of violence (the bird crashing into the glass wall, the gun being fired) and the physical pain inflicted on Bond (the piano wire biting into his flesh) adds to the suspense. Additionally, the passage sets up a sense of danger and unpredictability, making the reader wonder what will happen to Bond next.
