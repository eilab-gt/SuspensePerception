***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage shows Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it's essential to consider the character of James Bond and the typical plot progression of a Bond novel. Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations. Given this, it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a high level of suspense by putting Bond in a precarious situation, with his life hanging in the balance. The use of a sudden distraction (the bird crashing into the wall) and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape creates tension, which is then heightened by the introduction of the menacing character, Mr. Crushak. The fact that Blofeld has given Crushak orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
