***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would rate this as 6. Very likely.

Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, the passage suggests that Bond is resourceful and quick-thinking, as evidenced by his attempt to escape when the bird crashes into the glass wall. Additionally, James Bond is a character known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, so it is likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate this as 7. Extremely suspenseful.

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the use of action, dialogue, and description. The sudden crash of the bird into the glass wall creates a dramatic and unexpected distraction, and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. The introduction of the henchman, Mr. Crushak, adds to the sense of danger and menace, and the use of piano wire to tie Bond up creates a sense of physical pain and discomfort. Overall, the passage is extremely suspenseful and effectively builds tension
