***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the situation, I would rate it as 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond has been caught off guard and is currently trapped, his previous actions in the story suggest that he is resourceful and skilled. Additionally, the James Bond character is known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, so it's likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate it as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency as Bond is suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by Le Chiffre and his men. The use of action words like "burst," "leapt," and "twisted" creates a sense of intensity and danger. Additionally, the fact that Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of his enemies adds to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
