***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently a prisoner, the passage showcases his resourcefulness, agility, and quick thinking, as evidenced by his attempt to attack the gunmen and his subtle movement of the fountain pen into his breast pocket. These traits suggest that Bond may still have a chance to escape or turn the tables on his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is filled with tense moments, such as Bond's sudden decision to attack the gunmen, the Corsican's quick reflexes in catching Bond's shoe, and Le Chiffre's discovery of the fountain pen. The use of words like "lightning," "whistle of pain," and "crashed to the ground" creates a sense of urgency and intensity, keeping the reader on edge and wondering what will happen next. The passage effectively builds suspense and creates a sense of danger, making it extremely suspenseful.
