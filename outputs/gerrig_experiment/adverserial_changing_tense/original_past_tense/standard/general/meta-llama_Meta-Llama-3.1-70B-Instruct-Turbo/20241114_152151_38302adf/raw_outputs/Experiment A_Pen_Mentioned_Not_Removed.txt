***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 5: Moderately likely. Although Bond has managed to attempt a brief escape and has moved his fountain pen (which could potentially be used as a tool) to a safer location, he is currently being held at gunpoint and has been disarmed. However, Bond's resourcefulness and agility are demonstrated in the passage, suggesting that he might be able to find an opportunity to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of urgency and tension, with Bond attempting to escape and being thwarted by the Corsican. The use of action verbs like "hurled", "slammed", and "twisted" adds to the sense of intensity and danger. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being held at gunpoint and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of vulnerability and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
