Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, the fact that Bond was able to momentarily gain the upper hand earlier in the passage (by pulling the rug and causing Blofeld to stumble) suggests that he is resourceful and capable of finding ways to escape. Additionally, Bond's character is known for his ability to get out of tight spots, so it's likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "painfully" twisting piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and danger. The fact that Blofeld has left Bond alone with Crushak, a menacing and ugly character, also increases the sense of suspense and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen to him
