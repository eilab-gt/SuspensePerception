***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his cunning and ability to escape from tight spots.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense from the start, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the wall adds to the sense of unpredictability, and the subsequent events, including the introduction of the menacing Mr. Crushak, only increase the sense of danger and suspense. The description of Bond being tied up with piano wire and the threat of Crushak's devotion to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
