Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it's unlikely that he will escape easily. He's been disarmed and pinned down, and it seems that Le Chiffre has the upper hand.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation, with Bond being captured and disarmed, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "he righted himself with minimal damage", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what will happen to Bond and Vesper.
