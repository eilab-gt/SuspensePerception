Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a difficult situation, having been caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He is being searched and disarmed, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashed to the ground", and "trained on Bond's unquiet chest" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage also builds suspense by creating a sense of uncertainty about what will happen next, and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
