Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the use of phrases such as "the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "Bond crashed to the ground" creates a sense of urgency and action. The fact that Bond is being held captive and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his henchmen also adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen to him next.
