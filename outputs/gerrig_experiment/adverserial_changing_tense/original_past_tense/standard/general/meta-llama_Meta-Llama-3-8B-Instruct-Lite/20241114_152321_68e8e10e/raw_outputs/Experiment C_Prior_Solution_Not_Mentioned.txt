Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, with his arms pinned to the chair using piano wire. This makes it seem unlikely that he will escape on his own.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a situation where the protagonist, James Bond, is in a precarious and dangerous situation, being held captive by a villainous character and his henchman. The use of words like "distraction", "gun", "dark", and "painfully" creates a sense of tension and danger, making the reader feel uneasy and worried about Bond's fate. The description of Bond's physical discomfort and the menacing tone of Blofeld and Crushak also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
