**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is now a prisoner, tied up and guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak, who has orders to shoot him if he tries to speak to him.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful, as it describes Bond's capture and the dire circumstances he is in. The use of phrases such as "pointing a gun at you", "devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life", and "orders to shoot you if you even attempt to speak to him" creates a sense of tension and danger, making the reader feel that Bond's situation is precarious and that he may not survive. The dark and ominous tone of the passage also adds to the suspense, making it a very suspenseful passage.
