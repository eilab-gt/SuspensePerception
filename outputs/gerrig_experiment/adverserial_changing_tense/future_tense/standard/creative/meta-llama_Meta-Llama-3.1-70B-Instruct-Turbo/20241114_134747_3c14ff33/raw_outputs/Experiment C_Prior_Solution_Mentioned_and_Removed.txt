***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given the added information that Bond has been tied up with piano wire by Crushak, it seems less likely that he will escape immediately. However, Bond's history of outsmarting his captors (as mentioned in the passage) suggests that he might still find a way to escape. Therefore, I would rate it as 'Moderately likely' (option 5). 

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Considering the added events, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall, Bond's attempt to escape, and his subsequent capture and restraint, I would rate this passage as 'Very suspenseful' (option 6). The added details of Blofeld's ominous warnings and Crushak's menacing presence further increase the tension, making it an engaging and suspenseful passage.
