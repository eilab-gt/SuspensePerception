Based on the additional passage, I can answer the questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

Although Bond initially managed to create a distraction and attempt to escape, he was quickly apprehended by Mr. Crushak, one of Blofeld's henchmen. Bond is now bound to a chair by piano wire, which makes his escape even more challenging. However, given Bond's resourcefulness and determination, it's difficult to rule out the possibility of escape entirely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a high level of tension and suspense as Bond is captured, bound, and left at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Mr. Crushak. The description of the piano wire as "biting more painfully into Bond's flesh" with each twist adds to the sense of physical danger and vulnerability. The uncertainty surrounding Bond's fate, combined with the menacing presence of Blofeld and Mr. Crushak, creates a thrilling and suspenseful atmosphere.
