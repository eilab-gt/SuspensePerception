***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
6. Very likely

This response is based on the genre of the novel, the protagonist's character, and the conventions of the spy thriller. Despite the fact that Bond is currently a prisoner and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, the reader can reasonably expect that the main character of a spy novel will find a way to escape from such situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

This response is based on the description of the tense and violent action in the passage, the fact that Bond's life is in danger, and the ominous tone established by Le Chiffre's character. The passage builds tension through the use of sudden, violent movements (e.g., Bond's backward kick, the Corsican's quick reaction), and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next.
