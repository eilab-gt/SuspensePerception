***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up by Crushak and under the threat of being shot, it is a characteristic of James Bond to escape from seemingly impossible situations. Given the context of the novel and the genre of spy Bond books, it is very likely that Bond will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the description of Bond's predicament, the menacing presence of Crushak, and Blofeld's cold and calculating demeanor. The use of vivid imagery, such as the contortion of Crushak's face into a smile, adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being tied up and threatened with death creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
