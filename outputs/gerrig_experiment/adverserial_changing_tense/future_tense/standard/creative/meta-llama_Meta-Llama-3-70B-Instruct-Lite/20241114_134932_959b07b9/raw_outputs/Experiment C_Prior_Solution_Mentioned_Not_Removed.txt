I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage, but please note that the passage is not the original excerpt from Ian Fleming's novel, but rather a continuation of the story.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has managed to create a distraction and make a brief attempt to escape, he was quickly apprehended by Crushak. The passage doesn't provide a clear indication of Bond's chances of escape, leaving the outcome uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through Bond's attempted escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the ominous tone set by Blofeld's dialogue. The description of Crushak's actions, such as contorting his face into a "smile" and tightly wrapping piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of unease and danger.
