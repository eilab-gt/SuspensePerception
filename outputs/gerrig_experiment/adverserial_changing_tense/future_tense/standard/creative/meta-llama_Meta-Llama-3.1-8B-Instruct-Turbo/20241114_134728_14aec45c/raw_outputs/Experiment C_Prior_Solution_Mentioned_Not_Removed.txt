**Answer to Question 1:**
Given the information provided, Bond's chances of escaping from Blofeld seem unlikely, as he is physically restrained by piano wire, tied to a chair. Additionally, Crushak, a large and menacing man, is also present to prevent Bond from escaping. The statement made by Blofeld about his guard who died in an automobile accident also suggests that Blofeld takes revenge against those who fail him, increasing the danger for Bond.

**Answer: 1. Not very likely**

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is highly suspenseful due to the description of Blofeld's trap for Bond, the confrontations between Blofeld and Bond, and the violent and menacing actions of Crushak. The use of detailed descriptions of Bond's physical discomfort and pain from the wire, as well as the dark and tense atmosphere in the room, contributes to the suspenseful tone of the passage. The reader is left with a sense of unease, wondering what will happen next to Bond.

**Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful**
