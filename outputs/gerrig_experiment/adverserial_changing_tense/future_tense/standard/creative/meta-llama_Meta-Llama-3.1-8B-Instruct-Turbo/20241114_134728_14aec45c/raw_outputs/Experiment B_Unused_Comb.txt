***Answer to Question 1:***
Given the situation, it is not looking good for Bond. He has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and has been thoroughly searched, with his revolver being taken away. His trusty pocket comb has also been found, which he relies on for its potential hidden knife blade. Bond is now helpless and at Le Chiffre's mercy, feeling "puny and impotent." Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is: 1. Not very likely

***Answer to Question 2:***
This passage is quite suspenseful as it builds on the prior events described in the initial passage. It creates a sense of tension and raises the stakes, making the reader question what will happen next to Bond. Additionally, the plot twist of Le Chiffre returning to capture Bond, along with the detailed descriptions of the action and Bond's predicament, adds to the suspense.
