**Answer to Question 1:** Given that Bond has just been overpowered by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have been able to disarm him, it's likely that Bond is currently in a difficult situation. His efforts to escape from the room failed as he was outmaneuvered and outnumbered. Considering these factors, the likelihood of him escaping from Le Chiffre at the moment is low. 

**Answer to Question 2:** This passage is quite suspenseful. The quick turn of events, where Bond's confidence and initial success are suddenly reversed by Le Chiffre's trap, adds to the suspense. The descriptions of the violent and efficient actions of Le Chiffre's men further contribute to the tension. It appears that Bond is in a precarious situation, which adds to the suspensefulness of the passage.
