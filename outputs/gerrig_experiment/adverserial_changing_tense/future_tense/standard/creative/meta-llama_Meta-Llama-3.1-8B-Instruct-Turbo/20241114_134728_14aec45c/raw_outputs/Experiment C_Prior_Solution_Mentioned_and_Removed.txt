**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that the situation is not in Bond's favor. He has been captured by Blofeld and is currently tied down to a chair with piano wire, which is not only restricting his movement but also causing him pain. Additionally, he is threatened with being shot by a formidable and seemingly devoted henchman. Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as **1. Not very likely** at this point.

**Answer to Question 2:**
Given the tense and ominous atmosphere of the passage, with Bond being captured and threatened, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as **7. Extremely suspenseful**. The description of the setting, the actions of the characters, and the increasing tension all contribute to a high level of suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next and whether Bond will manage to escape or face dire consequences.
