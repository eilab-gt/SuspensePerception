Given the situation described, I will answer Question 1:

1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches at this point. He is already a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunman, Crushak. The text describes Crushak carefully pinning Bond in place, which makes it seem like a secure and difficult situation for Bond to escape from.

Now, I will answer Question 2:

5. Moderately suspenseful

This passage has some suspenseful elements, as it describes Bond in a precarious situation where he is captured and tied up by a strong and menacing individual. However, the passage does not have a lot of unexpected twists or revelations, and Bond's capture seems to be a predictable outcome given the circumstances. The suspense level is moderately high, as it leaves the reader wondering what will happen next, but it's not extremely high, as the situation is somewhat predetermined.
