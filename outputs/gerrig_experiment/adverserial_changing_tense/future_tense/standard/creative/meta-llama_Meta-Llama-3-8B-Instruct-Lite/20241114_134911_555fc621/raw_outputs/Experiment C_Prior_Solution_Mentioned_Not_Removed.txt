**Answer 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
I would rate this a 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and it seems that Blofeld has a clear plan to keep him that way. The description of Bond being tied up in a chair with piano wire suggests that he will not be able to escape easily.

**Answer 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
I would rate this a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with ominous and threatening language, from Blofeld's words to the actions of Crushak. The image of Bond being tied up with piano wire is particularly unsettling, and the sense of danger and imprisonment is palpable. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not. The use of vivid and evocative language, such as "large and ugly" and "contort his face into what he might have intended as a smile", adds to the suspense and tension.
