Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his henchmen, and is being disarmed and searched. This does not seem to be a favorable situation for Bond's escape, so it is unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of the events unfolding is fast-paced and intense. The use of phrases such as "Like lightning the Corsican will slam himself back against the wall of the passage" and "the Corsican will very quickly, but somehow delicately, shoot out his left hand, catch Bond's shoe at the top of its arc, and twist it sharply" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
