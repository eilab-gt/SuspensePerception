Answering Question 1:

* How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?
I would choose answer 1. Not very likely.

Bond is trapped by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and despite his initial efforts to defend himself, he is unable to escape or overpower his captors. It seems unlikely that he will escape from his predicament at this point in the story.

Answering Question 2:

* How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful.

The passage is filled with tension and suspense as Bond is suddenly ambushed by the three men, and his efforts to defend himself are foiled. The use of words like "burst in", "guns drawn", "crash to the ground", and "feel puny and impotent" creates a sense of danger and vulnerability, making the passage very suspenseful. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape his predicament.
