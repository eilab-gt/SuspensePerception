Answering the questions:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**
I would choose: 1. Not very likely

Given the circumstances, it seems that Bond is at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and is being restrained and tied up in a chair. The tone of the passage suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim, and that he will have to rely on his wits to try and outsmart his captors.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
I would choose: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with suspenseful elements, such as the sudden interruption of the scene by the bird, the danger of being shot, the feeling of being trapped and helpless, and the looming threat of death at the hands of Crushak. The description of Bond's physical discomfort and the increasing tension in the scene all contribute to a sense of high tension and suspense.
