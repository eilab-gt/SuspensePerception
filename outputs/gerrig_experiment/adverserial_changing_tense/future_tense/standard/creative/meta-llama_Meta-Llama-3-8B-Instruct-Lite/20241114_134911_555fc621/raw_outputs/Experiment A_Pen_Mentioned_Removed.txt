**Answer 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned, and is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. While Bond is able to perform some impressive physical feats, such as kicking the thin man's shins and twisting out of his shoe, he is ultimately caught and disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation without assistance.

**Answer 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and urgency through the description of Bond's actions and the outcome of those actions. The reader is left wondering whether Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's trap, and whether he will be able to get away from the two gunmen. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican will slam himself back against the wall of the passage" and "Bond will roll agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket", adds
