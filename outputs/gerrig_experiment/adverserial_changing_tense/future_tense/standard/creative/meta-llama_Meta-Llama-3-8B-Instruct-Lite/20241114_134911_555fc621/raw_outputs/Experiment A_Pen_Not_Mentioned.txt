Answer 1: I would choose option 1. "Not very likely". It seems that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned, and he's already been caught off guard by Le Chiffre's trap. He's also described as being brought to his feet and roughly searched, which suggests that he's not in a strong position to escape.

Answer 2: I would choose option 6. "Very suspenseful". The passage is building tension and raising the stakes, with Bond's situation becoming increasingly dire. The vivid descriptions of the action and the characters' movements create a sense of urgency and danger, making it clear that Bond is in a precarious position. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "crash to the ground", and "trained on Bond's unquiet chest" also add to the suspense and create a sense of foreboding.
