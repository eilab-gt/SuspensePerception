Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been caught and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but Bond is a skilled agent and has shown resourcefulness in the past. The outcome is uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering if he will escape or be harmed. The use of action-packed descriptions, such as Bond's attempted escape and the Corsican's quick reflexes, adds to the suspense. The passage also raises questions about what will happen next, keeping the reader engaged and curious.
