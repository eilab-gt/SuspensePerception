***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, Bond's history of escaping from tight spots and his resourcefulness suggest that he will find a way to escape. The passage sets up a classic Bond scenario, with Bond as the prisoner and Blofeld as the villain, and it's likely that Bond will use his skills and cunning to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it sets up a tense situation where Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, making the passage very suspenseful.
