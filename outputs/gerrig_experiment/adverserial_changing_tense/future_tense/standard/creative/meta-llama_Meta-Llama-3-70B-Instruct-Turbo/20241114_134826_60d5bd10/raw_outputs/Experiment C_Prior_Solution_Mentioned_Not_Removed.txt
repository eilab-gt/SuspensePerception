My answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the sound of the bird crashing into the glass wall, the darkness of the office, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, creates a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from this situation, which adds to the suspense.
