Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a dire situation for Bond, with him being trapped and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond's agility and quick thinking are shown in his attempt to defend himself, which suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve. Therefore, it's difficult to say for certain whether Bond will escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by suddenly turning the tables on Bond, who has just defeated Le Chiffre. The sudden burst of violence, the rough handling of Bond, and the menacing tone of Le Chiffre all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next, which creates a strong sense of suspense.
