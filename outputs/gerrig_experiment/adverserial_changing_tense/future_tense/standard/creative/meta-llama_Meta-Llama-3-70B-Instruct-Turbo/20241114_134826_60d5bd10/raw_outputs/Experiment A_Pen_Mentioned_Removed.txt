Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't give away whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond tries to make a move to rescue Vesper, he is quickly caught and disarmed by Le Chiffre's men. However, Bond's ability to move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket without being noticed suggests that he might still have a plan up his sleeve.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, and Le Chiffre's men are in control. The sudden and swift action, such as Bond's attempt to escape and the Corsican's quick reflexes, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or outsmart his captors.
