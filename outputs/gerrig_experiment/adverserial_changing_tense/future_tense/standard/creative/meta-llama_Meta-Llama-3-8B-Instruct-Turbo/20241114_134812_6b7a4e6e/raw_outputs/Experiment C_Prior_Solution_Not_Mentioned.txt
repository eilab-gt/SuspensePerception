Answering the questions based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. Bond is tied up in a chair, and Crushak seems to be a formidable and menacing figure. It appears that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and anticipation. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The introduction of the bird crashing into the wall, the sudden darkness, and the appearance of the large and ugly Crushak all contribute to a sense of suspense and unease. The passage builds a sense of claustrophobia and danger, making it very suspenseful.
