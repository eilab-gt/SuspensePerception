Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given the situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and pinned down by Blofeld's gunmen, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches. He is physically restrained and faces the threat of death if he tries to speak to the guard, Crushak. This makes it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape or outwit his captors.
