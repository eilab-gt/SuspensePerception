Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are currently trapped, with Bond's arms pinned by piano wire and a large, ugly man standing guard. Blofeld has already mentioned that he is not amused by Bond's antics and has stated his intention to eliminate Bond. Given their current situation, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's clear that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, and the tension is building. The unexpected arrival of the bird, the sudden darkness, and the appearance of Crushak all add to the sense of urgency and danger. The graphic description of Bond's arms being pinned by piano wire and the mention of Crushak's intention to eliminate Bond create a sense of dread and foreboding, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
