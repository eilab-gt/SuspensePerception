Answer to Question 1: 1st option - Not very likely

Bond is outnumbered and outgunned, and Le Chiffre seems to have the upper hand. He is being held at gunpoint, and his plans to cause damage to the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper are being foiled. It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Answer to Question 2: 6th option - Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held captive, and the reader is aware that he is in a desperate situation. The passage is filled with action, violence, and the threat of harm, which keeps the reader on edge. The use of descriptive language, such as "the Corsican will slam himself back against the wall of the passage", "he will very quickly, but somehow delicately, shoot out his left hand", and "he will crash to the ground" creates a sense of realism and heightens the suspense.
