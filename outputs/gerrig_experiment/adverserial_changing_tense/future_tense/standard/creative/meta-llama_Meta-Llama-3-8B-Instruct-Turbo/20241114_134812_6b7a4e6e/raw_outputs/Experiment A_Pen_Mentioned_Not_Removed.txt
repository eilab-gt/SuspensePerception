***Answer to Question 1:***
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond has been captured and is being searched by Le Chiffre's associates, and Le Chiffre himself is observing the situation. This suggests that Bond's immediate chances of escape are low. He may still find opportunities to escape later, but for now, he is in a precarious situation.
