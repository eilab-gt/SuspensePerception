***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and tied up, the passage doesn't convey a sense of hopelessness. Bond has already shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall. Additionally, Bond's character is known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, so it's likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's precarious situation, including the guns pointed at him, the physical restraint, and the ominous tone of Blofeld's dialogue. The use of vivid details, such as the contorted face of Mr. Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this dangerous situation.
