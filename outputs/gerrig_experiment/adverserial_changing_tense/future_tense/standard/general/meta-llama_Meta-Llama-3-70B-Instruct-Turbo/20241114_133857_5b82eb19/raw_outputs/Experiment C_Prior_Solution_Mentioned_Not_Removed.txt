***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful secret agent, and it's unlikely that Ian Fleming would allow his protagonist to be captured and defeated so easily. Bond has already demonstrated his ability to outwit Blofeld's guards in the past, and it's likely that he will find a way to escape from his current predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's precarious situation, trapped and helpless in the chair, with Blofeld and his menacing henchman Crushak looming over him. The use of vivid details, such as the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this situation, which creates a sense of suspense and anticipation.
