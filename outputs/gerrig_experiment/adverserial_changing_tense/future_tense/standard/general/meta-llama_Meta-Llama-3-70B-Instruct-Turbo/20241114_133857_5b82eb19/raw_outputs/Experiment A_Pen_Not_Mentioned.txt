Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage shows Bond being captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. While Bond tries to resist and escape, he is ultimately overpowered and at the mercy of his captors. However, the passage does not provide enough information to determine whether Bond will ultimately escape or not. It is possible that Bond may find a way to escape, but it is also possible that he may not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and action-packed scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of words like "lightning", "whistle", and "crash" creates a sense of urgency and danger, and the fact that Bond is overpowered and at the mercy of his captors adds to the suspense. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, which adds to the suspense.
