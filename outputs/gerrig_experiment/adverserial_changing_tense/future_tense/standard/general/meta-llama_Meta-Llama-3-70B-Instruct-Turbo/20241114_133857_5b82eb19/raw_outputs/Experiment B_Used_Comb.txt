***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being trapped and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his cunning and ability to escape from tight spots. Therefore, it's difficult to say for certain whether Bond will escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and urgency. Bond is caught off guard and trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he will get out of this situation. The use of words like "burst", "leap", "guns drawn", and "roughly strip" creates a sense of intensity and raises the stakes. The fact that Bond is feeling "puny and impotent" adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
