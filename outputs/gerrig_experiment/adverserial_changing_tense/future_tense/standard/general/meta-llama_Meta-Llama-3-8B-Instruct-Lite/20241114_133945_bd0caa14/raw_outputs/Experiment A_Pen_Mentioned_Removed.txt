Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it's unlikely that he will escape easily. He's being overpowered and disarmed, and Le Chiffre seems to be in control.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and that the outcome is uncertain. The use of descriptive language, such as "whistle of pain" and "crash to the ground", adds to the sense of drama and suspense. The reader is on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
