Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained by piano wire. It seems unlikely that he will escape from this situation without some kind of outside intervention or clever thinking on his part.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being restrained, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid and ominous descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, adds to the sense of foreboding and unease. The reader is left with a sense of concern for Bond's safety and is eager to find out what will happen to him next.
