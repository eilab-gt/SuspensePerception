Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his henchmen, and it seems unlikely that he will escape from their clutches. He is being searched, disarmed, and is at the mercy of his captors.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation and that he is being overpowered by his captors. The use of words like "slam", "whistle of pain", "crash", and "brusquely" creates a sense of urgency and violence, making the reader feel on edge and eager to know what will happen next. The fact that Bond is being searched and disarmed, and that Le Chiffre is watching him with an air of superiority, adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
