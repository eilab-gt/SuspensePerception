Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It is unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, as they have him trapped and have already disarmed him of his revolver. Bond's attempts to fight back have been unsuccessful, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden and unexpected entry of the gunmen, the physical struggle between Bond and the gunmen, and the feeling of Bond's impotence and vulnerability all contribute to a sense of suspense and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape or not.
