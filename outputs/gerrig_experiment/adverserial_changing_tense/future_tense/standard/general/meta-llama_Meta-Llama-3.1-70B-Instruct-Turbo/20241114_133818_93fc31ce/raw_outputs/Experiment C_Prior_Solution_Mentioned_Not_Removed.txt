***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given the additional context provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 6. Very likely. This is because Bond has a history of escaping from captivity, as mentioned by Blofeld himself, and the passage sets up a scenario where Bond is already thinking on his feet and looking for opportunities to escape. Additionally, the James Bond series is known for its protagonist's ability to get out of seemingly impossible situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of piano wire to restrain Bond adds to the sense of danger and vulnerability, and the fact that Bond has a history of escaping from captivity raises the stakes and creates anticipation for how he will manage to escape this time. The passage effectively builds suspense and tension, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.
