***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering Bond's past experiences and his resourceful nature, I would say that it's still very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. The passage doesn't provide any conclusive evidence that would suggest Bond's situation is hopeless. In fact, the additional details only reinforce the idea that Bond has been in tough spots before and has managed to escape.

Answer: 6. Very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is extremely suspenseful. It creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of danger and discomfort. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak to him raises the stakes and creates a sense of desperation.

Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful
