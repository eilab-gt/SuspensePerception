***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Considering the situation, I would say that it's "Not very likely" (Option 1). Bond is currently trapped, unarmed, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Although Bond has shown some agility and quick thinking in the past, his current situation seems dire, making escape unlikely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would rate this passage as "Extremely suspenseful" (Option 7). The sudden and violent turn of events, with Bond being ambushed and overpowered, creates a sense of tension and urgency. The fact that Bond is now a prisoner, feeling "puny and impotent," raises concerns for his safety and well-being, making the reader wonder what will happen next and how Bond will manage to escape.
