***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would say 2. Somewhat likely. Although Bond is currently a prisoner, he has already shown his resourcefulness and quick thinking by attempting to escape and trying to move his fountain pen (which might be a useful tool) into a safer position. This suggests that Bond is not one to give up easily, and he might still find a way to escape or turn the situation around.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would say 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Bond's silent summons, his sudden decision to escape, and the violent confrontation with the Corsican. The fact that Bond is trying to protect Vesper and himself from Le Chiffre's henchmen creates a sense of urgency and danger. Additionally, the passage raises questions about what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape, which adds to the suspense.
