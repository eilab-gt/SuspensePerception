***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been caught by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, and is now being tied up in a chair. The fact that he's being left with Crushak to "contemplate his rude behavior" suggests that his escape is unlikely at this point. Therefore, the answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The use of vivid and unsettling descriptions, such as the image of Crushak's ugly face and the painful twisting of the piano wire, creates a sense of unease and raises the stakes for Bond's situation. The passage also implies that Bond is in a precarious and potentially life-threatening situation, which adds to the suspense. Therefore, the answer is:

6. Very suspenseful
