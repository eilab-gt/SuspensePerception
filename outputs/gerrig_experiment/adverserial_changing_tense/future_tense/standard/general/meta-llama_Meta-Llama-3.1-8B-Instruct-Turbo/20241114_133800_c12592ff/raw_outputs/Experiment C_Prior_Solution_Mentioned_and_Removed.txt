***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. He is being held captive by two heavily armed men, one of whom is a large and ugly man named Crushak who is specifically tasked with eliminating Bond if he tries to escape or speak to him. Additionally, Bond is physically restrained by piano wire, making it difficult for him to move or escape. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and potentially deadly situation where Bond is being held captive by a villainous character and his henchman. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as the image of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the painful twisting of piano wire around Bond's arms, creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being threatened with death if he tries to speak to Crushak adds to the sense of danger and suspense. Therefore, the correct answer is:

6. Very suspenseful
