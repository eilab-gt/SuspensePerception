**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has a plan to escape and cause damage to the gunmen, but it is not entirely clear how successful his plan will be. He is able to avoid some of the gunshots and manage to move his pen to a safer location, but the Corsican will be keeping a close eye on him. Given these factors, I would say that Bond's chances of escape are somewhat uncertain.

However, considering the information provided, the best answer would be: **4. Neutral or Uncertain**

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense situation where Bond is trying to escape from the clutches of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The use of action verbs like "slam", "thrust", "crash", and "twist" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen to him next. Therefore, I would say that the passage is **6. Very suspenseful**.
