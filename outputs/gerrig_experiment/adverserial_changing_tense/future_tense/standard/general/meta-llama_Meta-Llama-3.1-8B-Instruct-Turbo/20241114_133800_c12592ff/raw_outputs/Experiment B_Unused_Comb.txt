Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

This answer is based on the fact that Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have successfully disarmed him. Bond is described as feeling "puny and impotent," which suggests that he is at a disadvantage.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This answer is based on the sudden and unexpected turn of events in the passage. The reader is initially led to believe that Bond has successfully defeated Le Chiffre, but then Le Chiffre and his men burst into the room and overpower Bond. The use of action-packed language, such as "the door will burst in toward him" and "he will crash to the ground," creates a sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from this predicament, making the passage very suspenseful.
