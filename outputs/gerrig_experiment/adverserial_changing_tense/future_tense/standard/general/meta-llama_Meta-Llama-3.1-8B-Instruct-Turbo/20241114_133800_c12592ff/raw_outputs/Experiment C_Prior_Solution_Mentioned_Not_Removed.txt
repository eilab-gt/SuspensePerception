Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is being held captive by Blofeld and his large and formidable gunman, Crushak. The fact that Crushak is described as "devoted to eliminating irritations" from Blofeld's life implies that he will not hesitate to use violence to keep Bond from escaping. Additionally, the fact that Bond is tied up with piano wire and Crushak is guarding him suggests that escape is unlikely at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden interruption by the bird, the unexpected twist of events, and the ominous presence of Crushak all contribute to a sense of suspense. The passage also creates a sense of foreboding, as Bond is being held captive and is at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak. The dark and ominous tone of the passage, as well as the use of vivid and unsettling imagery (e.g. the description of Crushak's ugly face), adds to
