Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond's plan to escape is foiled by the Corsican's quick action, as he catches Bond's shoe and twists it sharply, causing Bond to crash to the ground. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of words like "like lightning", "slam", and "crash" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like something is about to go wrong. The fact that Bond's plan is foiled and he is caught by the Corsican adds to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
