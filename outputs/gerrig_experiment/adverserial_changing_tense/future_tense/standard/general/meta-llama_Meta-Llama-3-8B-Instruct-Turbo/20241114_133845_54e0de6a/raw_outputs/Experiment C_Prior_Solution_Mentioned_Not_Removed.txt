Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair, and the situation seems quite dire. The fact that Bond's previous attempts to escape were unsuccessful (as mentioned by Blofeld) also suggests that his chances of escape are low.

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond trapped and helpless against Blofeld's men. The use of vivid details, such as the description of Crushak's ugly face and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The passage also builds anticipation and expectation, making the reader wonder what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
