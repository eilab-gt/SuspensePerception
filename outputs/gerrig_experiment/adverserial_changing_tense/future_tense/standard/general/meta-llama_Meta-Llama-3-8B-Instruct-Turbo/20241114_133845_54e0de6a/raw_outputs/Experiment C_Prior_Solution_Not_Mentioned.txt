Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and is being restrained by piano wire and forced to sit in a chair.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes Bond being trapped and helpless, with no clear way for him to escape. The tension builds as Bond is forced to sit in the chair, and the description of Crushak's ugly face and Blofeld's cold demeanor adds to the sense of unease. The use of vivid language, such as "the large and very ugly man" and "the piece of piano wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere.
