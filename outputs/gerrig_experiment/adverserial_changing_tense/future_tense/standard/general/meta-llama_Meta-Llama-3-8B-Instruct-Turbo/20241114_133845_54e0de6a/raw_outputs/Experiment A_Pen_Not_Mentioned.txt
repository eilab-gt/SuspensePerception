Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and outgunned, and Bond has already been injured and disarmed.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of the events unfolding creates a sense of urgency and unpredictability. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistle of pain", adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
