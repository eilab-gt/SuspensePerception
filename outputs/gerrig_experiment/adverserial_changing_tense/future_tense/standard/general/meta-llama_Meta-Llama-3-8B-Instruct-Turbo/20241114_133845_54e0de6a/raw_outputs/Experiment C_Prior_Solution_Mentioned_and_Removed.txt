Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The description of the events, including the bird crashing into the wall, the darkness, and the physical pain inflicted on Bond, creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Bond's escape. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to find a way to escape or if he will be captured and killed.
