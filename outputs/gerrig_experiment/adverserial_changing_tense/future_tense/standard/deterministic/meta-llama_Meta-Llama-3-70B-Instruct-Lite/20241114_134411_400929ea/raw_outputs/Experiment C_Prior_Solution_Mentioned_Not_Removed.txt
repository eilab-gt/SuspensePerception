***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it would be out of character for him to be easily defeated by Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The description of the wire being twisted around Bond's arms, biting into his flesh, adds to the sense of discomfort and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this precarious situation.
