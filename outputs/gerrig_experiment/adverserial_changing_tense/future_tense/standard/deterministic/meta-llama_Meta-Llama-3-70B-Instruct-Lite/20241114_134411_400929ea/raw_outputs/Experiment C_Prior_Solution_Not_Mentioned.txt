I would answer: 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being a skilled secret agent, it's likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the painful wire binding Bond's arms, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next.
