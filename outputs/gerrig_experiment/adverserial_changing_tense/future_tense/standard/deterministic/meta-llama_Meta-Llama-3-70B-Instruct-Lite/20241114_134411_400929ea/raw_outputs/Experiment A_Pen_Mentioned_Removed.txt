***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, so it's hard to predict the outcome. Bond has already shown some resourcefulness, but he's currently at a disadvantage.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond in a dangerous situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "spidery summons" and the "whistle of pain", adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
