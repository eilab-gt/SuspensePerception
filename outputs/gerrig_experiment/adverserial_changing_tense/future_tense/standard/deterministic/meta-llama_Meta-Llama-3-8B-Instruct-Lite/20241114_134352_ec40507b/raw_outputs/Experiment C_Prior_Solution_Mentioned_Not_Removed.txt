Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained with piano wire. This makes it unlikely that he will escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is trapped and being held captive by a villainous character. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as "pointing a gun at you", "devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life", and "bite more painfully into Bond's flesh", creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or not.
