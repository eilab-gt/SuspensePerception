Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and it seems that he is being restrained and prepared for a potentially unpleasant fate. The situation is dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will escape from this predicament without some kind of intervention or clever thinking on his part.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of his capture and restraint is vivid and unsettling. The use of words like "gun", "painfully", and "contemplate" adds to the sense of foreboding, making the reader feel that something terrible is about to happen to Bond. The passage is also well-paced, with a sense of escalating danger and tension that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
