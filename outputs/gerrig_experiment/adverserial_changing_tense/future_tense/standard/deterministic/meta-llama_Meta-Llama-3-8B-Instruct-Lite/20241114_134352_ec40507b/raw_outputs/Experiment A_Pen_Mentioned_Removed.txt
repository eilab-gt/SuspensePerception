Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and is at the mercy of their actions. The fact that Le Chiffre has taken away Bond's fountain pen, which Bond had hoped to use as a weapon, further reduces the likelihood of Bond's escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is at risk of being harmed or killed. The use of words like "slam", "whistle of pain", "shoot out his left hand", and "brusquely" creates a sense of urgency and intensity, making the reader feel like they are experiencing the events alongside Bond. The passage also raises questions about what will happen next, such as whether Bond will be able to escape or if Le Chiffre will carry out his plans, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.
