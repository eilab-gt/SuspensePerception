Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained with piano wire. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that he will escape without some kind of clever thinking or action.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of the events that unfold is vivid and intense. The use of words like "gun", "pointing at his chest", "eliminating", and "shoot you if you even attempt to speak to him" creates a sense of urgency and fear, making the reader feel on edge and eager to know what will happen next.
