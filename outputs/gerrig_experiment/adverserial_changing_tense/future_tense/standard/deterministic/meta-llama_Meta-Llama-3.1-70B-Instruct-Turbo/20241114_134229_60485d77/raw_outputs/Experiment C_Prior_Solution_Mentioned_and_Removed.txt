***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and the passage itself sets up a situation where Bond has already attempted to escape once and is now being held captive again. The fact that Blofeld mentions Bond's previous escape and takes extra precautions to prevent it from happening again suggests that Bond is a formidable opponent who is capable of escaping. Additionally, the passage does not provide any information that would suggest Bond's situation is hopeless, leaving room for a potential escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and ominous atmosphere, with Bond being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of danger and discomfort. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak also raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency. Furthermore
