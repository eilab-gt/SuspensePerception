***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 2. Somewhat likely

Although Bond has been caught and disarmed, he has shown his resourcefulness and agility in attempting to escape and fight back. However, he is currently at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, which makes his chances of escape uncertain. Given Bond's character and the genre of the novel, it's likely that he will find a way to escape, but the passage doesn't provide enough information to make it extremely likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of action, tension, and suspense. Bond's attempt to escape and his subsequent capture create a sense of urgency and danger. The description of the Corsican's quick and delicate movement to catch Bond's shoe and the rough handling of Bond by the gunmen adds to the tension. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre, who seems to be enjoying the situation, creates a sense of foreboding and raises questions about what will happen next
