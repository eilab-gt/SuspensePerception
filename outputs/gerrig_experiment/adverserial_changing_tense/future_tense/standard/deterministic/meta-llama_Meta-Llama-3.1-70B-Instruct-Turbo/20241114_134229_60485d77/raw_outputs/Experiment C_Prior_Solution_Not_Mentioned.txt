***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and the passage itself shows him attempting to escape and causing a distraction. Although he is currently tied up, it's likely that he will find a way to escape or be rescued, given his character's history and abilities.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and urgency. The fact that Bond is currently unable to escape and is being left to "contemplate his rude behavior" creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about what will happen next, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
