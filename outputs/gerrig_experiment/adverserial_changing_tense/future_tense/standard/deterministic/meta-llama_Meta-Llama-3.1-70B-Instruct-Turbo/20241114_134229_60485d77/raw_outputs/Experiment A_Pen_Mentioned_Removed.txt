***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 2. Somewhat likely

Although Bond has been caught and disarmed, he is still resourceful and agile, as shown by his attempt to escape and his quick thinking in moving his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket. This suggests that Bond may still have a plan or a trick up his sleeve, making his escape somewhat likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, such as Bond's sudden decision to escape, the Corsican's quick reflexes in catching Bond's shoe, and Le Chiffre's attentive observation of Bond's movements. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "like lightning", and "roughly strip" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful. The fact that Bond's plan is not fully revealed and that Le Chiffre seems to be one step ahead of him adds to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
