***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the passage, I would answer: 2. Somewhat likely

Although Bond has been caught off guard and is currently trapped, his agility and quick thinking in the initial confrontation suggest that he might still find a way to escape. However, the fact that he is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and has been disarmed, makes his situation precarious.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's sudden and unexpected capture, his initial attempt to defend himself, and his subsequent helplessness. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of his enemy, and the ominous tone of Le Chiffre's words, contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next, and whether he will be able to escape his predicament.
