***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and the passage itself hints at his ability to think on his feet and take advantage of distractions (as seen in the initial bird crashing into the glass wall). Although he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak, it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape or turn the situation to his advantage.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage effectively creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Bond's survival. The passage also sets up a sense of anticipation, leaving the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this precarious situation
