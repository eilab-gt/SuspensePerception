***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond has been caught off guard and is currently trapped, he has shown resourcefulness and agility in his initial reaction to the attack. Additionally, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's likely that he will find a way to escape or turn the situation around.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond being caught off guard and overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. The use of action-packed language, such as "the door will burst in toward him" and "Bond will suddenly whirl around," adds to the suspense. The fact that Bond is trapped and feeling "puny and impotent" also raises the stakes and creates a sense of uncertainty, making the reader wonder how Bond will manage to escape.
