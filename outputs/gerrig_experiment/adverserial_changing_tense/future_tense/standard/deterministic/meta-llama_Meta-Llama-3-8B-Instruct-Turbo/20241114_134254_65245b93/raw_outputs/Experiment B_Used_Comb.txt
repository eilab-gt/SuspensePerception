Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, given that they have him trapped and have disarmed him. Bond's attempts to defend himself, such as shoving one of the gunmen with his heel, are unsuccessful, and he is left feeling "puny and impotent".

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden burst of the door and the appearance of the three large men with guns drawn is a shocking and intense moment. The fact that Bond is unable to defend himself and is left feeling trapped and helpless adds to the suspense. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors.
