Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, given that he is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Le Chiffre has already taken away Bond's revolver and fountain pen. Bond's attempts to escape, such as his plan to do damage to the gunmen, seem to be foiled by the Corsican's quick reflexes and Le Chiffre's attention to detail.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and that Le Chiffre and his henchmen are determined to keep him captive.
