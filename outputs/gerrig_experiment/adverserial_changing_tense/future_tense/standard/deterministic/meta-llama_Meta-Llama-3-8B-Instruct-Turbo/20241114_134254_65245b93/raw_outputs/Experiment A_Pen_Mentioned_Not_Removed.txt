Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been caught off guard and is being searched for any hidden weapons. Given his current circumstances, it's unlikely that he will be able to escape easily.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and that he may not be able to escape. The use of vivid language, such as "slam himself back against the wall", "whistle of pain", and "crash to the ground", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is also left wondering what will happen next, which keeps them engaged and curious.
