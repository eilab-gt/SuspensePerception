Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped in Blofeld's office with no clear escape route. He's been caught off guard and is now being restrained by Crushak. The odds are against him, and it's unlikely that he'll be able to escape without a clever plan or a bit of luck.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he'll manage to escape. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what will happen next.
