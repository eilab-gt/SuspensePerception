***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has a plan to escape, but it's not clear if it will be successful. He is able to dodge the Corsican's shot and roll to the ground, but he is then caught by the two gunmen and disarmed. Le Chiffre seems to be in control, and Bond's plan is foiled. Therefore, I would say that it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer: 1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and action-packed scene where Bond is trying to escape from his captors. The use of words like "like lightning" and "whistle of pain" creates a sense of urgency and intensity. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape and what will happen next. The passage also raises questions about the outcome of Bond's plan and whether he will be able to outsmart Le Chiffre and his men. Therefore, I would say that this passage is very suspenseful
