**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being caught off guard by Le Chiffre and his men, and despite his agility and quick thinking, he is unable to escape. The fact that he is searched, his revolver is taken, and his comb is used against him suggests that he is at a disadvantage and unlikely to escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
Based on the passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is caught off guard and outmaneuvered by Le Chiffre and his men. The use of action verbs like "burst in," "leap through," "shove," "twist," and "crash" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like something is about to go wrong. The description of Bond's feelings of "puny and impotence" adds to the sense of suspense and raises questions about how he will escape from this situation.
