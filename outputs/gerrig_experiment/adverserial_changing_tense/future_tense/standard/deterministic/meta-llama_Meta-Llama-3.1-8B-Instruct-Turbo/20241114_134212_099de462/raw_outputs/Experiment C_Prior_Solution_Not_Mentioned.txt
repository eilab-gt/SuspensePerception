**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He has been caught by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, and is being restrained with piano wire. While Bond is able to take advantage of a distraction to try to escape, he is ultimately met with another obstacle, and his escape is thwarted. Therefore, I would say that it is **Not very likely** that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being held captive by a villainous character and his henchman. The use of vivid and detailed descriptions of the setting and the actions of the characters creates a sense of tension and foreboding. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being restrained and threatened by a large and ugly henchman adds to the sense of danger and suspense. Therefore, I would say that this passage is **Extremely suspenseful**.
