"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, with two gunmen (Blofeld and Crushak) holding him captive. The fact that Crushak has tied Bond up with piano wire, which is twisted painfully into his flesh, makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape easily.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"large bird crashing into the wall of glass\" and the \"ugly man\" with a contorted face, adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The passage also raises questions about Bond"
