To answer the questions, I will first decipher the Caesar ciphered text with a step of 7.

Deciphered text:

Jimmy Bond was sitting at a table in a crowded casino. He had been assigned to ruin a criminal figure named Le Chiffre by causing him to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. Along the way, Bond had acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond had, in fact, brought about the gambling losses, Le Chiffre had laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper were now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen.

Now, I will answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer 1. Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which makes it difficult for them to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The reader is left
