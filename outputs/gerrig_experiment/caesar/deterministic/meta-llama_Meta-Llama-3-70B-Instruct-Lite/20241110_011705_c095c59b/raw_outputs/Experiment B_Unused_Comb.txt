To answer the questions, I'll first decipher the excerpt using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7.

After deciphering, the excerpt reads:

Bond's eyes were on his watch. He had been caught, and he knew that he was beaten. The sweat was running down his face and his body was trembling with the effort of holding out. He was beaten and he knew it, and the thought of the torture that was to come was almost unbearable.

Vesper's eyes were on his, and she knew that he knew. She knew that he was beaten, and she was waiting for him to make the final gesture of defeat. The men were coming closer, their faces set with a cruel intent.

Bond's mind was a jumble of thoughts, but one thought dominated all the others - the thought of the pain that was to come. He was a gambler, and he had gambled and lost. The knowledge of his defeat was bitter, and the thought of the pain that was to come was a nightmare.

"It's all right," Bond said.

Vesper's eyes never left his, and Bond knew that she knew. She knew that he was beaten, and she was waiting for him to make the final gesture of defeat.
