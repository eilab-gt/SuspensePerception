Deciphered excerpt:

Bond's eyes were closed, and he was breathing heavily. The sweat was running down his face, and his body was trembling with the effort of trying to break the ropes.

Le Chiffre was sitting in a chair, his eyes fixed on Bond, a thin smile on his face.

"Well, well, well," Le Chiffre said. "You are a stubborn man, Mr. Bond. You are a very stubborn man."

Bond's eyes flickered open, and he looked up at Le Chiffre. His voice was low and even. "You're a very clever man, Le Chiffre," he said. "But you're not clever enough."
