To answer the questions, I'll first decipher the excerpt using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7.

Deciphered excerpt:

Bond's eyes were closed, and he was breathing heavily. The sweat was running down his face. He was lying on the wooden floor, his wrists and ankles bound with thick cord. Vesper was beside him, her eyes closed, her face pale. Le Chiffre's two gunmen stood over them, their guns trained on Bond's head. The door was locked and the windows were barred. There was no escape.

Le Chiffre's voice was low and urgent. "You are a fool, Mr. Bond," he said. "You are a fool to have trusted me. Now you will pay the price."

Bond's eyes flickered open. He looked up at Le Chiffre, and then at the gunmen. He looked at Vesper, and his eyes were filled with a deep sadness. "You shouldn't have played cards with me, Vesper," he said. "I'm afraid it's all over."

Now, to answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
