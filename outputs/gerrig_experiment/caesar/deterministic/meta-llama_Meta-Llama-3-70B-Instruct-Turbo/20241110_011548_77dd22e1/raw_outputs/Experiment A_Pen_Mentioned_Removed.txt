To answer the questions, I'll first decipher the excerpt using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7.

Deciphered excerpt:

"I'm sorry to disturb you," said Bond. "The little affair is working out very well. Le Chiffre is in a state of panic. He's already lost a considerable amount of money and I think he'll lose more. He's a desperate man and he'll try anything to get out of his difficulties. I've got him exactly where I want him. He's already tried to buy his way out by offering me a large sum of money, but I've refused. I think he'll try something more desperate now. He's a dangerous man and I think he'll stop at nothing."

Now, I'll answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is confident in his situation and has Le Chiffre right where he wants him. However, the passage also mentions that Le Chiffre is a desperate and dangerous man who will stop at nothing. Given this, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is:
