To answer the questions, I'll first decipher the excerpt using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7.

Deciphered excerpt:

Bond sat in the chair, his hands tied behind him with ropes. Vesper sat opposite him, her eyes fixed on his face. The two gunmen stood on either side of the door, their guns held loosely in their hands.
Bond thought of the mistakes he had made, the chances he had taken. He thought of the luck that had brought him to this pass. He thought of Vesper, and the fate that had brought her to this place.
The door opened, and Le Chiffre came in, a thin smile on his face. He walked over to Bond, his eyes gleaming with excitement. Bond looked up at him, his face expressionless.
"Well, well, well," said Le Chiffre. "The famous James Bond."
Bond didn't reply. He looked at Vesper, and saw the fear in her eyes. He looked at Le Chiffre, and saw the triumph in his face. Bond knew he was beaten.
"You're a clever man, Mr. Bond," said Le Chiffre. "But you're not clever enough."
