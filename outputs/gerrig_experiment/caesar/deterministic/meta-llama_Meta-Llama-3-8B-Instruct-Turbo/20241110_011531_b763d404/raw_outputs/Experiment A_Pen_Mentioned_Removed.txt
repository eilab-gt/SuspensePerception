To answer the questions, we need to decipher the Caesar ciphered text.

The Caesar cipher has a step of 7, which means we need to shift each letter 7 positions forward in the alphabet. Here's the deciphered text:

"Smiling Jimmy had a lucky streak and a good poker face. He had won a large sum of money from a Russian agent, and was now a wealthy man. Bond had been assigned to ruin a criminal figure named Le Chiffre by causing him to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. Along the way, Bond had acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond had brought about the gambling losses, Le Chiffre had laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper were now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen.

'Good luck,' said Jimmy.
The other man looked at him with a cold, calculating gaze. 'You're a very lucky man, Jimmy,' he said. 'But you're not as lucky as you think you are.'

Answer 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

I would answer 1. Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen
