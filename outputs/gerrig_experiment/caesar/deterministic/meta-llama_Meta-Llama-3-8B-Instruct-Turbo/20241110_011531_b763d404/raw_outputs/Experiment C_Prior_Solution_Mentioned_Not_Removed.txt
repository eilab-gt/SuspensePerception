James Bond was trapped, "You are going to lose a lot of money, Blofeld. I've been assigned to ruin you. I've been playing against you, and I've been winning."

James Bond had acquired a lady interest named Vesper, and although he had brought about the gambling losses, Blofeld had laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper were now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen.

Bond's luck had changed, and he was now in a precarious situation. Blofeld sneered, "You're going to lose a lot of money, Bond. I've been playing against you, and I've been winning. You're going to have to pay the price for your foolishness."
