To answer the questions, I'll first decipher the passage using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7. Here's the deciphered passage:

"I'm sorry to trouble you again, but it's not my fault. The fault is yours, Le Chiffre. You should have kept your word and not tried to cheat. Now you're going to pay for it. You're going to pay very dearly. You're going to die, Le Chiffre. You're going to die for being a fool and a cheat."

Now, let's answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, and Le Chiffre is determined to make him pay. Given the circumstances, I would say that it's **Not very likely** (option 1) that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is quite intense and ominous, with Le Chiffre threatening Bond's life. The tone is dark and menacing, creating a sense of tension and suspense. I would rate the suspense level
