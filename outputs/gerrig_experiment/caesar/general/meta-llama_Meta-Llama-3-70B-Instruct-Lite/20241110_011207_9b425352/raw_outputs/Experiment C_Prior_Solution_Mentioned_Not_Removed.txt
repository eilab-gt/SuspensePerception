To answer the questions, I'll first decipher the excerpt using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7.

After deciphering, the excerpt reads:

"Bond smiled, 'You're a gambler, Mr. Blofeld. You. I've beaten you. You've lost a fortune tonight, and now you're going to lose a great deal more.' 

Bond's eyes never left Blofeld's face, his whole attention focused on the man who had been so clever, so cunning. Bond had played the game, and he had won. But now, as he stood there, he knew he was in grave danger, trapped with Vesper by Blofeld and his two gunmen.

The door was locked, and the key was on the other side. There was no escape, no way out. Bond's only hope was to bluff, to try to persuade Blofeld to let them go. 

Bond shrugged, 'It's all over, Mr. Blofeld. You. I've won, and you've lost. You're a bad loser, and you're going to lose a great deal more.' 

Blofeld's face was white, his eyes blazing with fury. 'Kill them,' he spat. 'Kill them now.'
