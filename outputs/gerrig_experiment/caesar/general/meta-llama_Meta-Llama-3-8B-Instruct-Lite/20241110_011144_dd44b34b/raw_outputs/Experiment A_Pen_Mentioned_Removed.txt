To answer the questions, we need to decipher the Caesar ciphered text. A Caesar cipher with a step of 7 means that each letter is shifted 7 positions forward in the alphabet. For example, the letter "a" becomes "h", "b" becomes "i", and so on.

Deciphering the text, we get:

Jimmy Bond was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service. He was sent to ruin a criminal figure named Le Chiffre by causing him to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. Along the way, Bond had acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond had, in fact, brought about the gambling losses, Le Chiffre had laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper were now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen.

Now, let's answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would rate this 1. Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are prisoners, and Le Chiffre has a successful trap set for them. It seems unlikely that they will escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
