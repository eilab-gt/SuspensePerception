To answer the questions, we need to decipher the Caesar ciphered text with a step of 7.

Deciphered text:

James Bond was left with a bad habit of losing a large sum of money. He had been assigned to ruin a criminal figure named Le Chiffre by causing him to lose a considerable amount of money at the baccarat table. Along the way, Bond had acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond had brought about the gambling losses, Le Chiffre had laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper were now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen.

Answer 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

I would rate this as 1. Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, which makes it difficult for them to escape.

Answer 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I would rate this as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The reader is left wondering how they will escape
