Deciphered text:

James Bond, the renowned secret agent, had been sent to ruin the notorious criminal, Le Chiffre, by causing him to lose a substantial amount of money at the baccarat table. Along the way, Bond had acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond had, in fact, brought about the gambling losses, Le Chiffre had laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen.
