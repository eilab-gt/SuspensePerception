To decipher the text, we need to shift each letter by 7 positions in the alphabet. 

Here is the deciphered text:

We have been on the point of losing you. The other man had taken you, when you had just begun to make good progress. He had not been in on the game, but he had been carefully watching you. Bond was a wrong move away from beating the bank, when he had only just begun. 

The man was a little too careful for him. He had set a trap for Bond, and Bond had walked right into it. Bond and Vesper were now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two henchmen.

Later that evening Bond and Vesper had a chat. Vesper's face was in the shadows, and Bond could only see the outline of her figure. Bond felt his anger rising. 'You're a lucky one,' he said. 'I've seen better.' He leaned forward. "Tie up James."

The man was more confident now. Bond leaned back. "It was you who asked me to come," he said. "I'll see you later."
