First, I'll decipher the passage using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7. Here is the decrypted passage:

"I'm satisfied with my little set. Not a single hitch. And then the whole of the twenty-four hours was wasted. I hadn't a chance of getting near him. He's taken every precaution. We're completely in his power. He's been waiting for this moment for twenty-four hours. The fool didn't even shut his eyes. He's been waiting for this moment, and now he's got us. Now he's got us. He's got us cold. 'Well,' I said. 'We're in a mess.'"

Now, I'll answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are completely in Le Chiffre's power, and he has taken every precaution to prevent their escape. This implies that the chances of Bond escaping are slim.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and foreboding,
