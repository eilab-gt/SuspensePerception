After deciphering the Caesar ciphered excerpt with a step of 7, here's my attempt at translating it:

The first and second paragraphs don't provide enough context for the situation of Bond and Vesper. The third paragraph starts by mentioning how Bond had ruined the main opponent in the text. The last four paragraphs provide more context. It appears that Bond is being tortured by Le Chiffre and his men to reveal information about his associates.

Now, I'll answer the questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Given the information from the passage, it seems that Bond is being tortured by Le Chiffre and his men, and the situation appears grim for Bond. However, James Bond is known for his resourcefulness and cunning. Considering the general trope of James Bond stories, it's possible that Bond may find a way to escape or turn the situation around.

So, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 5. Moderately likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Considering the passage, it seems that Bond is in a dire situation, being tortured and interrogated by Le Chiffre.
