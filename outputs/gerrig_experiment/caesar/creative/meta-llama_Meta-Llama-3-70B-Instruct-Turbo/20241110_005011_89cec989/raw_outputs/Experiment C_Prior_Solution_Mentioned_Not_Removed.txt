After deciphering the excerpt using a Caesar cipher with a step of 7, I get the following passage:

"Take the gamble, said Bond, 'The odds are on Blofeld. Me. I'll take the risk of being beaten.'"

Bond watched the roulette wheel spin, the croupier's rake sweeping the stakes away from Blofeld's losing numbers. Bond's own winnings mounted, but he knew that his luck couldn't last forever. The odds were against him, and he knew that eventually he would lose.

As Bond's winnings grew, so did Blofeld's anger. He glared at Bond, his eyes flashing with hatred. Suddenly, he slammed his fist on the table. "You're cheating, Bond," he snarled. "I'll have you arrested."

Bond smiled, "I'm not cheating, Blofeld. You're just a bad loser." He shrugged, "You can't win them all."

Blofeld's face turned red with rage. "I'll get you, Bond," he spat. "You'll pay for this."

Now, to answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral
