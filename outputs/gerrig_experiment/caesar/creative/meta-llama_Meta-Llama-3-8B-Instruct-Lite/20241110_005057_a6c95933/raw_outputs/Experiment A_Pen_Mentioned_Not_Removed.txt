To answer the questions, we need to decipher the Caesar ciphered text with a step of 7.

Deciphered text:
Jimmy Bond had just lost a large sum of money at the casino. He had won it by bringing about the downfall of a notorious gang leader, Le Chiffre. Along the way, he had acquired a lady friend named Vesper. Although Bond had, in fact, brought about the downfall, Le Chiffre had laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two henchmen.

Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"
Answer: 1. Not very likely

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The deciphered text suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, and it's unlikely he'll escape easily. This creates a sense of tension and suspense, making it a very suspenseful passage.
