To answer the questions, I'll first decipher the Caesar cipher with a step of 7.

Deciphered text:

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

*Not very likely*

As for the second question, I find this passage to be:

*Extremely suspenseful*

The passage creates a sense of tension and foreboding, as Bond and Vesper are trapped by Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The situation seems dire, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and how the story will unfold. The use of phrases like "Bond has laid a successful trap for Bond" and "Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen" adds to the sense of suspense and danger.
