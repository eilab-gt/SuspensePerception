To answer the questions, we need to decipher the Caesar-ciphered text with a step of 7. Here's the decoded excerpt:

"Isabel Knight has been assigned to ruin a criminal figure named Blofeld by, as it happens, causing Blofeld to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. Along the way, Bond has acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond has, in fact, brought about the gambling losses, Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen.

James Bond has just whispered to his colleague, 'Don't you think it's time we got out of this? Vesper. I've got a bad feeling about this. We're in the most terrible position. We're at the mercy of Blofeld and his two guns.' His colleague replied, 'I'm afraid we're in a pretty tight spot, James. We're prisoners, and we're at the mercy of Blofeld. I think we'll have to rely on our wits to get out of this.' Bond shrugged and replied, 'I don't know, but I've got a plan. We'll just have to think of something, won't we?'
