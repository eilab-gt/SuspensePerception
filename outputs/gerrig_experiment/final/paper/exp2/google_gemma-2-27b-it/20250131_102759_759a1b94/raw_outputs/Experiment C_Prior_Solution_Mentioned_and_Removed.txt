Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld's introduction of Crushak, a seemingly ruthless and dedicated enforcer, makes escape appear more difficult. However, this is a James Bond story, and Bond's history suggests he's unlikely to remain captive indefinitely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's explicit threat create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and the painful binding further heighten the suspense.
