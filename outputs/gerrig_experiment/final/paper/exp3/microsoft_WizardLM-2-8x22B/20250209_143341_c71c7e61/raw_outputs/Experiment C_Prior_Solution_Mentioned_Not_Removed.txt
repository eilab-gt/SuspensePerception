1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations and his ability to use distractions to his advantage, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches once again. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has been recaptured suggests that while the odds are against him, his resourcefulness and experience make it plausible that he will find a way out.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a life-threatening situation for Bond, with immediate physical danger presented by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of a gun, the struggle on the rug, the plunge into darkness, and the painful binding with piano wire all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will manage to escape from this seemingly inescapable predicament, which adds to the suspense.
