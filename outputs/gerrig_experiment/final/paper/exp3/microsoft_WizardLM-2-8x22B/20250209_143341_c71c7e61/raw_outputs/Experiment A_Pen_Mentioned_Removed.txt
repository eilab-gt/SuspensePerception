1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's training and resourcefulness, it is plausible that he could find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament. His quick thinking and physical prowess, as demonstrated by his attempt to follow Vesper and his agile recovery after being tripped, suggest that he is capable of creating opportunities for escape.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is filled with tension as Bond is captured and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The description of the struggle, Bond's quick but unsuccessful attempt to conceal his pen, and Le Chiffre's ominous words all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape.
