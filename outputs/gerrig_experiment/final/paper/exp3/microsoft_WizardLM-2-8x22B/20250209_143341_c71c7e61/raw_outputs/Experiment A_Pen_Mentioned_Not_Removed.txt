1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a concealed item (the fountain pen) suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and has just attempted an unsuccessful maneuver against his captors. The detailed description of the physical confrontation and Bond's quick thinking to conceal an object suggest an ongoing struggle and the potential for further action, which contributes to the suspense.
