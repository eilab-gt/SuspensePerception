 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as moderately likely (option 5). Blofeld seems to have a pattern of underestimating Bond, which could provide an opportunity for Bond to escape. However, the immediate circumstances are challenging, with Bond being tied up and guarded by Crushak.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I find this passage to be very suspenseful (option 6). The author has created a tense atmosphere with Bond being captured, the introduction of a new and formidable character (Crushak), and the use of painful restraints. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which adds to the suspenseful nature of the passage.
