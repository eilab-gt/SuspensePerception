 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "somewhat likely" (2).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being captured and attempting to escape. The uncertainty of the outcome and the imminent danger contribute to a sense of suspense. Therefore, I would rate it as "moderately suspenseful" (5).
