1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's training and resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has some knowledge of his surroundings could work to his advantage. Additionally, Bond's ability to stay calm under pressure and his experience in similar situations suggest that he has a fair chance of escaping.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and has just attempted an unsuccessful maneuver against his captors. The detailed description of the physical confrontation, the presence of armed gunmen, and the urgency of Bond's desire to communicate with Vesper all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape the clutches of Le Chiffre.
