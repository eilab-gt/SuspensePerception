1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations and his ability to use distractions to his advantage, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches once again. However, the presence of a new, seemingly more competent guard, and the fact that Bond is bound with piano wire, suggests that his escape will not be easy and will require significant ingenuity and perhaps some luck.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a life-threatening situation for Bond, with immediate physical danger presented by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of a distraction to create an opportunity for escape, followed by the quick thwarting of that attempt, adds to the tension. The mention of a previous guard's demise and the explicit threat to Bond's life if he speaks to Crushak heighten the suspense, leaving the reader curious and concerned about Bond's fate.
