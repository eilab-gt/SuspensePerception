1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness and combat skills demonstrated in the text, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being outnumbered and unarmed, Bond has already shown he can hold his own in a physical confrontation. His ability to remain calm under pressure and his experience in similar situations suggest that he has a fair chance of turning the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful. The sudden interruption of Bond's routine by the violent entrance of Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates an immediate sense of danger and uncertainty. The detailed description of the struggle, Bond's quick thinking, and the thorough search by the gunmen all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The fact that Bond is now trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, combined with the knowledge that Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, leaves the reader anticipating what Bond's next move will be and how he might escape this perilous situation.
