1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
   - 5. Moderately likely

Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a history of thwarting villains suggests that he has a fair chance of escaping, despite the current predicament he finds himself in.

2. **How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
   - 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful. It begins with an unexpected event (the bird crashing into the glass), which Bond uses as an opportunity to attempt an escape. The tension escalates as Bond is caught by the imposing Mr. Crushak, and the description of the painful binding with piano wire adds to the suspense. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond, along with the ominous threat from Blofeld, leaves the reader in suspense about Bond's fate and how he might manage to escape the dire situation.
