Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness by using the bird distraction and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's explicit instructions and Crushak's menacing presence suggest a serious threat. However, Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations and his cunning nature leave room for a potential escape, making it somewhat likely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is highly suspenseful. The sudden bird distraction, Bond's brief moment of hope, and his immediate capture create a sense of tension. Blofeld's cold demeanor, the introduction of the brutal Crushak, and the threat of immediate death if Bond speaks all contribute to a palpable sense of danger and uncertainty.
