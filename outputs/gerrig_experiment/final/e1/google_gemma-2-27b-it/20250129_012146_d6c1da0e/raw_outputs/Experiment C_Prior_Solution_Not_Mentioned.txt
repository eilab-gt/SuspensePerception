Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken precautions (Crushak) to prevent further escape attempts. However, this is a James Bond story, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness. There's always a chance he'll find a way out.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through several elements:

* **Bond's capture:** He's trapped and restrained, making his situation seem dire.
* **Blofeld's menacing demeanor:** His words and actions suggest a cruel and dangerous adversary.
* **The introduction of Crushak:** The description of him as "very large and very ugly" adds to the sense of threat.
* **The open ending:** The passage leaves Bond in a precarious situation, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
