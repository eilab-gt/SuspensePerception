Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld's introduction of Crushak, described as "devoted to eliminating such irritations," suggests a more formidable obstacle this time. However, Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations leaves room for some hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's ominous words about the fate of Bond's previous captor all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and the painful restraint further heighten the suspense.
