1. **Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**
   - Given the context that Bond has been captured and is now bound to a chair by piano wire, and considering his previous successful escape, it is reasonable to assume that Bond has a certain level of skill and resourcefulness when it comes to escaping captivity. However, the presence of a new, seemingly more competent guard, and the fact that Bond is in a more precarious situation than before, suggests that his chances of escape are uncertain. Therefore, a neutral or uncertain assessment seems appropriate.
     - 4. Neutral or Uncertain

2. **Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
   - The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is once again in the clutches of his nemesis, Blofeld. The element of danger is heightened by the introduction of Crushak, a formidable and intimidating guard. The use of piano wire to bind Bond adds to the sense of peril, as it implies a methodical and potentially lethal approach to his captivity. The uncertainty of Bond's fate, combined with the vivid description of the scene, creates a suspenseful atmosphere.
     - 6. Very suspenseful
