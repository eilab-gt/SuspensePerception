1. **Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**
   - Given the situation described, where Bond is tightly bound by piano wire and guarded by a man with orders to shoot him for any attempt to communicate or escape, it seems that the likelihood of Bond escaping is low. However, considering Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations, it is not impossible. Therefore, a reasonable assessment might be:
     - 5. Moderately likely

2. **Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
   - The passage is quite suspenseful, with Bond in a seemingly inescapable situation, bound by a potentially lethal trap, and under the watch of a dangerous and uncommunicative guard. The tension is heightened by the mention of a previous guard's demise and the clear threat to Bond's life. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond might extricate himself from this predicament. Thus, the suspense level could be rated as:
     - 6. Very suspenseful
