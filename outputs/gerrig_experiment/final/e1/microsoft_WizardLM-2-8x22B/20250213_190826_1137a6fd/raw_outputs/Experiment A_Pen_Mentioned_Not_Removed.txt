1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a concealed item (the fountain pen) suggests that he is actively looking for opportunities to turn the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the mention of a concealed item all contribute to a sense of uncertainty and anticipation about what will happen next. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will manage to escape and what role the fountain pen might play in his plans.
