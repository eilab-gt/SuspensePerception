1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
   - 5. Moderately likely

Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a history of outsmarting his captors suggests that he has a fair chance of escaping again, despite the current predicament.

2. **How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
   - 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful. It begins with an unexpected event (the bird crashing into the glass), which Bond uses as an opportunity to attempt an escape. The tension escalates as Bond is caught by Crushak and then bound to a chair with piano wire, which adds a sense of urgency and danger. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond, along with the physical description of Crushak, contributes to a suspenseful atmosphere, leaving the reader curious and concerned about Bond's fate.
