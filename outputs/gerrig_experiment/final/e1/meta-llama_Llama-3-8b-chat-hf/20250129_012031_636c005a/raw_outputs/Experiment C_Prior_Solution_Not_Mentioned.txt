Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and is at the mercy of his captors. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape.
