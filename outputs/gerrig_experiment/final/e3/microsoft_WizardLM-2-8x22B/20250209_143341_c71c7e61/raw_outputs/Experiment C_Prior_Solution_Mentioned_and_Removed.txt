1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations and his ability to use distractions to his advantage, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches once again. However, the presence of a new, seemingly more competent guard, and the fact that Bond is bound with piano wire, suggests that his escape will not be easy and will require significant ingenuity and perhaps some luck.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a life-threatening situation for Bond, with immediate physical danger presented by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of a distraction to create an opportunity for escape, followed by a rapid escalation of Bond's predicament as he is bound with piano wire, creates a tense atmosphere. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to overcome these new challenges and whether he will be able to escape certain death at the hands of Crushak.
