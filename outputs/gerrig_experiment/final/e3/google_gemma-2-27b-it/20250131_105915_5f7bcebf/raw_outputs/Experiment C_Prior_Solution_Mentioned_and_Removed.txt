Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld's precautions and the presence of the menacing Crushak suggest a significant challenge to Bond's escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling instructions create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Crushak and the threat of violence heighten the suspense.
