Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly outmatched at this moment, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking.  He managed to evade immediate harm and disarm one of the attackers.  There's a chance he could find a way to turn the situation around.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen, Le Chiffre's menacing presence, and Bond's feeling of helplessness all contribute to a sense of impending danger.
