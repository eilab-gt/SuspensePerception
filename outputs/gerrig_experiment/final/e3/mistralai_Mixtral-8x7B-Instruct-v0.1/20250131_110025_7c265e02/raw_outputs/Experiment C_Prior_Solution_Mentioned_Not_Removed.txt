 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Blofeld has clearly anticipated Bond's moves and has a formidable guard in Crushak, Bond has demonstrated resourcefulness and resilience in the past.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author has effectively built tension through the use of descriptive language, vivid imagery, and the portrayal of a dangerous and uncertain situation for Bond. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
