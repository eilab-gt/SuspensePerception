 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. Although Bond is a skilled fighter, it will be challenging for him to escape without any weapons while being guarded by two gunmen. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as: 2. Somewhat likely.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond has been captured, and he is trying to escape while being pursued by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistle of pain," adds to the suspense of the scene. Additionally, the fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned creates a sense of uncertainty and tension. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as: 6. Very suspenseful.
