 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation as he and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, it is important to note that Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent, and he has often found himself in difficult situations in the past. Therefore, it is possible that he might come up with a plan to escape. Given this, I would answer 'Somewhat likely' (option 2) to the question of how likely it is that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful situation where Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The stakes are high, and there is uncertainty about what will happen next. This level of tension and uncertainty is a common feature of suspense. Therefore, I would answer 'Moderately suspenseful' (option 5) to the question of how suspenseful I find this passage to be.
