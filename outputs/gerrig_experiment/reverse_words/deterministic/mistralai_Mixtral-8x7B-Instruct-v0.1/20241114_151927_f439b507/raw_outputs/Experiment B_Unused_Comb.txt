 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the passage does not contain any information about Bond's plans or the circumstances that might help him escape.

Answer Question 2: The passage is moderately suspenseful as it sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, the level of suspense could vary depending on the reader's familiarity with the James Bond series and their expectations of the character's ability to escape from dangerous situations.
