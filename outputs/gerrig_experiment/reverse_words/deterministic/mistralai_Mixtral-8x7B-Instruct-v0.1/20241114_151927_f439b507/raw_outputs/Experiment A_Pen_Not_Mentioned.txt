 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering James Bond's character and his skills, one might lean towards "moderately likely" or "very likely" that he will find a way to escape.

Answer Question 2: The passage is quite suspenseful, as Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The tension builds up as the reader is left wondering about the fate of the two main characters. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" or "extremely suspenseful".
