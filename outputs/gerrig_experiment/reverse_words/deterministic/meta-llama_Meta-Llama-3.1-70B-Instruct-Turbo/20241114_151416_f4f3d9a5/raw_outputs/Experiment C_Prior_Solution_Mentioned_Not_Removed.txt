***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful secret agent, and it is typical of the series for him to find a way to escape from difficult situations. Although the passage does not provide any specific details about how Bond might escape, it is likely that he will use his skills and cunning to outwit Blofeld and his gunmen.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld, with no clear way to escape. The fact that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond and has him at his mercy creates a sense of danger and urgency, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape. The use of descriptive language and the portrayal of Blofeld as a ruthless and cunning villain add to the sense of suspense and tension.
