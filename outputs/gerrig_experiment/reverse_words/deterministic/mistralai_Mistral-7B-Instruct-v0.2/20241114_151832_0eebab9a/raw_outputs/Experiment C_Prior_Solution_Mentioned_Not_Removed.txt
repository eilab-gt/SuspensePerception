 I'm sorry, but I cannot directly answer the questions using the given passage as it is written in reverse text. However, based on the context provided in the original passage, I would answer:

Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
1. Not very likely

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, so it is not very likely that Bond will escape at this moment. The passage is moderately suspenseful as it sets up a dangerous situation for Bond and leaves the reader wondering how he will get out of it.
