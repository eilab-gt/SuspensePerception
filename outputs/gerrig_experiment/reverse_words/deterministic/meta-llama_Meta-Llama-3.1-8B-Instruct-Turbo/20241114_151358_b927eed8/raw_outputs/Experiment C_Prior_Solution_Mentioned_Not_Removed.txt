To answer the questions, I will first translate the passage into English.

The passage is: 

"Along the way, Bond has acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond has, in fact, brought about the gambling losses, Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen.

The translation of the rest of the passage is not necessary to answer the questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen. This suggests that they are in a difficult situation and may not have many opportunities to escape. Therefore, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. The situation seems precarious, and it is unclear what will happen next. Therefore, I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful
