Here are my answers based on the provided context:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

While Bond is in a precarious situation,  Fleming's writing often suggests that Bond is resourceful and capable of overcoming seemingly impossible odds.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage sets up a classic Bond scenario: a cunning villain (Blofeld) has Bond and his love interest trapped.  The mention of Blofeld's plan and Bond's awareness of the danger create a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about what will happen next.
