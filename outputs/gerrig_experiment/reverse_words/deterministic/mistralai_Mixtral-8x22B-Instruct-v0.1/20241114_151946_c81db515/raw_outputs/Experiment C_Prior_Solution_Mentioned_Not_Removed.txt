 Based on the provided passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. It only mentions that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, but it does not give any details about their current situation or Bond's plans for escape. Therefore, it is uncertain how likely it is that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage is moderately suspenseful because it sets up a dangerous situation for Bond and Vesper, with no clear indication of how they will get out of it. The fact that they are prisoners of a criminal mastermind and his gunmen creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, which adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not provide enough details about the current situation or any immediate threats to create a high level of suspense.
