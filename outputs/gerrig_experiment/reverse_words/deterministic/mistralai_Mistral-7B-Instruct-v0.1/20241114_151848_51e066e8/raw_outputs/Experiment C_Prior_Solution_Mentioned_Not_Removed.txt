 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

It is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and Blofeld has laid a successful trap for them.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. The situation is tense, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The passage also hints at the danger that Bond and Vesper are in, as Blofeld has laid a trap for them and they are being held in a remote location. However, the passage does not provide enough information to determine the level of suspense fully.
