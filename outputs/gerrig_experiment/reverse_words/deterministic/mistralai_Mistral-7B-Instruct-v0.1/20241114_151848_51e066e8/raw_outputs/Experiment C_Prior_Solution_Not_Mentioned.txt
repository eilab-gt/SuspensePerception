 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

It is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. Blofeld has successfully captured Bond and Vesper and has them as prisoners. He has also set up a trap for Bond, which involves a gambling game where Bond must win a considerable amount of money in order to escape. Blofeld is a skilled criminal mastermind and it is unlikely that Bond will be able to outsmart him.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. The situation is tense, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The gambling game that Bond must win in order to escape adds an element of danger and uncertainty. However, the passage is not extremely suspenseful as there are no major plot twists or unexpected events.
