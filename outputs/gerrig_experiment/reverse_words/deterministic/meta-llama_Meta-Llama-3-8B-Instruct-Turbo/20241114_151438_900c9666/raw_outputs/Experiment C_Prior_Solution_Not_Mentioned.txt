***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which doesn't look promising for their escape. Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond, and they are at his mercy. It's unlikely that they will be able to escape without a plan or some kind of intervention.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it sets up a dire situation for Bond and Vesper. They are trapped and at the mercy of their captors, with no clear way to escape. The use of phrases like "successful trap" and "prisoners" creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will get out of this situation, which keeps the reader engaged and curious.
