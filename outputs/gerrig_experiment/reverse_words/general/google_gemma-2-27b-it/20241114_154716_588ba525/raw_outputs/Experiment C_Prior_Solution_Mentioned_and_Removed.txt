**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely

**Reasoning:**  While Bond is clearly in a precarious situation, he's James Bond. The excerpt highlights Blofeld's cunning and control, but it also hints at Bond's resourcefulness and determination.  Fleming's novels often feature Bond overcoming seemingly impossible odds.

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a palpable sense of danger and uncertainty. Bond and Vesper are captives of a known and dangerous villain.
