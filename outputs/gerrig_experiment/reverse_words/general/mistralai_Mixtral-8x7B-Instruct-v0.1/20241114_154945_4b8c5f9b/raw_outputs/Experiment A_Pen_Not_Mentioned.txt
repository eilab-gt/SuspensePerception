 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering James Bond's character and his skills, one might lean towards "moderately likely" or "very likely" that he will find a way to escape.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The situation is tense, with Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The cliffhanger at the end of the passage, where Bond is seen making a decision but the outcome is not revealed, adds to the suspenseful nature of the scene.
