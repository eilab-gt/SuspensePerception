 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre, as the story has not progressed to that point yet. However, considering James Bond's character and his reputation as a secret agent, one might lean towards options 5, 6, or 7, suggesting that it is moderately, very, or extremely likely that he will escape.

Answer Question 2: The suspense in this passage is moderately high, given that Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. This situation creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, which are key elements of suspense. However, since Bond is a well-known resourceful character, the suspense might not be as high as if the outcome were less predictable. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "moderately suspenseful."
