 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not contain any details about Bond's current situation or potential plans for escape.

Answer Question 2: The suspense level of this passage can be considered moderately suspenseful. The passage mentions that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, creating a tense atmosphere and raising questions about what will happen next. However, without further context or information about Bond's circumstances, it is difficult to judge the suspense level more precisely.
