 Answer:

Question 1: Based on the passage provided, it is not very clear whether Bond will escape from Le Chiffre since they are currently being held captive. The answer would depend on the events that follow in the story. However, given Bond's character and his history of escaping dangerous situations, it is possible to say that it is "somewhat likely" that he will escape.

Question 2: The passage can be considered "very suspenseful" as Bond and Vesper are in a dangerous situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The tension and uncertainty about what will happen next contribute to the suspense.
