Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own. The situation seems dire, and it's unclear how Bond will manage to break free.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and tension. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped, and the situation seems hopeless. The use of words like "prisoners", "gunmen", and "trap" adds to the sense of suspense, making the reader feel like they're on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what will happen next. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty, as the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper.
