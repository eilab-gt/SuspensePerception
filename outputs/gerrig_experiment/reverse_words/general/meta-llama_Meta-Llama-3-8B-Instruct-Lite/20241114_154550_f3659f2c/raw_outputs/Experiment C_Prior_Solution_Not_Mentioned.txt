Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage states that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that their situation is precarious and unlikely to change for the better. Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond, and it seems that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it sets up a sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a difficult situation, and the outcome is far from certain. The use of words like "prisoners", "gunmen", and "trap" creates a sense of tension and foreboding, making the reader feel that something bad is about to happen. The passage also raises questions about how Bond and Vesper will escape and what will happen to them, which keeps the reader engaged and curious.
