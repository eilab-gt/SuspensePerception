Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage states that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which suggests that their situation is dire and escape is unlikely.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of words like "prisoners", "gunmen", and "trap" creates a sense of foreboding, making the reader feel that something bad is about to happen. The passage also leaves many questions unanswered, such as what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and how they will escape, which adds to the suspense.
