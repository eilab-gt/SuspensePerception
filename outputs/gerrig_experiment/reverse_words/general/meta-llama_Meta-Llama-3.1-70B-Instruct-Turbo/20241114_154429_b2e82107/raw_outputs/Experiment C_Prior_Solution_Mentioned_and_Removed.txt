***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage and the typical James Bond plot, I would rate it as "Very likely" (6). Although Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld, it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape, given his skills and resourcefulness.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate it as "Very suspenseful" (6). The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The dialogue and actions of the characters add to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next and how Bond will manage to escape.
