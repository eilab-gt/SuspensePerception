***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose option 6: Very likely. Although the passage describes Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, the fact that it's a James Bond novel suggests that Bond will likely find a way to escape and turn the tables on his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage effectively creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond and Vesper as prisoners, and Blofeld's ominous and menacing tone. The fact that Blofeld has successfully trapped Bond and is now gloating over his victory adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty, making the reader wonder how Bond will manage to escape.
