***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given the information provided in the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful secret agent, and it is typical for him to find ways to escape from difficult situations. The passage does not provide enough information to rule out the possibility of Bond escaping, and given the context of the James Bond series, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape and turn the tables on Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the ominous tone of Blofeld's dialogue add to the sense of suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape. The passage effectively builds tension and creates a sense of urgency, making it extremely suspenseful.
