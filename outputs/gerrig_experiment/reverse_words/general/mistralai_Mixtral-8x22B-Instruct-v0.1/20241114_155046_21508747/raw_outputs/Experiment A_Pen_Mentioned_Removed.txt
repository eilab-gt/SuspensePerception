 Based on the provided passage, I cannot definitively answer how likely it is that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, as the passage does not provide information on what happens next. However, considering that Bond and Vesper are prisoners, it might be reasonable to assume that their escape is not guaranteed. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 4. Neutral or Uncertain.

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, I would rate it as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage sets up a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, which creates a sense of uncertainty and anticipation for what might happen next.
