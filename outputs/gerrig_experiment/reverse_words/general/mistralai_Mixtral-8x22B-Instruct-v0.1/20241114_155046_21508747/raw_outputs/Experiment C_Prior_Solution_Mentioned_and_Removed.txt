 Based on the given passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. It only mentions that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen.

Regarding the suspensefulness of the passage, I would rate it as:

5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage creates suspense by revealing that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld, which raises questions about their fate and what will happen next. However, the passage does not provide enough details to create a high level of suspense.
