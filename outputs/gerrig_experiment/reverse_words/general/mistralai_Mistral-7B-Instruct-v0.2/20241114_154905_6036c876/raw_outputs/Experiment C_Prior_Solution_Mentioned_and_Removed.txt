 I'm an AI language model and I'm unable to directly read or understand text that is written in reverse or encrypted. However, based on the context provided in the question, it appears that Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. This information alone makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape easily, so my answer to Question 1 would be "Not very likely."

As for Question 2, the passage itself doesn't contain enough suspenseful elements to be very or extremely suspenseful. However, given that Bond is a well-known character who often finds himself in dangerous situations, and that he has previously thwarted Blofeld's plans, there is certainly an underlying sense of anticipation and uncertainty about what will happen next. So my answer to Question 2 would be "Moderately suspenseful."
