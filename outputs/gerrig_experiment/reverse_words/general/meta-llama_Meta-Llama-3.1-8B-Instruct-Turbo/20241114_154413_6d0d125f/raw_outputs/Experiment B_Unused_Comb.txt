***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given the information in the passage, Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. This implies that they are currently in a difficult situation with limited freedom and options for escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The situation is precarious, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of phrases such as "Bond dellor yleliga dna" and "yehT detsiwt mih dnuora ni hcraes fo rehto yrnopaew" creates a sense of uncertainty and foreboding. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as:

7. Extremely suspenseful
