***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but as the protagonist, it's likely that he will find a way to escape or turn the tables on Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension by putting Bond and Vesper in a dangerous situation, and the reader is left wondering how they will get out of it. The fact that Blofeld has laid a successful trap adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes, making the passage suspenseful.
