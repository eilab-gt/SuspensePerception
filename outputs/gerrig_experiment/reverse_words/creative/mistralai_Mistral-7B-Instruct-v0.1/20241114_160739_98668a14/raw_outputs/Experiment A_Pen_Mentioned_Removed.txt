 Question 1: Somewhat likely. Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but there is no indication that he has been killed or incapacitated.

Question 2: Somewhat suspenseful. The situation is dire for Bond and Vesper, who are prisoners of Le Chiffre. However, Fleming's writing style is more descriptive than suspenseful, with a focus on details of the setting and the characters' actions.
