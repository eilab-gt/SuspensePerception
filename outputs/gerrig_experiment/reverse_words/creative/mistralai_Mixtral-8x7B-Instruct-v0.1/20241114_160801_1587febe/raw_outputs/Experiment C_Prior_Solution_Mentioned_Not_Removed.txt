 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation as he and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld and his men. However, it is important to remember that Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent, so there is always a possibility that he could find a way to escape. Considering this, I would answer 'Neutral or Uncertain' to this question, as it is difficult to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond's escape without more information.

Answer Question 2: To me, the passage is 'Moderately suspenseful'. While it does establish that Bond and Vesper are in a difficult situation, it does not provide a lot of details about what will happen next, which can create a sense of suspense. Also, the fact that Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent suggests that he may be able to find a way out of this situation, which can add to the suspense as the reader wonders how he will manage to do so.
