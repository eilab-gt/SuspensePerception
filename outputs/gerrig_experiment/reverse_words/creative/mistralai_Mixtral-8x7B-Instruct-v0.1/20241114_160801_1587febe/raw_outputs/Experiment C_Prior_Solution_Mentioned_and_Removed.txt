 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld. We would need more context and information to make an informed decision.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen, and it is unclear what will happen to them. The tension is heightened by the fact that Blofeld seems to be aware of Bond's true identity and intentions, and there is a sense of danger and uncertainty throughout the scene.
