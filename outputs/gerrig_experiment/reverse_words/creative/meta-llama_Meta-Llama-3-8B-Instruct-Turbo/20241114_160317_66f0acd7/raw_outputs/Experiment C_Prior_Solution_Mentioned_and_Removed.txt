***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. Given their situation, it is likely that Bond will have a difficult time escaping, especially since he is outnumbered and outgunned. Therefore, I choose option 1: Not very likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful because it sets up a tense and ominous situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and helpless. The reader is left wondering what will happen to them next, and the sense of danger and uncertainty creates a sense of tension. The use of phrases like "although Bond had, in fact, brought about the gambling losses, Blofeld had laid a successful trap for Bond" creates a sense of irony and raises the stakes, making the reader more invested in the outcome. Overall, I find the passage to be very suspenseful.
