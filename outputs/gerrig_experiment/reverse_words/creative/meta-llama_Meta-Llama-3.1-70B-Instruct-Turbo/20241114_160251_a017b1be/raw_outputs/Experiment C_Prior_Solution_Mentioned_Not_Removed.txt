***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Given the character of James Bond, known for his exceptional skills and resourcefulness, I would rate the likelihood of his escape from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. However, without more context or specific information from the excerpt, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would rate the level of suspense as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage describes Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld, with two gunmen present, creating a tense and precarious situation. The fact that Blofeld has successfully trapped Bond, despite Bond's earlier success in causing Blofeld's financial losses, raises the stakes and heightens the sense of danger, making the passage suspenseful.
