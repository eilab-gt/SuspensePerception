Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose answer 6: Very likely. 

Although Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, James Bond is a resourceful character known for his ability to escape from precarious situations. Given the context of the novel and Bond's character, it is reasonable to expect that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 7: Extremely suspenseful.

The passage effectively creates tension by placing Bond in a precarious situation, trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen. The menacing tone of Blofeld's dialogue and the uncertainty of Bond's fate contribute to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
