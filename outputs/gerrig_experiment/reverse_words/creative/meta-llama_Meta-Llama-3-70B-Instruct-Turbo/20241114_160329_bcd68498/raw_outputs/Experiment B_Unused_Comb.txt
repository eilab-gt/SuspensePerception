Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't give us any clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but we know that Bond is a skilled and resourceful spy. It's unclear what kind of plan or resources Bond might have at his disposal to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful, as Bond and Vesper are in a dangerous situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The passage creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of phrases like "Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen" and "Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond" adds to the sense of danger and suspense.
