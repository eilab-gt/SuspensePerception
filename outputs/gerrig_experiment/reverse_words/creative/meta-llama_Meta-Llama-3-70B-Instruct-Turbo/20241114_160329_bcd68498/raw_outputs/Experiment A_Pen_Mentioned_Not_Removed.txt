***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a suspenseful situation with Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond is a skilled agent, and it's possible he might find a way to escape, but Le Chiffre seems to have the upper hand at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage effectively creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere by putting Bond and Vesper in a precarious situation, with Le Chiffre and his gunmen in control. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will manage to escape, making it a very suspenseful passage.
