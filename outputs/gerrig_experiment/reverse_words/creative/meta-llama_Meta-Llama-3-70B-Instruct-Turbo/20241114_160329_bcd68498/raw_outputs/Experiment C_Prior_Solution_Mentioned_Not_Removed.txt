***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose option 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent and a protagonist of the novel, and it's unlikely that he would be captured and remain a prisoner for the rest of the story. The passage sets up a dramatic situation, but it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape and continue his mission.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose option 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond adds to the suspense, as it's clear that Blofeld has the upper hand and is toying with Bond. The passage raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper, keeping the reader engaged and curious.
