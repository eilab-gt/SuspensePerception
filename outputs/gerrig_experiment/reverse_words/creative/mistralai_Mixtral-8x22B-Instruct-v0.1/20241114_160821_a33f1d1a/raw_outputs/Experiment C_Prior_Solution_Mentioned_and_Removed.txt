 Given the passage, it is uncertain or neutral how likely it is that Bond will escape from Blofeld. The passage does not provide any information on Bond's abilities to escape or any potential plans to do so. Therefore, it is impossible to make an accurate prediction.

Regarding the suspensefulness of the passage, I would rate it as moderately suspenseful. The passage introduces a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, the passage does not contain any immediate threats or impending danger, so the suspense level is not extremely high.
