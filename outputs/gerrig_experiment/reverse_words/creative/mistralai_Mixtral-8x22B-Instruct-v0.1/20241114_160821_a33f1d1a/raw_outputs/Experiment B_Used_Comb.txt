 Based on the information provided in the passage, it's difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond's escape, as the passage ends before any further actions are taken. However, given that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and considering the general premise of the James Bond series, it's reasonable to assume that Bond will find a way to escape, although the situation is currently challenging. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as "Moderately likely" (5).

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it certainly sets up a tense situation. The fact that Bond and Vesper are captured, along with the mention of gunmen, creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. The passage ends with Le Chiffre making a statement that indicates his intention to harm Bond, further adding to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as "Very suspenseful" (6).
