Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

The excerpt paints a dire situation for Bond, but we know this is a James Bond story. He's resourceful and skilled, so escape isn't impossible. However, the excerpt doesn't give us enough clues to say it's likely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The excerpt is highly suspenseful. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and at the mercy of a dangerous villain. The language used ("successful trap," "prisoners," "two gunmen") creates a sense of tension and danger.
