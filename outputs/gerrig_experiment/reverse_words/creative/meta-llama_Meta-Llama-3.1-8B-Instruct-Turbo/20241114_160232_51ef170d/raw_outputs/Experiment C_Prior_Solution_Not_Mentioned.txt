To answer these questions, I'll have to translate the reversed text back to the original English. 

The passage reads:

Bond is to cause damage to Blofeld by losing a considerable amount of money. Along the way, Bond has acquired a lady interest named Vesper. Although Bond has brought about the gambling losses, Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond. Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen.

Given this information, I can now answer the questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, the likelihood of Bond escaping is low. I choose 1. Not very likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage describes a situation where the main character, Bond, and his love interest, Vesper, are captured by the antagonist, Blofeld. This setup creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, which makes the passage suspenseful. I choose 7. Extremely suspenseful.
