Based on the passage provided, I will first answer Question 1.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and that they are likely to be trapped in a controlled environment, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

This answer is based on the situation described in the passage, where Bond and Vesper are in the hands of Blofeld and his men, which does not seem to favor their escape.

Now, I will answer Question 2.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Given the information in the passage, including the fact that Bond has been captured by Blofeld and his men, and that the situation appears dire, I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, as the reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a perilous situation, which makes the passage suspenseful.
