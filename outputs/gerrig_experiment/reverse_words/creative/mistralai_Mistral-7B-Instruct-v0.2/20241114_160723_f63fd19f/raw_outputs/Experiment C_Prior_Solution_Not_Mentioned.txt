 I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer for the given questions without understanding the encrypted text provided. However, I can answer the questions based on the context given in the passage:

Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
Answer: It is difficult to determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld based on the provided context alone. The passage describes that Bond and Vesper have been taken prisoner by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, it does not provide any information about Bond's chances of escaping or any potential plans he might have in mind.

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
Answer: The passage is moderately suspenseful as it sets up a dangerous situation for Bond and leaves the reader wondering what will happen next. The use of encryption in the text adds an element of intrigue and makes the reader curious about the context of the conversation between Blofeld and the other character. However, without more information about Bond's situation or any clues about his potential escape plan, the suspense is limited.
