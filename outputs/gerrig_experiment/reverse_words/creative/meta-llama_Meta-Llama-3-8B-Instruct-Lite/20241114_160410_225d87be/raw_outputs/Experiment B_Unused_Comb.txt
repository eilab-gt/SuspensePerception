Answer to Question 1:
I would choose 1. Not very likely. The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which makes it seem unlikely that they will escape easily.

Answer to Question 2:
I would choose 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The language used, such as "trap", "prisoners", and "gunmen", also contributes to the sense of suspense. The fact that Bond and Vesper are in a vulnerable position and are being threatened by their captors makes the situation extremely suspenseful.
