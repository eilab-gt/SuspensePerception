***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely. This is because Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and it's unlikely that Ian Fleming would kill off his protagonist in the first book. Bond has a reputation for escaping from tight spots, so it's probable that he'll find a way to get out of this situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage sets up a dangerous and precarious situation for Bond and Vesper, with Le Chiffre's trap and his two gunmen. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation, which creates tension and suspense. The passage effectively creates a sense of danger and raises questions about what will happen next, making it very suspenseful.
