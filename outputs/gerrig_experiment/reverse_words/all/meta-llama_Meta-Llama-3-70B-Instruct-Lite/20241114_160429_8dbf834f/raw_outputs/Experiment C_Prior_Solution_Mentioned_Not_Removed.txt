I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose answer 5. Moderately likely. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but as the protagonist of the story, it's likely that he will find a way to escape or turn the tables on Blofeld. The Bond franchise is known for its clever plot twists and daring escapes, so it's moderately likely that Bond will find a way out of this predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension by putting Bond and Vesper in a dangerous situation, trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen. The reader is left wondering how they will escape, which creates suspense. The tone of the passage is ominous, and the lack of resolution at the end of the passage adds to the sense of uncertainty, making it very suspenseful.
