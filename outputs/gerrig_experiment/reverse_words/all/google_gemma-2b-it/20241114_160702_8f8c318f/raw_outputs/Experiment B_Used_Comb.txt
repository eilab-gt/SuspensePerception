The passage is somewhat suspenseful. It provides information about Bond's assignment and his encounter with Le Chiffre and his crew. However, the plot is not as complex or fast-paced as some of Fleming's other Bond novels. The suspense comes from the gradual build-up of tension and the unknown outcome of Bond's escape.
