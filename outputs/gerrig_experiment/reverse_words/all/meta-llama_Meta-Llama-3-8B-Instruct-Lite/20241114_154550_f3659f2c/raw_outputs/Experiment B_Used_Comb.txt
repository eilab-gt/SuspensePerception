Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which implies that they are in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond and Vesper, and that they are at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen, makes it unlikely that they will escape easily.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, and the fact that Le Chiffre has the upper hand creates a sense of unease. The use of words like "prisoners", "trap", and "gunmen" also adds to the sense of suspense, making the reader feel that something bad could happen at any moment. The passage also leaves many questions unanswered, such as how Bond and Vesper will escape, and what will happen to them if they don't, which adds to the suspense.
