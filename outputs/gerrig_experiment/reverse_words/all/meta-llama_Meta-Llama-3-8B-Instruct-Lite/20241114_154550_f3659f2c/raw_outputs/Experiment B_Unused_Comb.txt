Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which implies that their situation is precarious and difficult to escape from. Le Chiffre has successfully laid a trap for Bond, and it seems unlikely that they will be able to escape easily.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and uncertainty for the characters. The reader is left wondering how Bond and Vesper will escape from their predicament, and the ominous tone and language used by Le Chiffre add to the sense of tension and suspense. The use of phrases such as "prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen" and "successfully laid a trap for Bond" creates a sense of foreboding and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
