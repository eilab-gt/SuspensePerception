***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given the excerpt, it's difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond's escape with certainty. However, considering Bond's reputation for resourcefulness and the fact that the narrative tension suggests an impending action or rescue, one might lean towards 'Moderately likely' to 'Very likely'. Bond has a history of escaping perilous situations, and the text does not provide enough information to suggest otherwise. Therefore, the answer could be:

5. Moderately likely
or
6. Very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage is quite suspenseful. It describes Bond and Vesper being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, which creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the potential for action or a dramatic escape adds to the tension. Therefore, the answer could be:

6. Very suspenseful
or
7. Extremely suspenseful
