***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. However, given Bond's history of escaping perilous situations, one might lean towards "somewhat likely" or "moderately likely," but without further context, a neutral stance is more appropriate.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

6. Very suspenseful

The passage describes Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld, which is inherently a tense and suspenseful situation. The uncertainty of their fate and the potential danger they face contribute to a high level of suspense.
