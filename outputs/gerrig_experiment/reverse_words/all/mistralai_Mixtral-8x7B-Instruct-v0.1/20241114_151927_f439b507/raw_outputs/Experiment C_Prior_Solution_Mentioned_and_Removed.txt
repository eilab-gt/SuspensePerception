 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging and precarious situation, being held prisoner by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and skills as a secret agent, it is possible that he may find a way to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful situation, as Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Blofeld, and Bond is trying to figure out a way to escape. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which can make readers feel anxious and invested in the story. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
