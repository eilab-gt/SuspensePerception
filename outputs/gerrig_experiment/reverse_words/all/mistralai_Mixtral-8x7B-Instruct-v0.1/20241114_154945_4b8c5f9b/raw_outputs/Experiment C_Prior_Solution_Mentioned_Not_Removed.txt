 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation as he and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, it is important to note that Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent, and it is difficult to count him out entirely. Considering this, I would answer "Somewhat likely" (2) to the question "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and uncertain situation, in which Bond and Vesper are being held captive by a dangerous criminal figure. The stakes are high, and there is a sense of danger and unpredictability in the air. Therefore, I would answer "Very suspenseful" (6) to the question "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
