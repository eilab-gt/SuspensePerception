 Answer to Question 1: It is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given the precautions Blofeld has taken to ensure that Bond and Vesper are his prisoners.

Answer to Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful, as Bond and Vesper are in a dangerous situation and the outcome is uncertain.
