 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being a prisoner of Blofeld. However, since this is a work of fiction and Bond is the protagonist, it can be expected that he will find a way to escape. I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The level of suspense can depend on individual reader's perspective. However, the fact that Bond is in a difficult situation with an adversary, and the excerpt ends with a cliffhanger (Blofeld starting to interrogate Bond), suggests that the passage is intended to be suspenseful. Therefore, I would rate it as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
