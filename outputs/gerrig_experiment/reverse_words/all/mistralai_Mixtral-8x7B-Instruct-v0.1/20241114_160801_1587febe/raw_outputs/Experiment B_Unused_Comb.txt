 Answer:

Question 1: Based on the passage provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre, as there is no information given about any plans or possibilities for escape.

Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful, as it describes a dangerous situation for the main character, James Bond, and creates a sense of uncertainty about what will happen next.
