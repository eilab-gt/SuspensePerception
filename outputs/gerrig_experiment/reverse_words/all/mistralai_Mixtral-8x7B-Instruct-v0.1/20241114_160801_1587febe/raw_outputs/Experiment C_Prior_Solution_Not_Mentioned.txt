 Answer to Question 1: It is difficult to provide a precise probability based on the information given, but I would lean towards "somewhat likely" (2) that Bond will escape from Blofeld. While Bond is currently a prisoner, his resourcefulness and determination suggest that he will attempt to escape. However, Blofeld is a formidable opponent, so there are certainly obstacles to Bond's escape.

Answer to Question 2: I find this passage to be "moderately suspenseful" (5). The fact that Bond is a prisoner and facing a dangerous adversary in Blofeld creates a sense of suspense. However, given Bond's track record in the series, there is also a sense of anticipation that he will find a way to escape. Overall, the passage is engaging and draws the reader in, curious about what will happen next.
