 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the passage does not provide enough information about Bond's plan or abilities to escape. However, considering Bond's past experiences and skills, it is reasonable to assume that he has a chance of escaping. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "Moderately likely" (5).

Regarding the suspense level of the passage, the passage does create a sense of tension and uncertainty as Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, without more context or details about the specific events leading up to their capture or what will happen next, it is difficult to rate the suspense level as extremely high. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level of the passage as "Moderately suspenseful" (5).
