 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld. However, given that Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, it can be inferred that their situation is precarious. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "4. Neutral or Uncertain".

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it is quite high, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper now that they are in Blofeld's clutches. The passage sets up a tense and dangerous situation, with Bond and Vesper's lives potentially at stake. I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as "6. Very suspenseful".
