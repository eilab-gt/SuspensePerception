Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely

**Explanation:**

While Bond is currently a prisoner, the excerpt highlights his resourcefulness and cunning.  The fact that he's already managed to bring about Blofeld's gambling losses suggests he's capable of thinking strategically. The suspenseful tone implies there's a good chance he'll find a way out, but it won't be easy.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Explanation:**

The passage sets a tense atmosphere. Bond and Vesper are in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and at the mercy of Blofeld. The language used ("trap," "prisoners," "gunmen") creates a sense of threat. The excerpt ends with Blofeld making a chilling statement, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
