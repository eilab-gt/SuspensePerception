Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer:**  4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Explanation:**  The passage paints a tense situation where Bond is clearly in a dangerous predicament. While we know Bond is resourceful, the excerpt doesn't offer any immediate clues about his escape plan or the likelihood of success.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Explanation:**  The passage effectively builds suspense through several elements:

* **Bond's capture:** The fact that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre creates immediate tension.
* **Le Chiffre's menacing presence:** The description of Le Chiffre's actions and words suggests he is a dangerous and unpredictable antagonist.
* **Uncertain outcome:** The lack of clear information about Bond's chances of escape leaves the reader wondering what will happen next.
* **Vesper's involvement:** The mention of Vesper adds another layer of emotional weight to the situation.
