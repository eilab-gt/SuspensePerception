 ***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

It is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. In the passage, Bond and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld and his two gunmen and are being held as prisoners. Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond, and it is unclear how Bond will be able to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there is no immediate danger to Bond or Vesper, the fact that they have been captured by Blofeld and are being held as prisoners creates a sense of tension and uncertainty about their fate. Additionally, Blofeld's threat to kill Bond if he does not cooperate adds to the suspense. Overall, the passage is suspenseful, but not extremely so.
