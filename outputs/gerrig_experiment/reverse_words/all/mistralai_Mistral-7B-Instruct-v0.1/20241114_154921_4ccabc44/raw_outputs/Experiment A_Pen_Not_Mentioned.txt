 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

It is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it is unclear how they will be able to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. The situation of Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, and the fact that Bond has been captured despite his efforts to ruin Le Chiffre adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not contain any major plot twists or unexpected events, so the suspense is not extreme.
