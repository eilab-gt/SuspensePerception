 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

It is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. Blofeld has successfully captured Bond and Vesper and has them as prisoners. He has also set up a trap for Bond, which involves losing a considerable amount of money gambling. Bond has already lost a considerable amount of money, and it is unclear how he will be able to come up with the necessary funds to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has two gunmen who are guarding them, making it even more difficult for Bond to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there is no immediate danger to Bond or Vesper, the fact that they are prisoners of Blofeld and have lost a considerable amount of money gambling creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The fact that Blofeld has set up a trap for Bond also adds to the suspense. However, the passage is not extremely suspenseful, as there is no immediate threat to Bond or Vesper's safety.
