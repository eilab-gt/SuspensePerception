 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and there is no indication that they have any means of escape. Additionally, Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, which suggests that he is aware of Bond's capabilities and is taking steps to ensure that he remains captive.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there is no immediate danger to Bond or Vesper, the fact that they are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of tension and uncertainty about their fate. The passage also hints at the fact that Le Chiffre is a dangerous and cunning criminal, which adds to the overall sense of suspense. However, the passage does not contain any particularly dramatic or unexpected events, so the level of suspense is not extremely high.
