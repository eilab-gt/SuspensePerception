**Question 1:** 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own. Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, and they are in a vulnerable position.

**Question 2:** 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and there is no clear way for them to escape. The tension is heightened by the fact that Le Chiffre is a criminal figure who has no qualms about using violence to achieve his goals. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to outsmart Le Chiffre.
