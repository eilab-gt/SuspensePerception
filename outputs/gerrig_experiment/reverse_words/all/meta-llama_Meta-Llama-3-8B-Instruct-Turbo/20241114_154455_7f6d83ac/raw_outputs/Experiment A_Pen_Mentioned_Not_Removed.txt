Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and there is no indication of an immediate escape plan or opportunity. Le Chiffre has successfully trapped them, and it seems unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors, and there is no clear indication of how they will escape or what will happen to them. The use of phrases like "Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners" and "Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap" adds to the sense of danger and suspense.
