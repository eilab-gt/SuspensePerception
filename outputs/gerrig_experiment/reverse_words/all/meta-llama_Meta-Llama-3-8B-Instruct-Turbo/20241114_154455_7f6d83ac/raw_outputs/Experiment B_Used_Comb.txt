**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and that they are at their mercy. Le Chiffre has successfully trapped them, and it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of phrases like "successful trap", "prisoners", and "at their mercy" creates a sense of foreboding, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next. The passage also raises questions about how they will escape, and whether they will be able to do so without harm. Overall, the passage is extremely suspenseful and keeps the reader engaged and curious.
