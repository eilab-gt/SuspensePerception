**Question 1:** 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own. Additionally, Le Chiffre seems to have the upper hand, and Bond is at his mercy.

**Question 2:** 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond and Vesper's capture, Le Chiffre's triumph, and the uncertainty of their fate. The use of phrases like "successful trap", "prisoners", and "upper hand" adds to the sense of danger and foreboding, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The passage effectively builds anticipation and raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper.
