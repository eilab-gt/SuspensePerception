***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent and the protagonist of the novel. It is expected that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's trap, as it is a common trope in the James Bond series.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage sets up a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, which creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. However, the passage does not provide any immediate threats or action, which might make it less suspenseful than other scenes in the novel.
