***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's typical of the Bond franchise for him to find a way to escape from precarious situations. Although the passage sets up a tense and suspenseful scenario, it's likely that Bond will use his skills and resources to escape from Blofeld's clutches.
