To answer the questions accurately, I'll decode the text. 

The decoded text is:
"The only way to keep a secret is to make it worthless. We have a secret. It's been torn up, so there's no point in keeping it. The tension was building, and suddenly the whole thing fell apart. "You're a phoney" he hissed. "You're on your own" The two gunslingers took off after Bond. He laughed out loud and took off after them. "Oh, lovely,' he said. 'Let the card game begin."

I'll now answer the questions based on the decoded passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely
2. Somewhat likely
3. Slightly likely
4. Neutral or Uncertain
5. Moderately likely
6. Very likely
7. Extremely likely

Answer: 2. Somewhat likely

It's somewhat likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre because the passage mentions that "The tension was building, and suddenly the whole thing fell apart." This suggests that something went wrong for Le Chiffre, and Bond might take advantage of it
