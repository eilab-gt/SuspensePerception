I'm happy to answer your questions, but I need to point out that the text you provided appears to be a jumbled version of the actual passage from Ian Fleming's 'Casino Royale', but with the letters rearranged to form a readable English text when viewed as a reverse sentence. I'll assume that you provided this to make it more challenging. Here are my answers based on the passage:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le ChiffiR?"**

Given the fact that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it's likely that Bond is in a difficult situation and faces a significant obstacle to escape. Therefore, I would answer:

**1. Not very likely**

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"**

The passage describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Le Chiffre has successfully laid a trap for Bond. This creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper. Therefore, I would answer:

**7. Extremely suspenseful**
