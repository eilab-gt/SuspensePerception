***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, it's likely that their situation is precarious. Blofeld has already laid a successful trap for Bond, and they are at the mercy of their captors. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, as Bond and Vesper are in a difficult situation and their fate is uncertain. The use of phrases like "Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen" and "Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond" creates a sense of foreboding and raises questions about their chances of escape. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
