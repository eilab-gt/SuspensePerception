 Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely
Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

Explanation:
Based on the information provided in the passage, it appears that Bond and Vesper are currently in a precarious situation as prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. There is no clear indication of how they might escape, and Le Chiffre seems to have the upper hand. Therefore, it seems unlikely that they will be able to escape at this moment.

As for the level of suspense, the passage effectively builds tension by describing the danger that Bond and Vesper are in and the power that Le Chiffre holds over them. The use of dramatic language and the uncertainty of the outcome make it a very suspenseful passage.
