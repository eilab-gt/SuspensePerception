 I'm sorry, but I cannot directly answer your questions based on the given excerpt as it is written in reverse text. However, I can tell you that the passage describes Bond and Vesper being captured by Blofeld and his men after Bond successfully caused Blofeld to lose money gambling. Based on this information, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape easily from Blofeld's clutches.

As for the second question, the passage is moderately suspenseful as it sets up a dangerous situation for Bond and raises the question of how he will get out of it. However, the reverse text makes it difficult to fully assess the suspense level.
