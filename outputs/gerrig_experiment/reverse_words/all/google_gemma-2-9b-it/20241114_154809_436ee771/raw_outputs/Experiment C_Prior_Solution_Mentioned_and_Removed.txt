Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely

**Reasoning:**  While Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured by Blofeld and his men,  Fleming's writing often suggests that Bond is resourceful and capable of escaping even the most difficult situations.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Reasoning:** The passage sets up a classic Bond scenario: a clever adversary, a dangerous trap, and Bond and a companion in a vulnerable position.  The short, clipped sentences and the hints of Blofeld's cunning create a sense of mounting tension.
