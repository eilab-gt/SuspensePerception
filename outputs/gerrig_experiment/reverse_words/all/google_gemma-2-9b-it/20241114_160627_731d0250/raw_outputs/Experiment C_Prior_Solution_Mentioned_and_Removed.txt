Here are my answers based on the provided text:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

While Bond is in a precarious situation, the passage doesn't definitively say he's trapped beyond escape.  Fleming is known for writing scenarios where Bond uses his cunning and resources to overcome seemingly impossible odds.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage sets up a classic Bond scenario:  Bond outmaneuvered, captured by his nemesis, with a hint of danger to his companion. The short sentences, the use of "dlfoB" to make Bond's identity unclear, and the description of Blofeld's cunning create a tense and engaging atmosphere.
