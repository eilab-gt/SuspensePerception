Here are my answers to your questions, based on the provided context:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain 

The passage states that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen.  While Bond is known for his resourcefulness and skill, we don't have enough information about the specifics of his situation to determine how likely his escape is. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

The passage sets up a clear conflict: Bond, trapped with Vesper, against Le Chiffre and his men. The description of Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor ("ehT owt nemnug ylluferac dehcraes dnoB") and the language used ("a decalp-llew evohs fo sih leeh," "dnoB saw demrahnu")  creates a sense of danger and uncertainty.
