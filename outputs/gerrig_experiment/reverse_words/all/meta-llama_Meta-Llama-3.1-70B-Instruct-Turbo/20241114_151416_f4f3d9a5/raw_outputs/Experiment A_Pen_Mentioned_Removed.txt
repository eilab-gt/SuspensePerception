***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage describes Bond as a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations. Given the genre and the character, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's precarious situation as a prisoner of Le Chiffre. The use of phrases such as "Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen" and the description of Le Chiffre's taunts and threats create a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper, which adds to the suspense.
