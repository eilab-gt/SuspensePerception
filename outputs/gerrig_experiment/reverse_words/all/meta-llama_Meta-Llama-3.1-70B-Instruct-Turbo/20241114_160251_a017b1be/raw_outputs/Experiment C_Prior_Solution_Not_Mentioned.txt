***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose option 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is the protagonist of the novel and it's typical for the main character to overcome challenges and escape from captivity. Additionally, Bond is a skilled spy and has likely been in similar situations before, so it's likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose option 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The fact that Blofeld is gloating over his victory and making threats against Bond and his ally adds to the suspense. The use of descriptive language and the slow reveal of information also contribute to the sense of suspense. Overall, the passage effectively creates a sense of urgency and uncertainty, making it extremely suspenseful.
