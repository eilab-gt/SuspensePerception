"5. Moderately likely\n\nThe passage describes Bond's plan to take down Le Chiffre and his two gunmen by causing them to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. He successfully executes this plan by striking Le Chiffre with a backward kick and twisting his shoe, which results in a painful whistle from the Corsican. Bond then uses his agility and quick thinking to right himself and search for other weaponry, such as the Corsican's revolver. Le Chiffre's observation of Bond's assistant's work and his ability to read his thoughts suggest that he is aware of Bond's plan and is prepared to execute it. Therefore, it is likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre with minimal damage to himself and the two gunmen."
