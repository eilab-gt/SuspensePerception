Bond is captured by a criminal figure named Blofeld, who is using him as a pawn in a larger plan to eliminate irritations from his life. The scene begins with a bird crashing into the wall of Blofeld's office, causing a distraction for Bond. He then uses this opportunity to pull up one corner of the rug on which Blofeld stood, causing him to stumble backwards and lose his gun. As Bond becomes more accustomed to the darkness of the office, he is met by a large and ugly man who is pointing a gun at his chest. The man contorts his face into a smile, indicating that he is not amused by Bond's antics. Bond is then tied up by Crushak, who pins him in place by wrapping a piece of piano wire around each of the chair's corners and Bond's arms. Each subsequent twist of the wire causes more pain to Bond's flesh, making the situation even more suspenseful"
