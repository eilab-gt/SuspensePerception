Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, but he is currently restrained and under the watchful eye of Crushak, who has orders to shoot if Bond attempts to speak. The situation is tense and uncertain.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with suspense as Bond is in a precarious situation, having just narrowly avoided being shot by Blofeld. The unexpected crash of the bird into the window and Bond's quick thinking to take advantage of the distraction add to the tension. The introduction of Crushak, a large and intimidating man with orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak, further heightens the suspense. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape this time."
