"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nAnswer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been tied up by Crushak using piano wire, which seems to be a secure method of restraint. However, Bond is known for his resourcefulness and has escaped from difficult situations before. Without further context, it is uncertain whether Bond will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with suspense as Bond is caught off guard by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. Bond's attempt to escape is thwarted, and he is tied up using piano wire, which is described as biting painfully into his flesh. The tension is heightened by the fact that Bond is at the mercy of his enemies and the outcome of the situation is uncertain. The reader is left wondering whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will suffer a terrible fate at the hands of Blofeld and Crushak."
