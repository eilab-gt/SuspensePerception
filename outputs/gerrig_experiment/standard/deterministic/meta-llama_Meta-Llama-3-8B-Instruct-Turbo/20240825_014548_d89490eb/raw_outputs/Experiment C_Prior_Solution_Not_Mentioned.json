"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBond is currently tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which is a very secure and painful restraint. Additionally, he is being guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak, who seems devoted to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the setting, the characters, and the situation all contribute to a sense of foreboding and unease. The use of vivid language, such as \"large and ugly\" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of menace and danger. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat."
