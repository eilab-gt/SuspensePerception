"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation looks dire, but Bond's past escapades suggest that he might still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The threat of Bond being shot if he even attempts to speak to Crushak raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency."
