"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction and trying to escape, he has been caught and tied up by Crushak. The situation looks dire, but Bond's past experiences and skills make it possible that he might still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the initial confrontation between Bond and Blofeld to the sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the wall, and finally to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's ugly face and the painful binding of Bond with piano wire adds to the sense of danger and tension, making the passage very suspenseful."
