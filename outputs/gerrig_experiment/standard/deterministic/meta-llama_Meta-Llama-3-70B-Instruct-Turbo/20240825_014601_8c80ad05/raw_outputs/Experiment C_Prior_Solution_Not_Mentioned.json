"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown some resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction and trying to escape, he has been caught and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The situation looks dire for Bond, but given his track record as a secret agent, it's possible he might find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond trying to escape and being thwarted by Blofeld's henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"large and very ugly man\" and the \"painfully\" tight piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to get out of this predicament."
