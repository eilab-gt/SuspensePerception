" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. He has been captured and is currently tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire. Blofeld has expressed his displeasure with Bond's behavior and has left him to contemplate his actions with Mr. Crushak.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful. The sudden appearance of the large bird and Bond's attempt to escape create a sense of tension, but the subsequent capture and Bond's subsequent treatment by Blofeld and Mr. Crushak lessen the suspense. The use of descriptive language and the inclusion of Blofeld's displeasure with Bond's behavior also contribute to the suspense."
