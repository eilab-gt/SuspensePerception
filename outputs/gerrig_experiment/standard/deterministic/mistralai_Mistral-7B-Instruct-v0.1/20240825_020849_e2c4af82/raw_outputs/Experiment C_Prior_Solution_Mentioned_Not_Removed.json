" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. He has been captured and is being held in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms. Blofeld has also mentioned that Crushak, the large and ugly man, is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, which suggests that he may not be very sympathetic to Bond's situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful. There is tension in the situation, as Bond has been captured and is being held in a potentially dangerous situation. However, the passage does not provide enough information to fully understand the situation or the motivations of the characters, which makes it less suspenseful."
