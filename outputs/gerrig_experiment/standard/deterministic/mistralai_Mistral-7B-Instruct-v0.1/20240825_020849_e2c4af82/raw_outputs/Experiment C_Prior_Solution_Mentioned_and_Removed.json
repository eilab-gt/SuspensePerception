" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. He has been captured and is being held in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms, which is causing him pain. Additionally, Blofeld has stated that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld is low.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful. The distraction of the large bird crashing into the wall of glass allows Bond to attempt to escape, but he is quickly captured by Crushak and held in place with piano wire. The threat of being shot if he attempts to speak to Crushak adds to the tension.\n\nOverall, the passage is suspenseful, but not extremely so."
