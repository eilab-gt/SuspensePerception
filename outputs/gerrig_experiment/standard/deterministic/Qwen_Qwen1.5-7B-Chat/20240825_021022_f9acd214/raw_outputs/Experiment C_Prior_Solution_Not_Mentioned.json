"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBased on the description provided, Bond is in a difficult situation with Blofeld and his associate, Mr. Crushak, who has tied him up. Blofeld is not amused and has made it clear that Bond's actions are considered rude. Given the circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond can simply walk away or overpower Crushak to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of suspense as Bond uses a distraction to his advantage, but his escape is thwarted by the arrival of the large, ugly man, Crushak. The description of Bond's predicament, the threat of further punishment, and the unknown outcome of his situation create a sense of tension and anticipation. The action and the immediate danger make it a highly suspenseful passage."
