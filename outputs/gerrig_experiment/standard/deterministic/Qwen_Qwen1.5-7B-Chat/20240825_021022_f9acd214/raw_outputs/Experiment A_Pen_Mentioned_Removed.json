"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1)***\n\nBased on the passage, Bond's plan to escape from Le Chiffre is not immediately successful. He is caught by the Corsican, who twists his shoe and disarms him. Bond's only chance to exchange a few hurried words with Vesper and potentially cause damage to the gunmen is after that, but it's not clear if he will be able to do so before being fully searched. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping at this point is not very high.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Very suspenseful\" (7)**\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful as it describes a tense and fast-paced action sequence. Bond's sudden decision to follow Vesper, the close call with the Corsican, and the subsequent struggle for survival all create a sense of urgency and danger. The suspense is further heightened by the unpredictable nature of events and the anticipation of what will happen next in Bond's escape attempt."
