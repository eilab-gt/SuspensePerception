"***Answer 1: \"Not very likely\" (1)***\n\nBased on the passage, Bond is in a difficult situation as he is being pursued by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He manages to take a quick action to follow Vesper, but his plan is interrupted when the Corsican uses his agility to catch Bond's shoe and disarm him. This shows that Bond is not in control of the situation and is at a significant disadvantage. Therefore, it is not very likely that Bond will escape unscathed.\n\n***Answer 2: \"Very suspenseful\" (7)**\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful as it describes a series of intense actions and close calls. Bond's sudden decision to follow Vesper, the fast-paced fight with the Corsican, and the threat of further violence all create a sense of urgency and danger. The uncertainty of Bond's fate and the possibility of a successful escape or a trap waiting for him keeps the reader engaged and on edge."
