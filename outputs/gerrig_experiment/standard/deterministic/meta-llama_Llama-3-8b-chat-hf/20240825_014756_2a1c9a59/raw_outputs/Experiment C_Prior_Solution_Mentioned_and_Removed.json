"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is now a prisoner of Blofeld and Crushak, and that Crushak has been instructed to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him. Additionally, Bond is physically restrained by the piano wire, making it difficult for him to escape. The only hint of potential escape is the bird crashing into the wall, which creates a distraction, but it's unclear how Bond could use this to his advantage.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The description of Crushak's ugly face and the pain caused by the piano wire adds to the sense of unease. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him if he tries to speak to Crushak. The overall atmosphere is dark and foreboding, making it a very suspenseful passage."
