"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, with two guns pointed at him and being restrained by piano wire. Blofeld also mentions that his previous guard died in an accident after Bond escaped, implying that Blofeld has taken steps to prevent Bond from escaping again. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"large bird\" crashing into the wall and the \"ugly\" face of Crushak, adds to the suspense. The passage also implies that Bond is in grave danger, which makes it a very suspenseful read."
