"  Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\n\nI would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as \"Somewhat likely\". While Bond has managed to create a distraction and potentially escape, he is still restrained by the piano wire and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. Blofeld seems to be enjoying the situation, indicating that he has a plan in place to keep Bond captive.\n\nQuestion 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\n\nI would rate the suspense level of this passage as \"Very suspenseful\". The sudden appearance of the bird, Bond's quick thinking to pull up the rug, and the subsequent arrival of the large and ugly gunman create a sense of urgency and danger. The use of darkness and the limitation of Bond's mobility add to the suspense, making it unclear how Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches."
