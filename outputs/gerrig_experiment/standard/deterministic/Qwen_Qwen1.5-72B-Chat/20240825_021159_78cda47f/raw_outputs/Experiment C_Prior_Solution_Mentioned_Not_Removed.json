"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n5. Moderately likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nIn the passage, Bond manages to create a distraction and attempts to escape, but is quickly apprehended by a formidable guard.
