"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n5. Moderately likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nIn the passage, Bond manages to create a distraction and attempts to escape, but is quickly apprehended by a formidable guard. The description of the tense situation, the use of darkness, and the introduction of the menacing character Crushak contribute to a high level of suspense. However, Bond's resourcefulness and past escape from similar situations suggest a moderate likelihood that he will find a way to escape, even though the odds seem stacked against him at the moment."
