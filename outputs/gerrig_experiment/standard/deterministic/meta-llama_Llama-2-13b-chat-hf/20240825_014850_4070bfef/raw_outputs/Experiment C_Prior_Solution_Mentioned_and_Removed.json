"  Based on the passage, here are my answers to the two questions:\n\n**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**\n\nI would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as \"Not very likely\". The passage states that Crushak, the large and ugly man, is \"devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life\" and has orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak to him. Additionally, Bond is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which suggests that he is in a vulnerable position.\n\n**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**\n\nI would rate the suspense level of this passage as \"Very suspenseful\". The passage sets up a tense situation where Bond is captured and helpless, with Crushak and Blofeld intent on keeping him captive. The use of the large bird crashing into the wall of glass and the subsequent darkness in the office adds to the suspense, as it creates an element of unpredictability and increases the sense of danger for Bond. The passage also raises the stakes"
