" Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld at this moment (Option 1). The situation appears to be quite dire for Bond as he is currently a prisoner in Blofeld's office, surrounded by his henchmen. The passage is also quite suspenseful as the stakes are high for Bond and the outcome is uncertain (Option 5). The tension is built up through the description of Blofeld's reaction to Bond's actions and the use of physical restraints on Bond."
