"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past and has attempted to escape, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation seems dire, but Bond's history of escaping from tight spots suggests that there is still a possibility of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The description of the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh adds to the sense of physical danger, and the threat of Crushak's devotion to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life creates a sense of psychological tension. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from this situation."
