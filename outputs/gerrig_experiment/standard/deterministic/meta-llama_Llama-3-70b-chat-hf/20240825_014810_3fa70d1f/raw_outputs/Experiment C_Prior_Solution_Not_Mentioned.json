"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation looks dire, but Bond's past escapades suggest that he might still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond facing off against Blofeld and his henchman. The sudden interruption by the bird, followed by Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture, keeps the reader on edge. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and suspense."
