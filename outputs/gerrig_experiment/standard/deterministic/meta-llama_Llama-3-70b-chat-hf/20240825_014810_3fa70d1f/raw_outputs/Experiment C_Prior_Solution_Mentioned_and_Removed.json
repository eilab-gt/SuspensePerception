"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past and has attempted to escape, he is currently tied up and under close guard, making escape seem difficult. However, Bond's history of escaping from tight spots suggests that it's not impossible.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up, and Crushak being instructed to shoot him if he even attempts to speak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding."
