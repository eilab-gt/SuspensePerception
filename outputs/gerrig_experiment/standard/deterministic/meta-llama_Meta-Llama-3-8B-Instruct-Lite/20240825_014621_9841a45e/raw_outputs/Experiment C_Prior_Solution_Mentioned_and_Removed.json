"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being tied up by Crushak and under the watchful eye of Blofeld, who has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him. The passage suggests that Bond is at a significant disadvantage and may not be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and danger around Bond's situation. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from his predicament, and the threat of Crushak's gun and Blofeld's orders to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him creates a sense of urgency and danger. The use of descriptive language, such as \"very large and very ugly\" to describe Crushak, also adds to the sense of foreboding and unease."
