"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and Crushak, and he is being held in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms, which is a rather secure and painful predicament. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape in the near future.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of suspenseful elements, including the sudden appearance of a bird crashing into the wall, the distraction it creates, and the subsequent events that unfold, including Bond's capture and the menacing presence of Crushak. The use of dark and ominous language, such as \"devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life\" and \"contemplate your rude behavior\", adds to the sense of tension and foreboding, making the passage very suspenseful."
