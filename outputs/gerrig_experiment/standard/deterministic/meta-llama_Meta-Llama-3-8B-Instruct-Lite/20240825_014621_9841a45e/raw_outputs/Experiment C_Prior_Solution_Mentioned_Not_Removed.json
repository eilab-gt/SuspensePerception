"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being tied up by Crushak and at the mercy of Blofeld. The fact that Crushak is described as \"devoted to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life\" suggests that he is a formidable opponent, and Bond's chances of escape seem slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of suspenseful elements, including the sudden interruption by the bird, the darkening of the room, and the appearance of Crushak, a large and ugly man. The description of Bond's predicament, being tied up and at the mercy of his captors, is also very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and foreboding, making it very suspenseful."
