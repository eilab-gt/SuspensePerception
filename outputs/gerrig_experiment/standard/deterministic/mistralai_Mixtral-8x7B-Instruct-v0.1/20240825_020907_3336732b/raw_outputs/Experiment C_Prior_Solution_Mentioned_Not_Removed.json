" ***Answer 1:*** 3. Slightly likely\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that Bond has tried to escape and failed, resulting in him being tied up. However, Bond has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations, so there is still a chance he may escape again. But given the current circumstances, it seems slightly unlikely.\n\n***Answer 2:*** 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful as Bond is in a dangerous situation, facing a powerful enemy who has captured him and is determined to keep him captive. The tension is heightened by the presence of the large and ugly man, Crushak, who is tasked with guarding Bond and has already shown his willingness to use force. The fact that Bond was able to outwit Blofeld's guard in the past also adds to the suspense, as the reader wonders if he will be able to do so again."
