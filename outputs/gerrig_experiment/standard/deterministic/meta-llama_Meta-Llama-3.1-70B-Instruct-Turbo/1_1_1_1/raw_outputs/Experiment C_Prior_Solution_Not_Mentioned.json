"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Bond has been caught and tied up, he has already shown his resourcefulness and quick thinking by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall. This suggests that he may be able to find another opportunity to escape. However, he is currently at a disadvantage, tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, so it's not a certainty that he will escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful, as Bond is in a precarious situation, tied up and at the mercy of his enemies. The fact that Blofeld has left him with the menacing Mr. Crushak, who seems eager to eliminate Bond, adds to the tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape. The passage effectively creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, making it very suspenseful."
