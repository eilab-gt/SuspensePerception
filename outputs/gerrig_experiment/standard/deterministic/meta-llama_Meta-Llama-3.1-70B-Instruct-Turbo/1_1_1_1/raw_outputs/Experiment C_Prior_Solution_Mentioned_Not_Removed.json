"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 6. Very likely.\n\nAlthough Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, the passage suggests that Bond is a resourceful and cunning character who has escaped from Blofeld's clutches before. The fact that Blofeld mentions this previous escape and implies that Crushak is a more reliable guard suggests that Bond may still find a way to outsmart them.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 7. Extremely suspenseful.\n\nThe passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, from the sudden crash of the bird into the glass wall to the revelation of the ugly and menacing Mr. Crushak. The use of dark and light to create a sense of atmosphere, combined with the physical danger and pain inflicted on Bond, creates a sense of high stakes and tension. The fact that Bond is tied up and at the mercy of his captors also raises the suspense and creates a sense of urgency."
