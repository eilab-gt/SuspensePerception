"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, with no obvious means of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"very large and very ugly man\" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond next, which adds to the suspense."
