"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, he is currently tied up and under close guard, making escape seem difficult. However, Bond's history of escaping from tight spots suggests that there is still a possibility of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and threatened by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The fact that Bond is tied up and unable to speak also raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency."
