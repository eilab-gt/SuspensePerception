"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown some resourcefulness in the past, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. It's not impossible that he might find a way to escape, but it seems unlikely given his current situation.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond trying to escape and Blofeld's henchman thwarting his attempts. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"large and very ugly man\" and the \"painfully\" twisting wire, adds to the sense of danger and suspense. The cliffhanger ending, with Bond tied up and at Blofeld's mercy, also leaves the reader wondering what will happen next."
