"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?\"***\nI would choose answer 3. Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown some agility and quick thinking in his attempt to escape, he has been caught and is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond's ability to move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond trying to escape and being caught, and the threat of violence is palpable. The use of words like \"whistle of pain\", \"slammed\", \"crashed\", and \"barked\" adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape."
