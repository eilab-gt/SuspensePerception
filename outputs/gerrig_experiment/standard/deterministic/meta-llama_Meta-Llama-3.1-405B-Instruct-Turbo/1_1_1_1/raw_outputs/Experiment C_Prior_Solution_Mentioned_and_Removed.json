"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would rate this as a 3. Slightly likely. While Bond has shown his resourcefulness in taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird and attempting to escape, he is now tied up with piano wire and being guarded by a large and ugly man with a gun. The situation looks bleak, but Bond's past experiences and skills suggest that he may still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond's failed escape attempt and subsequent capture and restraint. The introduction of the menacing and ugly Crushak adds to the sense of menace, and Blofeld's calm and collected demeanor makes him a formidable villain. The use of sensory details, such as the pain caused by the piano wire, also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere."
