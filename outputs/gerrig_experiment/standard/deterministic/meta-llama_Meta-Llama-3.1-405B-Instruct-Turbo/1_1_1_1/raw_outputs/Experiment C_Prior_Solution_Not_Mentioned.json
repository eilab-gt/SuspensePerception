"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would rate this as a 3. Slightly likely. While Bond has shown his resourcefulness in attempting to escape, he is now tied up with piano wire and being guarded by the large and ugly Mr. Crushak. However, given Bond's history of escaping from difficult situations, it's still possible that he might find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond facing a life-threatening situation and being subjected to physical pain. The description of Crushak's ugliness and menacing behavior adds to the sense of menace, and the fact that Bond is now tied up and at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about how he will escape. The passage effectively builds suspense and creates a sense of uncertainty about Bond's fate."
