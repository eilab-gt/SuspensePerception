"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would rate this as a 4. Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has shown his resourcefulness in creating a distraction and attempting to escape, he is now tied up with piano wire and being guarded by a large and ugly man with a gun. The situation looks bleak, but Bond's past experiences and skills suggest that he may still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would rate this as a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond's attempted escape, the sudden appearance of the large and ugly man, and the painful and menacing use of piano wire to restrain Bond. The dialogue from Blofeld and the description of Crushak's appearance and actions add to the sense of menace and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this predicament, and what will happen to him next."
