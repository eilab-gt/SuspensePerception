"Here are my answers based on the passage:\n\n**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"**\n\n**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**\n\n* **Reasoning:** While Bond shows some cleverness by using the distraction to attack Blofeld, he's quickly subdued and tightly bound.  Crushak seems formidable and has orders to shoot.  However, this is James Bond, known for his resourcefulness and ability to get out of tight spots. It's unlikely he'll give up easily.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n\n\n**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**\n\n* **Reasoning:** The passage builds tension through several elements: \n    * Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted.\n    * The introduction of the menacing Crushak.\n    * The detailed description of Bond's painful binding.\n    * Blofeld's clear threat to Bond's life.\n    * The passage ends with Bond in a vulnerable position, creating a sense of anticipation and worry about his fate. \n\n\n\n"
