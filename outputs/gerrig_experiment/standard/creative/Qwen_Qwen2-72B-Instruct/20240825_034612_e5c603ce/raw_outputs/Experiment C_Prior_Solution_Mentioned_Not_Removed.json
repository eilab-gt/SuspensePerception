"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\nGiven the passage, it is unclear whether Bond will escape from Blofeld. Bond was able to take advantage of a distraction, but he was stopped by Crushak, who tied him up in a way that suggests it will be difficult for Bond to escape. The passage does not give enough information to predict Bond's likelihood of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\nThe passage is suspenseful because Bond is in a dangerous situation and the outcome is uncertain. The tension is heightened by the unexpected distraction of the bird crashing into the window, the sudden action of Bond trying to escape, and the appearance of Crushak with his gun. The details of Crushak binding Bond with piano wire also add to the suspense because it suggests that Bond will have difficulty escaping."
