Not very likely\n\nThe passage describes Bond being tied up in a chair with piano wire, and Blofeld mentioning that Crushak will be responsible for him this time. This suggests that Bond is at a significant disadvantage and it's unlikely he will be able to escape on his own.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and Blofeld's words hint that Bond's previous escapes will not be repeated.
