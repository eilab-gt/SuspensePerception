"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently tied up and pinned in place by Crushak, and Blofeld seems to have taken control of the situation. Additionally, Crushak is a large and ugly man who seems devoted to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life, which makes it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper trapped and unable to escape. The sudden interruption of the bird crashing into the glass wall, the fight to try and escape, and the painful binding of Bond's arms all contribute to a sense of high stakes and uncertainty, making the passage very suspenseful."
