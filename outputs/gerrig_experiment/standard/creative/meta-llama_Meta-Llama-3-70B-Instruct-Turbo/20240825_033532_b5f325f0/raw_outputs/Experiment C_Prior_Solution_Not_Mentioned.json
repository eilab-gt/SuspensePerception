"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would answer: 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond has already tried to escape once and was caught, he is a resourceful and skilled spy, and it's likely that he will try to find another opportunity to escape. However, he is currently tied up and being guarded by a large and ugly man, which makes his chances of escape more difficult.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"large and very ugly man\" and the \"painfully\" tight piano wire, adds to the sense of menace and creates a feeling of suspense. The fact that Bond has already tried to escape once and failed makes the situation feel more dire, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament."
