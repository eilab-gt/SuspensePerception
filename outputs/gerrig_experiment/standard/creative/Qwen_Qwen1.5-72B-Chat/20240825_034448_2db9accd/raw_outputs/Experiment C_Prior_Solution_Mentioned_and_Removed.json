"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n5. Moderately likely\n\nDespite being captured and tied up, Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past and has managed to escape similar situations. The fact that he created a distraction and attempted to disarm Blofeld indicates that he is actively trying to escape. However, with the introduction of the intimidating and seemingly competent guard Crushak, the likelihood of escape is not certain but still moderate.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe scene is filled with tension, starting with Blofeld's ominous comment and the unexpected entry of the large bird, which leads to a moment of potential escape for Bond. The subsequent confrontation with Crushak and the painful binding of Bond create a sense of immediacy and danger, making the passage quite suspenseful. The threat of death if Bond even tries to speak to Crushak raises the stakes and adds to the suspense."
