However, since he is now disarmed and in the hands of his captors, the likelihood of an immediate escape is reduced.\n\nAnswer: 3. Slightly likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nThe passage is filled with action, a desperate attempt to escape, and the immediate thwarting of that attempt. The uncertainty of Bond\u2019s fate, the quick thinking and action on both sides, and the tension between Bond and his captors make it quite suspenseful.\n\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful"
