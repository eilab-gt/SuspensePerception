"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThis answer seems most fitting, as Bond is being held captive by a very large and ugly man named Crushak, who is instructed to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him. Additionally, Crushak has wrapped piano wire around the chair's corners and Bond's arms, making it less likely for Bond to break free.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n5. Moderately suspenseful\n\nThis answer seems most fitting, as the passage creates a sense of tension and foreboding. Blofeld's men have been successful in capturing Bond, and Crushak's menacing presence and orders to shoot Bond if he speaks to him create a sense of danger. However, the passage also hints at Bond's resourcefulness and determination, which suggests that the story may still have a twist or turn in store."
