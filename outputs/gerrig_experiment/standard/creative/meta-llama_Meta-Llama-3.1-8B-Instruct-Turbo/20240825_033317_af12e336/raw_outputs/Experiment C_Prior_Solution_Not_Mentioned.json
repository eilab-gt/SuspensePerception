"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBond is tied up with piano wire, which is a very effective way to immobilize someone. Additionally, he is being guarded by a large and formidable man named Crushak, who is clearly devoted to eliminating Bond. The fact that the room is dark and there is a gun pointing at Bond's chest also makes escape seem unlikely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is trapped and tied up. The use of words like \"crashed\", \"distraction\", \"gun shot\", and \"painfully\" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The character of Crushak is also portrayed as a menacing figure, which adds to the suspense. Overall, the passage creates a sense of high stakes and danger, making it very suspenseful."
