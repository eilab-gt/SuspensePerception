"  Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\n\nBased on the passage, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. Bond has already been tied up by Crushak and Blofeld has made it clear that Crushak will be responsible for keeping him captive. The passage also mentions that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him, which further suggests that Bond will not be able to escape. Therefore, the answer is (6) Very likely.\n\nQuestion 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\n\nThis passage is moderately suspenseful. It creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is trapped by Blofeld and Crushak, and the threat of violence is present throughout the passage. The use of sensory details, such as the large bird crashing into the wall of glass and the dark office, adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not build to a climactic moment, which keeps it from being extremely suspenseful. Therefore, the answer is (5) Moderately suspenseful."
