"I can answer your questions based on the passage.\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nI would rate it a 3. Slightly likely. While Bond was able to create a temporary distraction and attempt to escape, he was quickly thwarted by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, and is now tied up with piano wire. However, given Bond's resourcefulness and experience, it's still possible that he might find a way to escape, albeit a difficult and uncertain one.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would rate it a 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond in a precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his menacing henchman. The use of sensory details, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the pain of the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The uncertainty of Bond's fate and the threat of violence from Crushak and Blofeld keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story."
