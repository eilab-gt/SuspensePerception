"Based on the passage, I'd answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Bond is currently a prisoner and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, Bond's agility and quick thinking in attempting to escape and doing minimal damage to himself suggest that he might still have a chance to escape. However, the situation seems to be stacked against him, with Le Chiffre and his men in control.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful, as Bond is in a dangerous situation and is trying to escape. The use of words like \"slammed\", \"whistled\", and \"barked\" creates a sense of urgency and tension, and the reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape or if he will be captured and harmed. The sudden twists and turns in the passage, such as Bond's attempted escape and the Corsican's quick reaction, add to the suspense."
