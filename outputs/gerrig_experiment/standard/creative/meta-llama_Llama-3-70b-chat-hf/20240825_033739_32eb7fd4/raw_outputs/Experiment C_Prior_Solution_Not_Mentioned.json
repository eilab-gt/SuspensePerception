"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has managed to cause a distraction and momentarily gain the upper hand, he has been quickly overpowered by Blofeld's henchman, Mr. Crushak, and is now securely tied up. However, Bond's resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet suggest that he may still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The sudden introduction of the bird crashing into the glass wall adds an element of surprise, and the descriptions of Bond's struggles to escape and the painful wire restraints create a sense of urgency and fear for his safety. The passage effectively builds suspense and leaves the reader wondering what will happen next."
