" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nBond has been captured and is bound to a chair, so it seems unlikely that he will escape immediately. However, given Bond's resourcefulness and previous experience with Blofeld, it is not completely impossible that he may find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful due to the dangerous situation Bond finds himself in and the threat of violence from Blofeld and his henchman. The unfolding events, such as the distraction with the bird, Bond's attempt to escape, and the warning from Blofeld, create a sense of tension and anticipation."
