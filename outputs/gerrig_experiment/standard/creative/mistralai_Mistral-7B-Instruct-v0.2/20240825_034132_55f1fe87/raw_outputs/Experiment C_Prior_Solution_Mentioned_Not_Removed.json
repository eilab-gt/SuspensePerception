" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n2. Somewhat likely\n3. Slightly likely\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n5. Moderately unlikely\n6. Very unlikely\n7. Extremely unlikely\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, it appears that Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his associate, Crushak. The passage describes how Blofeld and Crushak have taken Bond into custody and bound him to a chair using piano wire. These actions suggest that Bond's chances of escaping are relatively low, especially given that he has already been held captive by Blofeld once before and was unable to escape at that time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5. Moderately unlikely or 6. Very unlikely, depending on how optimistic one wants to be about Bond's chances.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n1. Not very suspenseful\n2. Somewhat suspenseful\n3. Slightly suspenseful\n4. Neutral"
