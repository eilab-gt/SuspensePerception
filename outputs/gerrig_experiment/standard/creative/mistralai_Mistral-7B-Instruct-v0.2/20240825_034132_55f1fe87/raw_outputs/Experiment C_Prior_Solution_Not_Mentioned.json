" Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that the situation is quite dire for Bond and his chances of escaping are not very likely. He is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and Crushak, who have him tied up in a chair. The environment does not appear conducive to an escape, and the characters have shown no indication of releasing Bond willingly. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 would be \"Not very likely.\"\n\nAs for Question 2, the passage is certainly suspenseful due to the danger Bond is in and the uncertainty of his situation. The fact that he is a prisoner of Blofeld, a criminal mastermind, adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not reveal any imminent threats or cliffhanger moments, so it might not be considered extremely suspenseful. Therefore, the answer to Question 2 would be \"Moderately suspenseful.\""
