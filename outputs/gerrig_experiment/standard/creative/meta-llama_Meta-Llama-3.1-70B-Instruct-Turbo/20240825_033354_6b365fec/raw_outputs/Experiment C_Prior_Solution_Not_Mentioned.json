"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would answer: 5. Moderately likely.\n\nWhile Bond has been caught and tied up, the fact that he was able to think on his feet and create a distraction earlier in the passage suggests that he may still have a chance to escape. Additionally, Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, which increases the likelihood of his escape. However, the presence of the formidable Mr. Crushak and the fact that Bond is currently restrained make it less than extremely likely.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful.\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the use of action, danger, and uncertainty. The sudden introduction of the bird crashing into the window, followed by Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture, keeps the reader on edge. The presence of the menacing Mr. Crushak and the painful piano wire restraints add to the sense of danger and suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next to Bond."
