"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nI would choose 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and Crushak, and they seem to have him under control. The passage describes Bond being forced into a chair and having piano wire wrapped around his arms, making it difficult for him to escape. The tone of the passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious and helpless position.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak. The use of words like \"pointing a gun at him\", \"stumble backwards\", \"gun shot up into the air\", and \"painfully\" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel that Bond is in a precarious situation. The fact that Bond is being tied up and helpless only adds to the sense of suspense. The passage effectively builds tension and keeps the reader engaged, making it very suspenseful."
