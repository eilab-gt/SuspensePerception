"Based on the passage, I'd be happy to answer your questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his large and ugly associate Crushak. Bond is tied up with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Crushak is described as being \"devoted to eliminating irritations\" from Blofeld's life, implying that he may be more than willing to keep Bond captive. The situation doesn't seem very promising for Bond's escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is in a vulnerable position, being held captive by a dangerous and ruthless individual. The description of Crushak as \"ugly\" and \"large\" adds to the sense of foreboding, and the mention of the guard who died in an \"automobile accident\" after being involved in a previous capture of Bond implies that there may be a deadly outcome."
