"Based on this passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has already shown some resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction and trying to escape, he has been overpowered and tied up by Crushak. It seems like the odds are against him, but it's still possible that he might find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond trying to escape and being thwarted by Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as \"contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile\" and \"each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh\", adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The threat of death and the ominous tone of Blofeld's words also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere."
