"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nI would answer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Bond has been outsmarted by Blofeld and is currently tied up, we know that Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent who has managed to escape from sticky situations before. There's a good chance that he will find a way to escape, but it's not a sure thing given his current predicament.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is quite suspenseful because Bond is in a dangerous and precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The addition of the ugly and intimidating Mr. Crushak adds to the tension, and the description of Bond being tied up with piano wire creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage ends with Blofeld leaving Bond to contemplate his situation, leaving the reader in suspense and eager to find out what will happen next."
