"Here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?\"***\n\nI would choose answer 2: Somewhat likely. Although Bond has been caught and is at a disadvantage, his quick thinking and resourcefulness (as shown by his attempt to move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket) suggest that he may still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and violent action, with Bond and Vesper in a desperate situation. The sudden twists and turns, such as the Corsican's quick reaction to Bond's attack, add to the sense of suspense and uncertainty."
