"Here are my answers based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 1: Not very likely. The passage describes Bond being tied up securely with piano wire, and Blofeld has taken measures to prevent him from escaping again. The situation seems quite dire for Bond.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with a bird crashing into the wall, a gun going off, and Bond trying to escape, only to be caught and tied up. The situation is precarious, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next. The introduction of the menacing Mr. Crushak and Blofeld's ominous words add to the suspense."
