"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?\"***\nI would choose answer 2. Somewhat likely. Although Bond is in a precarious situation, he has already shown his resourcefulness by trying to make a move against the gunmen and has managed to subtly move his fountain pen deeper into his pocket, suggesting that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond trying to make a desperate escape attempt, getting caught, and then being searched and disarmed. The scene is fast-paced and intense, with a sense of danger and uncertainty hanging over Bond's fate. The fact that Le Chiffre seems to be one step ahead of Bond, anticipating his moves, adds to the sense of suspense."
