" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nBased on the passage, it is uncertain how likely it is for Bond to escape from Blofeld. Although Bond has demonstrated quick thinking and has attempted to escape, he is now bound by piano wire to a chair and being guarded by Crushak, who is described as very large and very ugly. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if Bond will be able to outsmart Crushak or if he has any other means of escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful as it describes Bond's attempt to escape from Blofeld's office and his subsequent capture. The use of descriptive language to describe the setting, such as the large bird crashing into the wall of glass and the darkness of the office, adds to the tension. The introduction of Crushak as a formidable opponent also contributes to the suspense, as it is uncertain if Bond will be able to escape from him"
