"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBond is currently tied up by Crushak, and Blofeld has taken Bond's gun away. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated his intention to leave Bond with Crushak to contemplate his rude behavior. This suggests that Bond's options for escape are limited, making it unlikely that he will escape from Blofeld.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. Blofeld's men are clearly hostile and intent on harming Bond, and Bond is trapped and unable to escape. The description of the setting, including the dark office and the pain caused by the piano wire, adds to the sense of foreboding and danger."
