Blofeld has also introduced a new, powerful gunman, Crushak, who seems dedicated to eliminating any potential escape attempts. The situation appears dire for Bond, making it unlikely that he will escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and confinement for Bond.
