"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?\"***\n1. Not very likely (Based on the description, Bond has been captured, disarmed, and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, making a straight escape seem unlikely.)\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful (The action-packed description, with Bond attempting to subdue his captors and the unexpected moves from both Bond and Le Chiffre, keeps the tension high.)"
