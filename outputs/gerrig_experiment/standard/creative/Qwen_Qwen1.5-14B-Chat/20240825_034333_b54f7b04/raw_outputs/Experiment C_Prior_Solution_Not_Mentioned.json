"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"**\n1. Not very likely\n\nFrom the description provided, it seems that Bond has been caught off guard and is now restrained in a wooden armchair with piano wire. He faces a menacing character, Crushak, who is guarding the door, indicating a difficult situation and little immediate hope for an escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it builds tension with Bond's sudden action, the distraction caused by the bird, and the escalating confrontation with Blofeld and Crushak. The description of the man and his weapon, as well as the binding method used, adds to the feeling of danger and uncertainty for Bond's fate. The plot twist and the anticipation of Bond's next move keep the suspense high."
