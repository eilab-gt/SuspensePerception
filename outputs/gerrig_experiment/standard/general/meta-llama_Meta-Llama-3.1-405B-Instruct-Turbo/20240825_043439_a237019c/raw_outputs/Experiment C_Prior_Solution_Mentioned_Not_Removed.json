"**Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"**\n\nI would rate this as 5. Moderately likely. While Bond is currently in a precarious situation, tied up with piano wire and guarded by the formidable Crushak, he has already demonstrated his resourcefulness by attempting to escape and causing a distraction. Given Bond's history of escaping from difficult situations, it's likely that he will find a way to escape again.\n\n**Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"**\n\nI would rate this as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond facing a formidable foe in Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of vivid language, such as the description of Crushak as \"very large and very ugly\", adds to the sense of menace. The fact that Bond is tied up and at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of vulnerability, making the situation feel more suspenseful. The mention of the previous guard's fate also adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes for Bond's escape."
