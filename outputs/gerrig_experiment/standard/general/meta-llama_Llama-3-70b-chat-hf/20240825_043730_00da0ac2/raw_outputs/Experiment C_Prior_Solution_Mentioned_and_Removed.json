Although Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation seems dire, but Bond's past escapades suggest that he might still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The threat of being shot if he even attempts to speak adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape this predicament."
