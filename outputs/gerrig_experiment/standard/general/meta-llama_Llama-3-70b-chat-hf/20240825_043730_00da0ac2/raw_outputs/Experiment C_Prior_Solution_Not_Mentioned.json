"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past and has attempted to escape, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The situation seems precarious for Bond, but it's possible that he might find a way to escape or be rescued.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the \"painfully\" twisting piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape."
