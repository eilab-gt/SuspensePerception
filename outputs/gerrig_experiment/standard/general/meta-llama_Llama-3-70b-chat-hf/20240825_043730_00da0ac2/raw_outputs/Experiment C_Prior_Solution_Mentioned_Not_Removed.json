"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction and attempting to escape, he has been caught and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The situation seems dire, but Bond's past successes in escaping from captivity suggest that there is still a possibility he might find a way out.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the initial confrontation between Bond and Blofeld to the sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the wall, and finally to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's brutal methods of restraining Bond adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder how Bond will manage to escape this time."
