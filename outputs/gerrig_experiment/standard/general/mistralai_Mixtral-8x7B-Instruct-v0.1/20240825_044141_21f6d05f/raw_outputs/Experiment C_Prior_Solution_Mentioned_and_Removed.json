Bond is now tightly bound to a chair with piano wire, leaving him at the mercy of his captors. While it's not impossible for Bond to escape, it seems unlikely given his current circumstances.\n\n***Answer 2:*** 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful due to the constant tension and danger that Bond finds himself in.
