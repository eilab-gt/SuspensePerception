Additionally, Le Chiffre has taken Bond's fountain pen away, which could be seen as a way to prevent Bond from using it to write a message or escape plan.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nThe passage is moderately suspenseful. There is tension in the scene as Bond is being held captive by two gunmen and Le Chiffre is ordering them to search him.
