***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given the information in the passage, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre's trap and is now a prisoner. The Corsican gunman has successfully caught Bond's shoe and twisted it, causing Bond to crash to the ground. The two gunmen have then stripped Bond of his revolver and fountain pen, leaving him defenseless. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Given the information in the passage, I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tense moments, including Bond's sudden decision to act, the Corsican's quick and precise shot at Bond's shoe, and the subsequent search of Bond by the gunmen. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty and danger, as Bond is caught off guard and left defenseless. The use of phrases such as "With a backward kick" and "Like lightning" adds to the sense of urgency and tension, making the passage very suspenseful.
