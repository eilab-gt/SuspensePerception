Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The reason for this answer is that Bond has been caught and tied up by Crushak, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Bond will be left with Crushak to contemplate his behavior. Additionally, the fact that Bond was caught by two gunmen and is now tied up in a chair suggests that he is at a significant disadvantage.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense situation where Bond is caught and tied up by a large and intimidating man, and is being held captive by a villainous character who has a history of being ruthless and cunning. The use of vivid descriptions and the action-packed sequence of events creates a sense of tension and suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
