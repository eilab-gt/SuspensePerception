***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

This answer is chosen because Bond has just been caught off guard by Le Chiffre and his men, and has been disarmed. He has been searched thoroughly, and his pocket comb, which could potentially be used as a makeshift tool, has been taken away from him. Additionally, Bond is described as feeling "puny and impotent", which suggests that he is at a disadvantage and unlikely to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

This answer is chosen because the passage is full of sudden and unexpected events, such as the door bursting in and the gunmen attacking Bond. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and the tension builds as Bond tries to defend himself and is eventually overpowered. The use of words like "barked", "roughly", and "patted down" also adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
