***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Considering the passage, Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his large and ugly gunman, Crushak. Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him, and Bond's arms are being tightly pinned in place by piano wire. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's captivity. Therefore, the answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is suspenseful because it describes Bond's precarious situation, where he is being held captive by a ruthless and cunning adversary, Blofeld. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful twisting of piano wire around Bond's arms, creates a sense of tension and danger. Additionally, the mention of a previous guard dying in an automobile accident implies that Blofeld is capable of eliminating anyone who gets in his way. This creates a sense of foreboding and raises questions about Bond's fate, making the passage suspenseful. Therefore, the answer is:

7. Extremely suspenseful
