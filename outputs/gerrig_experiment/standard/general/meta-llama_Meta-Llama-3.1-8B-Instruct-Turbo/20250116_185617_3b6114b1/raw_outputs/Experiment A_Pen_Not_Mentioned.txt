**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

This answer is based on the fact that Bond has just been caught by Le Chiffre's trap, and he has been overpowered by the Corsican's quick reflexes. The two gunmen have also disarmed Bond, and Le Chiffre is now in control. Given this situation, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.
