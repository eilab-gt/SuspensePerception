Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 
1. Not very likely

Bond is being held by two gunmen and is unarmed after having his revolver and fountain pen taken away. His attempt to escape was thwarted by the Corsican, and he is now being searched. This suggests that his chances of escape are low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"*** 
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being held captive and is trying to escape. The quick movements and actions of the characters create a sense of urgency and danger, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen next.
