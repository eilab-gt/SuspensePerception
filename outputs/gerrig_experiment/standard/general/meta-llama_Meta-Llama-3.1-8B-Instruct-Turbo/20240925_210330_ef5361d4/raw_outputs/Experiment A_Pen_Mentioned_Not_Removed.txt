**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage indicates that Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. The situation seems dire for Bond, and it's unlikely that he will escape easily. The fact that he was caught by Le Chiffre's trap and that he was disarmed by the Corsican suggests that his chances of escape are low.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the tension builds as the Corsican disarms him and Taylor orders his search. The use of descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket," adds to the suspense and creates a sense of tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape.
