***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond has shown some resourcefulness and agility, he is currently at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The situation seems precarious, but Bond's skills and abilities are not explicitly stated, leaving the outcome uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond in a dangerous situation and trying to think on his feet. The use of action verbsed language ("hurl himself", "whistle of pain", "slammed himself back", "crashed to the ground") adds to the sense of intensity and drama. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or outsmart his captors.
