I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional text you provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. However, the passage doesn't provide enough information to suggest that escape is likely or unlikely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates tension by putting Bond and Vesper in a dangerous situation, but it's a relatively brief and straightforward setup. The suspense is moderate because the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, but the passage doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or urgency.
