I'll answer the questions based on the passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Bond being captured and disarmed, but it's a James Bond novel, and we expect Bond to find a way to escape. However, at this point in the story, it's unclear how he will manage to do so.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond trying to escape and being caught, and the sense of danger and uncertainty is palpable. The description of the fight and the capture is vivid and engaging, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond.
