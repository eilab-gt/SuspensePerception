***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, the current situation seems quite precarious, with Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. However, Bond's resourcefulness and cunning are well-established, so it's hard to rule out the possibility of an escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The description of Crushak's ugly appearance and the painful binding of Bond's arms with piano wire adds to the sense of menace. The reference to Bond's previous escape and the threat of Crushak's responsibility for Bond's fate also raises the stakes and creates a sense of uncertainty, making the passage very suspenseful.
