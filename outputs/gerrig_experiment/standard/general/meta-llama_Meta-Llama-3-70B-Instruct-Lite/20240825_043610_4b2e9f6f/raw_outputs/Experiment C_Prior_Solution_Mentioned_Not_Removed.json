"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has managed to cause some chaos and distraction, he has ultimately been overpowered and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. While Bond has a history of escaping from difficult situations, the current circumstances seem to be against him.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond trying to escape and Blofeld's henchman trying to capture him. The sudden interruption by the bird crashing into the wall adds to the sense of surprise and unpredictability. The description of Crushak's ugly face and Bond's painful situation also adds to the sense of danger and suspense."
