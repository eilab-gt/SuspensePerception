"Based on this passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose answer 3. Slightly likely. Although Bond has managed to cause a brief distraction and make an attempt to escape, he has been quickly caught and securely tied up by Crushak. The situation looks grim for Bond, but given his past history of escaping from tight spots, it's not impossible that he might find a way out.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond making a bold attempt to escape and being thwarted by Crushak. The description of Crushak's ugly face and his menacing behavior adds to the sense of danger and foreboding. The fact that Bond is now securely tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, making the passage very suspenseful."
