"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n5. Moderately likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nIn the passage, Bond manages to create a distraction and attempts to escape, but is quickly apprehended by a formidable guard, Crushak. The situation seems dire, with Bond being tightly bound and under threat of immediate death if he tries to communicate. However, given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping tight spots, it's moderately likely that he will find a way to escape. The passage is certainly suspenseful, as it builds tension with the unexpected bird attack, the struggle with Blofeld, and the introduction of the menacing Crushak."
