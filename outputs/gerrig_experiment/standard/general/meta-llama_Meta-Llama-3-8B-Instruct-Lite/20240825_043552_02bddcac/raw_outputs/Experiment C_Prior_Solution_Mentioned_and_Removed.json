"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being tied up by Crushak and being threatened to be shot if he tries to speak to him. The fact that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life also suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tension and suspense, with Bond being trapped, tied up, and threatened with death. The sudden interruption of the bird crashing into the wall, the darkness, and the large and ugly man, Crushak, all contribute to a sense of foreboding and danger, making the passage very suspenseful."
