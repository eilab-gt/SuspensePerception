Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, with no clear way out. He's been captured, tied up, and left with a large and ugly man, Crushak, who is tasked with eliminating him. The situation doesn't look promising for Bond's escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a turning point in the story where Bond's situation has taken a dark and dire turn.

The use of descriptive language, such as \"very large and very ugly\" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of foreboding and unease, making the passage extremely suspenseful."
