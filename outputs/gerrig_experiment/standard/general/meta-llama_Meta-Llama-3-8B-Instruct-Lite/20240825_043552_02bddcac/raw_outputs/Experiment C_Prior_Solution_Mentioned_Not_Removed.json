"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, with no clear means of escape. The fact that Crushak has tied Bond up using piano wire, making it difficult for him to move, suggests that escape may be a significant challenge.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes Bond's capture and confinement, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the crash of the bird into the wall of glass, and the menacing tone of Blofeld and Crushak, creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The reader is left feeling on edge, wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape."
