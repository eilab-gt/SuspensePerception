Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped, and despite his agility and quick thinking, he is unable to escape from Le Chiffre and his henchmen. He is outnumbered and outgunned, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from their clutches.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of tension and danger from the very beginning. The sudden and unexpected arrival of the gunmen, the physical confrontation between Bond and the henchmen, and Bond's sense of impotence and vulnerability all contribute to a sense of high stakes and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors.
