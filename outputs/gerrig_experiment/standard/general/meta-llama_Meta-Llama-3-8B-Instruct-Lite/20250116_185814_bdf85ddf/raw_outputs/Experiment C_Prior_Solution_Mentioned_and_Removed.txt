Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, with multiple guns pointed at him and being restrained with piano wire. This is a very unfavorable situation for Bond, and it's unlikely that he will be able to escape without some kind of outside intervention or a clever plan.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it's clear that Bond is in a dangerous and precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape or what will happen to him. The use of descriptive language, such as "large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the tension and unease. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is at the mercy of his captors, with guns pointed at him and being restrained with painful wire, creates a sense of urgency and danger that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
