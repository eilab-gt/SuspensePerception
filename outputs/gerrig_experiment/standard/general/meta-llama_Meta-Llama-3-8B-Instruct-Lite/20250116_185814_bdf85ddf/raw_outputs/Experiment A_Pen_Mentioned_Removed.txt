Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a difficult situation, having been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being searched, which makes it unlikely that he will escape easily.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the use of words like "silently", "whistle of pain", and "brusquely" adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty, as the reader is unsure of what will happen to Bond next. The use of short sentences and the rapid pace of the action also adds to the suspense, making it a very suspenseful passage.
