Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has just been caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and is being disarmed and searched. This suggests that his escape is unlikely at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashed to the ground", and "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty, as the reader is unsure of how Bond will escape or what will happen to him next.
