Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and pinned down by piano wire, with a large and ugly man, Crushak, holding him in place. Blofeld has also stated that Crushak is there to eliminate any irritations from his life, implying that Bond's chances of escape are slim. Therefore, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, adds to the sense of unease, and Blofeld's cold and menacing tone suggests that Bond is in grave danger. The use of words like "eliminating" and "contemplate" also adds to the sense of foreboding, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
