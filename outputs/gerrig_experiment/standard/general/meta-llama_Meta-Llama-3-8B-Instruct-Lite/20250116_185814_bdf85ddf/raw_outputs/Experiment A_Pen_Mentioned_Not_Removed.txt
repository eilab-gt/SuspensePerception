Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and has been disarmed. This makes it unlikely that he will escape in the immediate future.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful as it describes Bond's attempt to escape and his subsequent capture, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next.
