"Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: \"Not very likely\". Bond is currently pinned down by piano wire and has a large and ugly gunman, Crushak, watching him. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him, making it seem unlikely that Bond will be able to escape in the near future.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: \"Very suspenseful\". The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is trapped and helpless, with a menacing figure like Crushak watching him. The darkening of the room and the sudden appearance of the large bird add to the sense of surprise and unpredictability, making it a very suspenseful passage."
