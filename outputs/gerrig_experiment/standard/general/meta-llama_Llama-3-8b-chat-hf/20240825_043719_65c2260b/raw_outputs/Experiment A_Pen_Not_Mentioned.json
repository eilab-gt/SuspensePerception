Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without a plan or some kind of assistance.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his gunmen.
