"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nI would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently pinned down by piano wire and being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation seems dire, and Bond's previous attempts to escape have been unsuccessful. Blofeld also seems to be taking precautions to ensure Bond's capture this time around.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkening of the room, and the introduction of Crushak all contribute to a sense of urgency and danger. The passage also raises questions about Bond's ability to escape and the consequences of his failure to do so, making it a thrilling and suspenseful read."
