"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is now a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, with Bond's arms pinned to the chair using piano wire. This makes it difficult for Bond to escape, and Blofeld seems to have the upper hand.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The sudden arrival of the bird, the distraction, and Bond's attempt to escape are all suspenseful elements that keep the reader engaged and worried about Bond's fate. The description of Crushak's ugly face and Blofeld's menacing tone also adds to the suspense."
