"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 5. Moderately likely. While Bond has been caught and tied up, he is a resourceful and skilled secret agent, and it's likely that he will find a way to escape. However, the fact that he is currently at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, makes it uncertain.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the bird crashing into the glass wall to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The fact that Bond is now tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, making the passage very suspenseful."
