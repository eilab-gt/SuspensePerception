"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Bond has managed to create a brief distraction and attempt to escape, he is ultimately thwarted by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, and is now tied up and at their mercy. However, Bond's history of outwitting his captors (as mentioned by Blofeld) suggests that he may still have a chance to escape, even if it's not immediately apparent.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is full of tense moments, from the sudden crash of the bird into the glass wall to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The presence of guns, the menacing figure of Crushak, and the painful binding of Bond with piano wire all contribute to a sense of danger and urgency. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of his captors and is forbidden from speaking to Crushak adds to the sense of suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next."
