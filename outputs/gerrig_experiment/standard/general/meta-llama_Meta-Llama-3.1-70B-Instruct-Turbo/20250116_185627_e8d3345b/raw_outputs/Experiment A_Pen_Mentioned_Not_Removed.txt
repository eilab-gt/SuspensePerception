***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. 

Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre, his actions in the passage show that he is resourceful, agile, and determined to escape or cause damage. The fact that he was able to move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket without being noticed suggests that he may have a plan or a tool that could aid him in his escape. Additionally, Bond's character as a secret agent implies that he has skills and training that would increase his chances of escaping from captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful.

The passage creates a high level of tension and suspense by describing Bond's desperate attempt to follow Vesper and his subsequent capture by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of action words like "hurled," "slammed," and "twisted" creates a sense of urgency and violence. The fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes. The passage also ends with Le Chiffre
