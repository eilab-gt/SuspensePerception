***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer this question with option 6: Very likely.

The passage suggests that Bond is a resourceful and skilled operative who has managed to escape from Blofeld's captivity before. Although he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, the fact that he was able to create a distraction and attempt to escape earlier in the passage implies that he is still a threat to Blofeld and may be able to find another opportunity to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer this question with option 7: Extremely suspenseful.

The passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, from the bird crashing into the glass wall to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The fact that Bond is now tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak creates a sense of danger and urgency, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape this time. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, adding to the overall sense of suspense and tension.
