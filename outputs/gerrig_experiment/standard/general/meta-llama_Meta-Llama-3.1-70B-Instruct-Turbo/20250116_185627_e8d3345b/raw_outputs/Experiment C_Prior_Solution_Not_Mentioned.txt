***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the situation, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping is 'Very likely' (6). Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, the passage suggests that Bond is resourceful and has already managed to create a distraction and attempt to escape. Given Bond's character and the typical progression of James Bond stories, it's likely that he will find a way to escape from his predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 'Extremely suspenseful' (7). The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of a sudden distraction (the bird crashing into the wall) and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The fact that Bond is then caught and tied up, with the threat of harm or elimination looming, adds to the suspense and leaves the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape.
