***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given the passage, I would choose option 6: Very likely. Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, the James Bond series is known for its protagonist's resourcefulness and ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations. The fact that Bond has already managed to cause a distraction and attempt an escape in the passage suggests that he will continue to try and find a way out of his predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and threatened by Blofeld and his henchman. The use of a sudden distraction (the bird crashing into the glass wall) and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The fact that Bond is now tied up and at the mercy of his captors adds to the sense of danger and suspense, leaving the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape this time.
