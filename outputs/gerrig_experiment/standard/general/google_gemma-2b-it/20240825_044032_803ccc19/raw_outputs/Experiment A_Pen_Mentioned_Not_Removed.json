"The passage is very suspenseful. The reader can feel the tension as Bond is being dragged into the room and as he is being searched by the two gunmen. The suspense is heightened by the fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned. The passage is also suspenseful because of the mystery surrounding Le Chiffre and his motives."
