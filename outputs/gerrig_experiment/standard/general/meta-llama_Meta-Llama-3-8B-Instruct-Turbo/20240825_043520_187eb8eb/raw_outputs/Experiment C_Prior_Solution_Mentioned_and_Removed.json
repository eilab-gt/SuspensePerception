"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is heavily restrained and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak. The wire wrapped around the chair and Bond's arms is causing him pain, and Crushak has been explicitly instructed to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him. This makes it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of external intervention.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors, and that any attempt to escape will likely result in harm or death. The description of the wire cutting into Bond's flesh and Crushak's menacing presence adds to the sense of danger and foreboding."
