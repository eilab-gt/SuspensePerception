"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nIt seems that Bond is currently trapped in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms, and he is being guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak. Additionally, Blofeld has announced his intention to leave Bond in the chair with Crushak, implying that Bond's chances of escape are slim.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being threatened by Blofeld and Crushak, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger."
