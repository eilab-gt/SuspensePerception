Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and outgunned, and he is currently trapped and disarmed.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a high-stakes situation where Bond is trapped and helpless, with no clear way out. The sudden and unexpected attack by Le Chiffre and his men creates a sense of tension and danger, and Bond's attempts to defend himself are thwarted. The passage also creates a sense of unease and vulnerability, as Bond is forced to confront his own impotence and helplessness.
