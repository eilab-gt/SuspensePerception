Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and Bond is being held in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and the chair's corners. This situation does not seem favorable for Bond's escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond and Vesper. The sudden crash of the bird into the wall, the distraction it causes, and the subsequent events that unfold create a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape from Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of vivid descriptions and the ominous tone of Blofeld's words add to the suspenseful atmosphere.
