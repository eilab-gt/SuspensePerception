Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point, as he is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have disarmed him by taking away his revolver and fountain pen.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and being held captive by Le Chiffre and his associates, and that Bond's attempts to escape or resist are being thwarted. The use of vivid language and descriptive details, such as the "spidery summons" and the "whistle of pain", adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
