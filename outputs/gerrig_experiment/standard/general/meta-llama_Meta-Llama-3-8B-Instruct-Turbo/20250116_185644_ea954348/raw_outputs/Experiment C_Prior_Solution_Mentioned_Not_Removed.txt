Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, with a large and ugly man, Crushak, holding him captive, and Blofeld has just warned him that Crushak is dedicated to eliminating any irritations from his life. Given these circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape anytime soon.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation where Bond is trapped and helpless against his captors. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" man, and the painful image of the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, creates a sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he'll meet a dire fate. The passage expertly builds tension and creates a sense of urgency, making it extremely suspenseful.
