Here are the answers:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Additionally, Bond's attempts to escape have been thwarted so far, with Crushak pinning him down with piano wire. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.
