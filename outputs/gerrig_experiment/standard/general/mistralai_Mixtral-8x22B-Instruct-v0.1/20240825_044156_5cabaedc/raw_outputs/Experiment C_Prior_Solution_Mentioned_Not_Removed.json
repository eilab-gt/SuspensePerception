" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n\nBased on the passage, it seems that Bond's chances of escaping from Blofeld are currently low. He has been captured and securely tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, it is not impossible for him to find a way out of this situation. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as 4. Neutral or Uncertain.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful. The sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the glass, Bond's attempt to escape, and his subsequent capture by Crushak all contribute to a tense and suspenseful atmosphere. Blofeld's threat to eliminate Bond and the description of Crushak's intimidating appearance further add to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as 6. Very suspenseful."
