Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, the situation seems dire with Blofeld's new guard, Crushak, who appears to be a formidable opponent.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is quite suspenseful as it describes Bond's attempt to escape, the distraction caused by the bird, and the subsequent capture by Blofeld and Crushak.
