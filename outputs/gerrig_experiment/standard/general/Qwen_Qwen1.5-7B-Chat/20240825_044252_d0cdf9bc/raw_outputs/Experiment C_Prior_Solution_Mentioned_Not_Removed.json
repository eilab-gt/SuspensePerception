"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nBased on the description provided, Bond has been caught off guard and his escape attempts have been thwarted twice. First, he is distracted by a bird, and then he is confronted by the large and ugly man, Crushak, who has tied him up with piano wire. Blofeld's confidence in Crushak's ability to eliminate Bond suggests that he is not expecting an easy escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is highly suspenseful as it presents a series of tense moments for Bond. The crash of the bird, Blofeld's stumble, and the sudden appearance of Crushak all create a sense of danger and urgency. Bond's desperate attempt to escape and the threat of being captured again heighten the suspense, as well as the revelation that his previous escape method didn't work and that Blofeld is more determined this time."
