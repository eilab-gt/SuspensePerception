***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond has been captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, Bond has a history of escaping from difficult situations, as mentioned in the passage. Additionally, Bond has already shown some resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall. However, the situation seems precarious, and Bond is currently at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because Bond is in a dangerous and precarious situation. He has been captured and tied up, and Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, seems menacing and capable of carrying out Blofeld's orders to eliminate Bond. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the contorted face of Crushak, adds to the tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from this situation, which creates a sense of suspense and anticipation.
