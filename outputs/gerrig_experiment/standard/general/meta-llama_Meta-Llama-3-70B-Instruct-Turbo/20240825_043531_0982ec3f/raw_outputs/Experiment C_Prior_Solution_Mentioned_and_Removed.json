"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would answer: 5. Moderately likely\n\nAlthough Bond has been caught and tied up, he has already shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird to try and escape. Additionally, Bond has a history of escaping from captivity, as mentioned in the passage. However, the presence of the formidable Crushak and the strict orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak suggest that escape will not be easy.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would answer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The threat of death is very real, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape. The use of descriptive language, such as the painful twisting of the piano wire into Bond's flesh, adds to the tension and suspense. The passage also raises questions about what will happen next, such as what Blofeld has planned for Bond and whether Bond will be able to outwit Crushak."
