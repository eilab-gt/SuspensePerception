"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation looks dire, but Bond's history of escaping from tight spots suggests that he might still find a way out.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond facing off against Blofeld and his henchman. The sudden introduction of the bird crashing into the glass wall adds an element of surprise, and the subsequent struggle and Bond's eventual capture creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The description of Crushak's ugly appearance and the painful binding of Bond's arms with piano wire adds to the sense of menace and suspense."
