"Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\nI would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past and has already attempted to escape once in this passage, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation looks dire, but Bond's past escapades suggest that he might still find a way to escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nI would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, from the sudden crash of the bird into the glass wall to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's ugly face and the painful binding of Bond with piano wire adds to the sense of danger and foreboding. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this precarious situation."
