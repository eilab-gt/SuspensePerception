"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?\"***\nAnswer: 2. Somewhat likely\n\nAlthough Bond has been caught off guard and is currently trapped, he has already shown his resourcefulness and agility in the passage. He was able to react quickly to the initial attack and minimize the damage. This suggests that he may still have a chance to escape, but it will likely require some clever thinking and quick action.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\nAnswer: 6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is very suspenseful because it sets up a dramatic and intense scene where Bond is suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of action verbs like \"burst\", \"leapt\", \"caught\", and \"twisted\" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is trapped and disarmed adds to the tension, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The passage effectively builds suspense and keeps the reader on edge."
