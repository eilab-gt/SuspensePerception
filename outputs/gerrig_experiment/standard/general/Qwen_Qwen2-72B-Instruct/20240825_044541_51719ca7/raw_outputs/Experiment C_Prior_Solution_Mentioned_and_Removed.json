"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n4. Neutral or Uncertain\n\nThe passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. However, given the previous history between Bond and Blofeld, and Bond's resourcefulness, it is not impossible that Bond might find a way to escape. The situation is complicated by the presence of Crushak, who is described as being devoted to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life and has orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with suspense as Bond is in a precarious situation, having just narrowly avoided being shot by Blofeld and now being tied up by Crushak. The description of the wire biting into Bond's flesh and the threat of being shot if he attempts to speak adds to the tension. The fact that Bond has previously outwitted Blofeld's guards also adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape again."
