"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nGiven the context, Bond is in a precarious situation, having been captured and secured with piano wire by a formidable guard. The previous attempt to escape ended in a failed distraction and immediate re-capture. The odds of a successful escape at this moment seem low.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is filled with tension and action, from the bird crashing into the window to Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture. The threat of violence and Bond's clever but foiled attempt to free himself create a sense of urgency and danger, making it quite suspenseful."
