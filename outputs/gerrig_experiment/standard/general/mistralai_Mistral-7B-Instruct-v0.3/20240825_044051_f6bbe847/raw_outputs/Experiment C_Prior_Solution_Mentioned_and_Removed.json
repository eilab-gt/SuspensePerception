" ***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n5. Moderately likely\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. Bond attempts to escape but is caught and bound. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond suggests that Bond may have outwitted Blofeld's guards in the past, which adds to the suspense as to whether he will be able to do so again. The use of a large bird crashing into the window and creating a distraction, as well as the mention of Blofeld's past guard dying in an automobile accident, further increases the suspense and suggests that Bond may have a chance to escape."
