Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to bring about the gambling losses for Blofeld, Blofeld has also laid a successful trap for him and has Bond and Vesper as his prisoners. It is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's custody without some form of assistance or a clever plan.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen, the passage does not provide any concrete details or clues that would make it extremely suspenseful. The passage does create a sense of tension and anticipation, however, as Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation and it is unclear how they will escape.
