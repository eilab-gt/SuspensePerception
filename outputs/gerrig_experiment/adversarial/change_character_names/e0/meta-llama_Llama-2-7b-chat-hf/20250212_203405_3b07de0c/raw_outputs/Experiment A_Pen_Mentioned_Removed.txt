  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond is resourceful and has managed to evade the gunmen so far, Le Chiffre appears to be a formidable opponent who has laid a successful trap for Bond. It is unclear at this point in the passage whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be captured.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is being pursued by the gunmen and is trying to evade them. The use of vivid language and the sense of urgency create a sense of suspense that keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
