  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to bring about the gambling losses for Blofeld, Blofeld has also laid a successful trap for him and has him and Vesper as his prisoners. It is unclear at this point in the passage how Bond will manage to escape from this predicament.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, as Bond is trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen, and the outcome is far from certain. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of tension create a sense of anticipation and suspense, making it difficult to predict what will happen next.
