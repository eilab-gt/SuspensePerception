I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the initial description. The passage appears to be from a different story, featuring a character named Morgan, not James Bond. Therefore, I cannot answer the questions based on the provided passage.

If you could provide the correct passage from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', I would be happy to assist you in answering the questions.
