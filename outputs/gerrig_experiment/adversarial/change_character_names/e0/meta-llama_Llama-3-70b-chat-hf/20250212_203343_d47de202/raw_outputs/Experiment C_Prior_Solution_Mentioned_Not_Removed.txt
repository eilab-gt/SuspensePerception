I think there's been a mistake! The passage provided doesn't seem to match the description of an excerpt from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. The passage appears to be a different story altogether, with characters named Alex and a scene involving a bird crashing into a window, a fight, and a character being tied up with piano wire.

If I were to answer the questions based on this passage, I would say:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from the situation?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Alex's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage has a sense of tension and danger, with a fight, a bird crashing into a window, and a character being tied up and threatened. The situation is intense and unpredictable, making it suspenseful.
