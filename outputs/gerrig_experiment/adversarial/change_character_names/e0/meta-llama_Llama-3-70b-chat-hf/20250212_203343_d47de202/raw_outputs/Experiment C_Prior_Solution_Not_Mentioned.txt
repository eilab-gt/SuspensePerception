I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the description. The passage appears to be from a different story, featuring characters named Morgan and Jordan, rather than James Bond and Blofeld.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the passage provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Morgan?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Jordan's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Jordan being tied up and threatened by Morgan and his associate. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
