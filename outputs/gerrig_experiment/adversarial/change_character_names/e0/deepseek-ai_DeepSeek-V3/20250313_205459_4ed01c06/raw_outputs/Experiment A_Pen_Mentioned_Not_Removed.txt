***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***  
**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful  

**Explanation:**  
- **Question 1:** Bond is in a precarious situation, but his resourcefulness and quick thinking (e.g., moving his fountain pen deeper into his pocket) suggest he has a plan. While the odds are against him, his skills and determination make escape moderately likely.  
- **Question 2:** The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes confrontation, Bond's sudden action, and the tension as he is searched and disarmed. The uncertainty of what will happen next keeps the reader on edge.
