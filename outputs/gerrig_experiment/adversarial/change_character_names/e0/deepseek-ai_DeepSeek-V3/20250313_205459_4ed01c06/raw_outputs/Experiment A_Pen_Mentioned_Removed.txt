**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful  

**Explanation:**  
1. Bond’s escape seems moderately likely because he is resourceful and has already attempted a bold move, but he is heavily outnumbered and disarmed, which reduces his chances.  
2. The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes situation, Bond’s quick thinking, and the tension created by the gunmen and Taylor’s actions.
