Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. The excerpt emphasizes his feeling of being "puny and impotent," suggesting the odds are stacked against him. However, it's a James Bond story, so a complete escape seems unlikely to be ruled out entirely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds suspense through several elements:

* **Sudden Attack:** The abrupt entrance of the gunmen creates immediate tension.
* **Bond's Skill vs. Overwhelming Odds:** We see Bond's fighting prowess, but he's quickly overpowered, raising the stakes.
* **Alex's Control:** Alex's calm demeanor and taunting actions heighten the sense of danger and uncertainty.
* **Bond's Powerlessness:** The description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" leaves the reader wondering how he will possibly overcome this situation.
