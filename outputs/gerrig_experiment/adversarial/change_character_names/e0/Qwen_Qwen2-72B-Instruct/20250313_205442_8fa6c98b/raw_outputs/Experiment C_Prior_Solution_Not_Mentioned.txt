Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?
Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage you provided is not from the original excerpt of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' but rather a different scenario involving characters named Morgan and Jordan. However, the suspense in this passage is high due to the immediate danger Jordan is in and the uncertainty of his fate. The unexpected events, such as the bird crashing into the window and the introduction of a new character with a gun, add to the tension. The fact that Jordan is tied up and left to contemplate his actions with a menacing figure present also increases the sense of suspense.
