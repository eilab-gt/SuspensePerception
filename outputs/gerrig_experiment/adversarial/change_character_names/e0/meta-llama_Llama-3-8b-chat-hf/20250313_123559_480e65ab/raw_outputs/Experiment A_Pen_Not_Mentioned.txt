Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that he is already a prisoner and has been disarmed. The situation appears to be dire, and Bond's chances of escape seem slim.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped, disarmed, and at the mercy of his captors. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors. The use of vivid language and the rapid pace of the action also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
