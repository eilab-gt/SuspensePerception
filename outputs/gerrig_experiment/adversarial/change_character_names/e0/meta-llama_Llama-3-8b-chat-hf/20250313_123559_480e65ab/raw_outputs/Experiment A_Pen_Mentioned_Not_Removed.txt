Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has just been disarmed and is being searched for any other weapons. Given his current circumstances, it's unlikely that he will be able to escape easily.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is being held captive by his enemies. The use of descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
