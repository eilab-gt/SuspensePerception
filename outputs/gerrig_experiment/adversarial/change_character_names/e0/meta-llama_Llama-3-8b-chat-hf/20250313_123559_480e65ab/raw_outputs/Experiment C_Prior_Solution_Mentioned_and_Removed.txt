Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which doesn't look promising for their escape chances.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation where the characters are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, and the painful wire wrapping around Riley's arms, adds to the suspense. The threat of being shot if they try to speak to Morgan also raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency.
