Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has just been disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes Bond's failed attempt to escape and his subsequent capture. The use of vivid language, such as "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins and brought a whistle of pain from him", creates a sense of tension and action. The fact that Bond is now a prisoner and at the mercy of his captors adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
