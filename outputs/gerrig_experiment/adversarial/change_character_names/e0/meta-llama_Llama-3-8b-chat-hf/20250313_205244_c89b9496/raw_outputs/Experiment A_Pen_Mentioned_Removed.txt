Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is being overpowered by his captors. The use of vivid language, such as "Like lightning" and "very quickly, but somehow delicately", adds to the sense of urgency and intensity. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
