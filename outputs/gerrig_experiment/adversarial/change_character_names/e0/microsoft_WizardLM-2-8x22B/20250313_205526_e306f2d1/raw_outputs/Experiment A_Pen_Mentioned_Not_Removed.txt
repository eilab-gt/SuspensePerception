1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's training, resourcefulness, and the fact that he has already attempted an escape, it seems moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The narrative suggests that Bond is not easily subdued and is always looking for opportunities to turn the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense situation where Bond is captured but still actively trying to resist and plan his next move. The physical confrontation and Bond's quick thinking to secure his pen, which could be a tool for escape or self-defense, add to the suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will succeed in escaping.
