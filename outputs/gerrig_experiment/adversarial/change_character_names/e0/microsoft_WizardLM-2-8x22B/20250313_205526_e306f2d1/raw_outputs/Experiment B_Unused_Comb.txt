1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he was able to defend himself, albeit briefly, against the gunmen suggests that he retains some level of control and the potential to exploit any mistakes made by his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a sudden and violent turn of events. Bond, who was previously confident and in control, is now outnumbered and captured. The detailed description of the confrontation, the search for weapons, and the taunting by Alex all contribute to a tense atmosphere that leaves the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this seemingly hopeless situation.
