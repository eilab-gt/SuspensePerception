 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it is not possible to determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld, as the excerpt does not contain any details about Bond's current situation or his plans for escaping.

Answer Question 2: The passage could be considered moderately suspenseful. The fact that Bond and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, as the reader does not know what will happen to them. However, without more information about the characters' plans or actions, the suspense is not as intense as it could be.
