 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured and overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. However, Bond does show some resourcefulness and determination in trying to escape. Given the limited context, it's difficult to definitively say how likely his escape is, but I would lean towards "somewhat likely" (2) as he has shown a capacity for quick thinking and physical prowess.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond being captured and at the mercy of Le Chiffre's men. There's a sense of uncertainty and danger, which can be suspenseful. However, without knowing the immediate consequences of this situation or the resolution, it's hard to rate the suspense level. Therefore, I would choose "somewhat suspenseful" (2).
