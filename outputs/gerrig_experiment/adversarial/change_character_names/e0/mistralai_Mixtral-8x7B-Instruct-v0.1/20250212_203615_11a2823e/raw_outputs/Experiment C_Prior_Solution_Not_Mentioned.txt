 **Question 1:** "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain.

The passage does not provide enough information about Bond's current situation or his abilities to determine the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2:** "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful.

While the passage does build some tension through the use of a dangerous situation and the presence of armed guards, it does not yet reach a level of extreme suspense as the outcome of the situation is not revealed.
