Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, the passage doesn't give us enough information to say he has no chance of escape.  Fleming often sets up seemingly hopeless situations for Bond, only for him to use his cunning and resources to turn the tables.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger. We see Alex captured and bound, and the threat of violence from Blofeld's associate is palpable. However, it lacks the immediate, heart-pounding action that would make it extremely suspenseful.
