Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 1. Not very likely** 

The passage states that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen.  Blofeld specifically mentions that Alex has orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak. This sets a very dangerous and restrictive situation for Bond, making escape seem unlikely.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds suspense effectively:

* **The setup:** We know Bond is in a dangerous situation, captured by a cunning adversary.
* **The distraction:** The bird crashing through the window creates a momentary opportunity for Morgan (presumably Bond) to act.
* **The counter-move:** Riley's quick thinking and the introduction of Alex, the brutal enforcer, immediately raise the stakes.
* **The threat:** Alex's orders to shoot Bond on any provocation create a palpable sense of danger and impending violence.
