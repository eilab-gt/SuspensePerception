***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
5. Moderately suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond (referred to as Jordan in this passage) is tied up with piano wire and under the control of Blofeld (Morgan) and his henchmen. The situation seems dire, and there is no immediate indication of an escape plan, making it "Not very likely" that Bond will escape at this moment.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is moderately suspenseful due to the tension created by Bond's capture, the use of piano wire, and the threat posed by Blofeld and his henchmen. However, the suspense is not at its peak, as there is no immediate life-or-death confrontation or clear escalation of danger.
