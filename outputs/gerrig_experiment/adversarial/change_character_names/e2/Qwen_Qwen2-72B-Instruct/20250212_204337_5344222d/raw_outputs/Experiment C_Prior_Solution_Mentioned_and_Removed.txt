Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage you provided is not from the excerpt of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' but rather a different scenario involving characters named Alex and Morgan. However, the level of suspense in this passage is high due to the immediate danger Morgan is in and the uncertainty of his fate. The tension is further heightened by the introduction of a new antagonist, Riley, and the description of the painful method used to restrain Morgan.
