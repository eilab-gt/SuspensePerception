Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and outmatched, the excerpt highlights his resourcefulness and fighting skills.  He's shown to be quick-thinking and capable of evading immediate danger.  It's too early to say he's definitely doomed.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen searching him and Morgan's menacing actions create a sense of danger and uncertainty. We're left wondering how Bond will escape this predicament.
