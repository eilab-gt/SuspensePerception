Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 1. Not very likely** 

The passage states that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen.  Blofeld is described as having laid a successful trap, and the excerpt emphasizes the danger Bond is in.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger.  We see Morgan captured and bound, threatened with violence. The description of Riley's menacing appearance and the threat of being shot adds to the suspense.
