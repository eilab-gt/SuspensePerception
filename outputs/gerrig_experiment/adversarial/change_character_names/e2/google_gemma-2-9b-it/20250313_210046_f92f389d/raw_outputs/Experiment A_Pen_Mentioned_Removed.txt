Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and disarmed, the excerpt shows his quick thinking, agility, and resourcefulness. He managed to briefly fight back and conceal a weapon.  Fleming's writing often portrays Bond as resourceful and capable of overcoming seemingly impossible odds.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of dangerous adversaries. The descriptions of the fight, the close calls, and the threat of violence create a sense of urgency and anticipation.  We are left wondering what will happen next and if Bond can escape.
