Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation,  he's resourceful and skilled.  The passage doesn't give us enough information to say he's definitely doomed. There's always a chance he'll find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond captured, threatened, and tied up. The description of the wire cutting into his flesh adds a physical element of danger. However, it's not yet at a point of extreme, heart-pounding suspense.
