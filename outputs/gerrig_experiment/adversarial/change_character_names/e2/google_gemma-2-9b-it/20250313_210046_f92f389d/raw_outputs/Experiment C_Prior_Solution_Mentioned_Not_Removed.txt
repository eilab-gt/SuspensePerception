Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, the passage doesn't give us enough information to say he has no chance.  Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape seemingly impossible situations.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension with the description of Alex's capture and the threat posed by the large, ugly man. The mention of a previous escape attempt and the implication of a violent end adds to the suspense.
