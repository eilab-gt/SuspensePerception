 Answer Question 1: 2. Somewhat likely
Bond has been a successful agent for the British government and has likely found himself in similar situations before. However, Blofeld is a dangerous and cunning opponent, so it is not guaranteed that Bond will escape.

Answer Question 2: 5. Moderately suspenseful
The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Blofeld, but it does not provide much detail about what will happen next. This leaves room for the reader to imagine various outcomes and creates a sense of suspense.
