 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen after his escape attempt was unsuccessful. Considering this, I would answer "1. Not very likely" to the question of how likely it is that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense scene in which Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but is ultimately caught and disarmed. The use of descriptive language and the sense of urgency in the scene make it feel suspenseful. Therefore, I would answer "6. Very suspenseful" to the question of how suspenseful I find this passage to be.
