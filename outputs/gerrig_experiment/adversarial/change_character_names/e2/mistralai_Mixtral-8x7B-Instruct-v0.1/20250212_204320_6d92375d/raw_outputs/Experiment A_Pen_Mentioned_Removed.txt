 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently captured and outnumbered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond does show some resourcefulness and resistance, but it's still unclear if he can escape. I would rate it as "Somewhat likely" (2) that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, considering there are many unknown factors not presented in this passage.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen after being captured. There's a sense of uncertainty and danger, making the passage "Moderately suspenseful" (5).
