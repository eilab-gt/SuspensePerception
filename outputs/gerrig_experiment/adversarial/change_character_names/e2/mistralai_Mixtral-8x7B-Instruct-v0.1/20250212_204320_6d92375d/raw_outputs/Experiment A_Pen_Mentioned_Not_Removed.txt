 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being held prisoner by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond does attempt to escape and shows some resourcefulness in doing so, even though his attempt is unsuccessful this time. Considering his determination and past experiences, there is a possibility that he might try to escape again and possibly succeed. So, I would rate it as "moderately likely" that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but his efforts are thwarted. This creates a sense of suspense as the reader is unsure of what will happen next. Additionally, the fact that Bond is a well-known and beloved character adds to the suspense, as readers will be eager to know if he can escape this situation. Therefore, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful".
