 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we do not have the context of what happens next or Bond's resourcefulness in similar situations. However, considering Bond's reputation as a skilled and tenacious secret agent, one might assume that there is a possibility, though not a high probability, that he could escape. So, I would choose "3. Slightly likely".

Question 2: The passage describes a dangerous situation for Bond, and the immediate threat of violence from Blofeld and his men creates a sense of suspense. However, without knowing the outcome or what happens next, it's difficult to judge the level of suspense. Therefore, I would choose "4. Neutral or Uncertain".
