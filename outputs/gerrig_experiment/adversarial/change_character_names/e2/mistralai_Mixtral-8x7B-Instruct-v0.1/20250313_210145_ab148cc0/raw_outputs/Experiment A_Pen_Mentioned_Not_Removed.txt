 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being held prisoner by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond does attempt to escape and shows some resourcefulness in doing so, even though his attempt is unsuccessful this time. Considering his determination and past experiences, there is a possibility that he might escape in the future. So, I would rate it as "moderately likely" that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful atmosphere. Bond is in a dangerous situation, and the narrative details his failed escape attempt, which adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next to Bond and Vesper, and whether Bond will be able to escape or not. Therefore, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful".
