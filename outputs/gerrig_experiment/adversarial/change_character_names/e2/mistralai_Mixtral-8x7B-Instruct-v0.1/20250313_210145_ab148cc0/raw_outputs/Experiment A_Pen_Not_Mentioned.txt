 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured and overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. However, Bond does show some resourcefulness and determination in trying to escape. Given the limited context, it's difficult to definitively say how likely his escape is, but I would lean towards "somewhat likely" (2) as he has shown a capacity for quick thinking and physical prowess.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond being captured and attempting to escape. The description of the Corsican quickly reacting to Bond's kick and the ensuing struggle adds a sense of urgency. However, the tension is somewhat alleviated by the fact that Bond is quickly overpowered. Therefore, I would rate the suspense as "moderately suspenseful" (5).
