Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. The fact that Le Chiffre is actively taking away his tools (revolver, pen) suggests a difficult escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and disarmed. The descriptions of the Corsican's quick movements and Jordan's watchful eye create a sense of imminent threat.  The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament.
