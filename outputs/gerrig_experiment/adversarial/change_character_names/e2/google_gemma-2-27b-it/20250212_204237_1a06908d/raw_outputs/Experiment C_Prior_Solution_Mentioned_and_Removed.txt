Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**4. Neutral or Uncertain**

The passage states Bond is a prisoner, but it doesn't give any clues about his chances of escape. We know he's resourceful, but Blofeld is clearly dangerous and prepared. 

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through:

* **Bond's capture:**  He's in a dangerous situation with a powerful enemy.
* **Vesper's involvement:** Her safety is also at risk, adding emotional weight.
* **Blofeld's cunning:** He's clearly planned this trap, making him a formidable opponent.

However, we don't have enough information about Bond's immediate plans or Blofeld's intentions to make it *very* suspenseful.
