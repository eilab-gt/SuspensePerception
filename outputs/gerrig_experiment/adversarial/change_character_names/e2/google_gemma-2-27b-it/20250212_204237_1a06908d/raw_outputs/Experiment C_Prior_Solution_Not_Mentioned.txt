Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

The passage states Bond is a prisoner, but we don't have enough information about Blofeld's security, Bond's resources, or any potential plans he might have.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through:

* **Bond's capture:** He's in a dangerous situation with limited options.
* **Blofeld's cunning:** He's clearly intelligent and has anticipated Bond's moves.
* **The unknown:** We don't know what Blofeld's ultimate plan is or how Bond will react.
