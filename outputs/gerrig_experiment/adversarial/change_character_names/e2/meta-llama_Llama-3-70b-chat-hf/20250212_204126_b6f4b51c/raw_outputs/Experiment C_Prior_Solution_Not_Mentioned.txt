I think there's been a mistake! The passage provided doesn't seem to match the description of an excerpt from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. The passage appears to be a different story altogether, with characters named Jordan and Morgan.

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the passage provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Morgan and Jordan?"***
I'll choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Jordan's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I'll choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Jordan being tied up and threatened by Morgan and Jordan. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the "painfully" twisting piano wire, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
