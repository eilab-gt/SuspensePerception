I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the initial description. The passage appears to be from a different story, featuring characters named Alex, Morgan, and Riley, rather than James Bond, Blofeld, and Vesper.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Morgan will escape from Alex and Riley?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Morgan, but it's unclear what opportunities he might have to escape or what skills he possesses to aid in his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Morgan being captured and tied up, and the threat of violence from Riley. The situation is precarious, and the reader is left wondering how Morgan will manage to escape or what will happen to him next.
