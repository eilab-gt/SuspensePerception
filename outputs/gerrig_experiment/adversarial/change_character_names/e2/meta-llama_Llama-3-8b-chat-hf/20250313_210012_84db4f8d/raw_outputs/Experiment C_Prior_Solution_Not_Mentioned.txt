Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that their situation is quite dire and escape seems unlikely at this point.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger from the start. The sudden crash of the bird into the wall, the distraction, and the unexpected twist of events keep the reader on edge, wondering what will happen next. The description of the large and ugly man, the use of darkness and shadows, and the painful binding of Jordan's arms all contribute to a sense of foreboding and suspense.
