Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from this situation without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being disarmed, and it seems like he is at the mercy of his captors. The use of descriptive language, such as "like lightning" and "very quickly, but somehow delicately", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
