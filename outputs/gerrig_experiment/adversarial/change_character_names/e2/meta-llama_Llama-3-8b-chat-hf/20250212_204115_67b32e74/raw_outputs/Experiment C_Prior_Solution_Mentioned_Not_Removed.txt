Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which doesn't look promising for their escape chances.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, and the painful wire wrapping around Alex's arms, creates a sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond and Vesper will be able to escape or not.
