Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that he is already a prisoner and has been disarmed. The situation appears to be quite dire for Bond.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and being handled by his captors, and there is a sense of tension and uncertainty about what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions and quick action adds to the suspense, making it difficult to put the story down.
