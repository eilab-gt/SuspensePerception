Answering the questions based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and Blofeld has taken measures to ensure their capture, including assigning a guard to shoot Bond if he tries to escape. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Alex (who is likely Bond) is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The description of the physical restraints and the threat of violence creates a sense of unease, making the passage very suspenseful.
