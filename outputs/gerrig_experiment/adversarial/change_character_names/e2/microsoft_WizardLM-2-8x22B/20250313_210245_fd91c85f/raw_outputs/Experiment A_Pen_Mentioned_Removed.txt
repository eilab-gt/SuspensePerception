1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's training and resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a concealed weapon (the fountain pen) suggests that he has a plan and the means to execute it. However, the situation is still dangerous and the outcome uncertain, which is why the likelihood is not higher.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a tense and dynamic situation where Bond is a prisoner but actively trying to resist and plan an escape. The physical confrontation, the quick thinking, and the presence of armed adversaries all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will manage to turn the situation to his advantage, which is a hallmark of suspenseful storytelling
