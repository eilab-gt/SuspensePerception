1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being outnumbered and unarmed, Bond's skills and experience suggest that he has a reasonable chance of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events where Bond, who was previously confident and in control, finds himself captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The detailed description of the confrontation and Bond's quick thinking in the face of danger contribute to a tense and engaging scene that leaves the reader eager to find out how Bond will extricate himself from this perilous situation.
