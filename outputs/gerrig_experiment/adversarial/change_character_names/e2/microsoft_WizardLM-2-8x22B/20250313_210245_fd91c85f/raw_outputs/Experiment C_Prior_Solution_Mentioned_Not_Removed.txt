1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
   - Given the information provided, it's not explicitly stated how Bond might escape or what resources he has at his disposal. However, considering Bond's reputation and history of escaping from perilous situations, it would be reasonable to assume that there is a chance he could escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as:
     3. Slightly likely

2. **How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
   - The passage provided does not directly describe a scene involving Bond and Blofeld but instead presents a similar scenario with a character named Alex. The suspense in the passage is moderate, as there is a sense of danger and uncertainty due to the captivity and the introduction of a new threat. However, without the context of Bond's own situation, the suspense is somewhat diluted.
