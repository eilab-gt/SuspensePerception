1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's reputation for resourcefulness and previous escapes from perilous situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has some knowledge of his surroundings could work in his favor. Additionally, Bond's training and experience in dealing with captors suggest that he has a reasonable chance of escaping.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the presence of armed gunmen all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape or not.
