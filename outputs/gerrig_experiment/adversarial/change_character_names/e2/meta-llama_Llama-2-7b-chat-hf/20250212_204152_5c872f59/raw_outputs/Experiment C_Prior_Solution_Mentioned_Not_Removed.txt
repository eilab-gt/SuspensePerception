Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to bring about the gambling losses that trapped him and Vesper, Blofeld has also laid a successful trap for him. Blofeld is a cunning and resourceful villain, and it will not be easy for Bond to escape from his clutches.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency in the passage, the outcome is not entirely clear. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap and whether Vesper will be able to help him. The passage does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of uncertainty, which keeps the reader engaged.
