Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. The excerpt emphasizes his feeling of being "puny and impotent," suggesting the odds are stacked against him. However, it's a James Bond story, so a complete escape seems unlikely to be ruled out entirely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a strong sense of suspense through several elements:

* **Sudden Attack:** The abrupt entrance of the gunmen and the violence of the encounter immediately grab the reader's attention.
* **Bond's Vulnerability:** Despite his skills, Bond is caught off guard and disarmed, making him appear vulnerable.
* **Alex's Control:** Alex's calm demeanor and taunting actions heighten the tension and create a sense of impending danger.
* **Bond's Helplessness:** The description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" leaves the reader wondering how he will possibly escape
