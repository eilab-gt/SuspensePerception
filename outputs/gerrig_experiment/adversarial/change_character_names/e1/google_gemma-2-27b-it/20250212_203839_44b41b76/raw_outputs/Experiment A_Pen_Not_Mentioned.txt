Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and fighting skills, he's outnumbered and outgunned. The situation is precarious, and escape seems difficult but not impossible given Bond's resourcefulness.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and facing a dangerous adversary. The descriptions of the fight and Jordan's cold demeanor create a sense of urgency and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
