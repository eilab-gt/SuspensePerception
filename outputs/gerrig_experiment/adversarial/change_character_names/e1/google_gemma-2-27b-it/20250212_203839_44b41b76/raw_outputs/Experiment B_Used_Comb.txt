Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. The excerpt ends with him feeling "puny and impotent," suggesting the odds are stacked against him.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, Bond's initial struggle, and his ultimate capture create a strong sense of tension and uncertainty. The ending leaves the reader wondering what will happen next and how Bond will get out of this predicament.
