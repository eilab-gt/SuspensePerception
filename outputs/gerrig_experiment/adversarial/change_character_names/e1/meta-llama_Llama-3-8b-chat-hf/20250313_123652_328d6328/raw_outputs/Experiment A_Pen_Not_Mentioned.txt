Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that he is already a prisoner and has been disarmed. The situation appears to be quite dire for Bond.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and being searched, and there is a sense of tension as the reader waits to see what will happen next. The use of vivid language and the description of the action also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
