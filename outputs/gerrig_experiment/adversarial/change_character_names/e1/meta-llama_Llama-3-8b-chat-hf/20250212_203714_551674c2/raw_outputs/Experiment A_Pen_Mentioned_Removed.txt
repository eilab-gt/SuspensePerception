Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being outnumbered and outgunned by Le Chiffre's henchmen. He has been caught off guard and is now being searched and disarmed. Given these circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a life-or-death situation, and the tension is palpable. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket", adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
