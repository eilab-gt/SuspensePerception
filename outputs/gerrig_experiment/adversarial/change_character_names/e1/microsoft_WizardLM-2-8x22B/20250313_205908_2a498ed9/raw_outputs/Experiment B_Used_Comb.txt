1. **Moderately likely (5)** - Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. His quick thinking and combat skills have already been demonstrated in the excerpt, suggesting that he has a fair chance of turning the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)** - The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and violent confrontation, with Bond being outnumbered and trapped. The detail of Morgan taking Bond's comb, an innocuous item, and using it to taunt Bond about his helplessness adds to the tension. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to overcome these odds and escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.
