I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the description. The passage appears to be from a different story, featuring characters named Alex, Morgan, and Riley, rather than James Bond, Blofeld, and Vesper.

If you could provide the correct passage from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', I would be happy to assist you in answering the questions.

However, if you'd like, I can still answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from Morgan?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Alex, but it's unclear what opportunities he might have to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Alex being captured and threatened by Morgan and Riley. The use of violence and the ominous tone contribute to the suspense.
