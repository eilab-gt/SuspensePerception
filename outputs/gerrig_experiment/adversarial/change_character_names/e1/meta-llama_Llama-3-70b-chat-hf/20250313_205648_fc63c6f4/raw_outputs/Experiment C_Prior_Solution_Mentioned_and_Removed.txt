I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the description. The passage appears to be from a different story, featuring characters named Morgan, Riley, and Alex, rather than James Bond, Blofeld, and Vesper.

If you could provide the correct passage from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', I would be happy to help answer the questions.

However, based on the passage provided, I can attempt to answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from Morgan?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain, as the passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Riley's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful, as the passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Riley being captured and threatened by Morgan and Alex.
