 Answer Question 1: 2. Somewhat likely
Bond has been a successful agent for the British government and has likely been in similar or more dangerous situations in the past. However, he is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, so it is not guaranteed that he will escape.

Answer Question 2: 5. Moderately suspenseful
The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld. The stakes are high, as Bond's mission is to ruin Blofeld and it is unclear how he will escape from this situation. However, the passage does not provide enough information to determine if it is extremely suspenseful or not.
