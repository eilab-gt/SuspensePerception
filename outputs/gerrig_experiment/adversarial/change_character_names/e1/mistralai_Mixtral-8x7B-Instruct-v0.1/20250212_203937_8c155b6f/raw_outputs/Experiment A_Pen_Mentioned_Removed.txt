 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently captured and outnumbered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond does show some resourcefulness and resistance, but it's unclear if he can overpower them. Hence, I would answer "2. Somewhat likely" for now, but this could change depending on the following narrative.

Question 2: Considering the fact that James Bond is a renowned secret agent, and based on the exciting and tense scene described in the passage, I would answer "6. Very suspenseful". The scene is filled with uncertainty and danger, which are key elements of suspense.
