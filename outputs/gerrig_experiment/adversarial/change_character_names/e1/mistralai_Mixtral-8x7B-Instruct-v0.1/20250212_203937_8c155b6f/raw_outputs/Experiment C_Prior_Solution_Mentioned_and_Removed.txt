 Answer Question 1: 2. Somewhat likely
Bond has a history of escaping from dangerous situations, but since the excerpt does not provide details about his current situation or resources, it's difficult to say for certain. However, based on his character and past experiences, it's reasonable to assume that he has a chance of escaping.

Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful
The excerpt sets up a tense and dangerous situation for Bond, and the reader is left wondering about his fate. The presence of armed guards, the use of piano wire to bind him, and the reference to a previous escape all contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
