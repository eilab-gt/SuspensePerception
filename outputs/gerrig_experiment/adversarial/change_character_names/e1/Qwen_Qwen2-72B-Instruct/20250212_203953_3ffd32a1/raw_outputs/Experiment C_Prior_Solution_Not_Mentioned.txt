Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage you provided is not from the original Ian Fleming excerpt but rather a different scenario. However, the suspense in this passage is high due to the immediate danger Jordan is in and the uncertainty of his fate. The unexpected events, such as the bird crashing into the window and the introduction of a new character with a gun, add to the tension. The method of tying up Jordan with piano wire also creates a sense of brutality and danger, contributing to the overall suspense.
