Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While the passage sets up a dangerous situation for Bond and Vesper, it doesn't give us enough information to determine how likely an escape is. We don't know the layout of Blofeld's lair, the capabilities of his gunmen, or Bond's current resources.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Morgan in a vulnerable position, facing a dangerous adversary. The descriptions of Jordan's actions and the physical threat of the piano wire create a sense of unease and anticipation.
