Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 1. Not very likely** 

The passage clearly states that Alex (presumably Bond) is captured and bound tightly.  He's facing a ruthless individual (Riley) with orders to kill him if he makes a sound.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The scene is tense and claustrophobic. Alex is trapped, outnumbered, and facing a deadly threat. The description of Riley's menacing presence and the tightening piano wire create a strong sense of impending danger.
