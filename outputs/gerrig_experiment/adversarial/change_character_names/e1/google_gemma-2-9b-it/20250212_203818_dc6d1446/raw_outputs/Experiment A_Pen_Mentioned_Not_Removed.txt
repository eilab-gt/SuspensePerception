Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and disarmed, the passage shows his quick thinking, agility, and resourcefulness. He managed to briefly disrupt the gunmen and conceal his pen, suggesting he's not easily defeated.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The scene is tense and action-packed. Bond is outnumbered and at a disadvantage, but his attempt to escape creates immediate tension. The description of the gunmen's actions and Alex's watchful eye heightens the sense of danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
