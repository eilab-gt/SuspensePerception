Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and outmatched, the excerpt highlights his resourcefulness and fighting skills.  He's shown to be quick-thinking and capable of surprising his opponents.  It's not impossible for him to find a way out, but the odds are stacked against him at this point.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen searching him and the way Alex toys with him creates a sense of vulnerability and impending danger.  We know Bond is in trouble, but we're left wondering how he will escape.
