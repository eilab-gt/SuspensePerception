Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, the passage doesn't give us enough information to say he has no chance of escape.  Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage sets up a clear conflict and danger for Alex. The descriptions of the capture and the threat from the large man create a sense of tension. However, it lacks the immediate, heart-pounding action that would make it extremely suspenseful.
