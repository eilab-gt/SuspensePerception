Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and disarmed, the excerpt shows his quick thinking, agility, and resourcefulness. He managed to briefly fight back and conceal a weapon.  This suggests he's not easily defeated and will likely try to find an opportunity to escape.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of dangerous adversaries. The descriptions of the fight, the threat of violence, and the uncertainty of Bond's fate create a sense of anticipation and worry for his well-being.
