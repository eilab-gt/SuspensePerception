Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, the passage doesn't give us enough information to say he has no chance of escape.  Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension through:

* **The initial setup:** Bond and Vesper are prisoners, trapped by Blofeld.
* **The mention of Blofeld's trap:** This suggests danger and a lack of control for Bond.
* **The focus on the characters' vulnerability:**  Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen.
