1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and the fact that he has previously managed to escape from difficult situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. His quick thinking and physical prowess, as demonstrated by his attempt to follow Vesper and his agile recovery after being tripped, suggest that he has a fair chance of turning the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is outnumbered and captured by the enemy. The detailed description of the physical confrontation, Bond's quick but unsuccessful attempt to hide his pen (which could be a potential tool for escape), and Le Chiffre's ominous words all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen next.
