1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness and combat skills demonstrated in the passage, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being outnumbered and unarmed, Bond has already managed to incapacitate one of the gunmen and has a history of getting out of tight situations.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events where Bond, after a moment of vulnerability, is confronted by his nemesis and his henchmen. The detailed description of the confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the uncertainty of his situation contribute to a high level of suspense.
