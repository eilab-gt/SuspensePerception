Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without a plan or some kind of help.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Blofeld is gloating over their predicament. The use of dark and dim lighting, the presence of guns, and the physical restraints on Bond all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he'll be caught.
