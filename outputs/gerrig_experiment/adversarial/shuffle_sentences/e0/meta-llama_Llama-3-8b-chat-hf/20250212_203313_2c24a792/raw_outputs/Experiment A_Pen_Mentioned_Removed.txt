Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from their captors at this point.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and being searched by their captors. The use of words like "lightning", "whistled", "whistle of pain", and "crashed to the ground" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like anything could happen at any moment. The fact that Bond is able to subtly move his fountain pen into his breast pocket adds to the suspense, as it suggests that he may still have a chance to escape or fight back.
