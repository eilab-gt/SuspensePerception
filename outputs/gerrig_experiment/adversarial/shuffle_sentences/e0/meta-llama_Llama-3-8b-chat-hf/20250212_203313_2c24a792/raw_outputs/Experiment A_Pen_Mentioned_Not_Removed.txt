Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being led away. Bond has just been disarmed and is being dragged to his feet. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his captors at this point.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond and Vesper are being taken away by their captors, and Bond is trying to find a way to escape. The use of action-packed language, such as "crashed to the ground", "rolled agilely", and "hurled himself down the passage", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape and rescue Vesper.
