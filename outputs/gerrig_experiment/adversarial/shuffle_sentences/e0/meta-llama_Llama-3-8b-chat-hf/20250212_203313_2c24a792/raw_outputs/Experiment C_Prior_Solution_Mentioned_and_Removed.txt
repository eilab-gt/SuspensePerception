Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is physically restrained and surrounded by two gunmen. The situation appears dire, and Bond's chances of escape seem slim.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the pain of the piano wire and the ugliness of Crushak's face, adds to the suspense. The sudden interruption by the bird crashing into the wall of glass also adds an element of surprise, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.
