Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and helpless against Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The fact that Bond is being tied up and pinned down by piano wire makes it unlikely that he will be able to escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, and that Blofeld is not going to go easy on him. The sudden interruption by the bird crashing into the wall adds to the suspense, and the revelation that Bond has managed to find a way to escape (albeit temporarily) creates a sense of excitement and anticipation. The overall atmosphere is dark and foreboding, making it extremely suspenseful.
