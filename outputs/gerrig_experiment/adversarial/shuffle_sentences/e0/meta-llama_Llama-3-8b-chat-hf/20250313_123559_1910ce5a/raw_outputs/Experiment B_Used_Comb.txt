Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently trapped and being searched by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's situation as dire, with him being trapped and helpless against the three men. The use of words like "puny" and "impotent" to describe Bond's feelings adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The sudden twist at the end, where Bond manages to take down one of the gunmen, adds a surprise element that keeps the reader engaged and curious about what will happen next.
