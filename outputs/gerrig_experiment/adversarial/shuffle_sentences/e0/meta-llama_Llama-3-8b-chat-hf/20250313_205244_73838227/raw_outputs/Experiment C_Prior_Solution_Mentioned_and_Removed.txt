Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and pinned down by Crushak, with no clear opportunity to escape. Blofeld's men are armed and seem to be in control, making it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or intervention.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger from the start. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The sudden interruption by the bird adds to the suspense, and the description of Bond's physical discomfort and the danger posed by Crushak and Blofeld's men creates a sense of urgency and fear. The passage expertly builds tension and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next.
