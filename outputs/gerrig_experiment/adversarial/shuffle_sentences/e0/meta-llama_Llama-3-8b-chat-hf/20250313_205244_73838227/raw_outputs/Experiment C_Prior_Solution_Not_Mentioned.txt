Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and pinned down by piano wire, with two gunmen and Blofeld himself surrounding him. The odds are against him, and it's unlikely that he will escape without some kind of help or clever plan.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation, with Bond trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of dark lighting, the sound of a gun going off, and the sudden appearance of a large bird crashing into the wall all contribute to a sense of high stakes and uncertainty. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next.
