Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's situation as precarious and uncertain. He is trapped, being searched, and is at the mercy of his captors. The tension is heightened by the fact that Bond is a skilled agent who is usually able to escape from difficult situations, but in this case, he seems to be at a disadvantage. The passage also creates a sense of unease and uncertainty, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next.
