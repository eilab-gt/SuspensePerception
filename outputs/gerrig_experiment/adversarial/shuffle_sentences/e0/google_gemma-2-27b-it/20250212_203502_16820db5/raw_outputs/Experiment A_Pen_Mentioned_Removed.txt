**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

* **Reasoning:** The passage is filled with tension. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and outgunned. The descriptions of Le Chiffre's actions and Bond's desperate attempts to gain an advantage create a sense of urgency and uncertainty about his fate.
