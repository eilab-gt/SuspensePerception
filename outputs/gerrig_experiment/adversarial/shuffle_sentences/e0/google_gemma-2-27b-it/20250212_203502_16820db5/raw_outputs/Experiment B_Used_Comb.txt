Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is resourceful and has shown fighting skills, he is currently outnumbered and outgunned. The excerpt doesn't give enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the following elements:

* **Bond's capture:** He is clearly in a dangerous situation.
* **Le Chiffre's control:** Le Chiffre is portrayed as cunning and in charge.
* **Bond's vulnerability:** The description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" adds to the tension.
* **Uncertain outcome:** The excerpt ends without revealing Bond's fate, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
