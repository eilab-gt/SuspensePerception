Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and facing a dangerous situation, he has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations. The excerpt hints at his resourcefulness (pulling up the rug) and Blofeld's past failures to contain him.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension-building elements:

* **Bond is captured and threatened:** The description of the wire cutting into his flesh and Blofeld's mention of eliminating irritations creates a sense of danger.
* **Unexpected events:** The bird crashing through the window and the sudden darkness add an element of surprise and unpredictability.
* **Blofeld's menacing demeanor:** His dialogue is cold and calculating, highlighting the threat Bond faces.
* **Bond's attempts to escape:** His subtle actions, like pulling up the rug, suggest he's looking for an opportunity, keeping the reader on edge.
