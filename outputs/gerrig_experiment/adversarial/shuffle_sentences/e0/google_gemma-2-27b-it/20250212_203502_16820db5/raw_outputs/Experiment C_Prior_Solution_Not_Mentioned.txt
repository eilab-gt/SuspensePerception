Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and in a precarious situation, he has a history of cunning escapes and resourcefulness. The excerpt shows him already attempting to take advantage of distractions and find ways to free himself.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere with Bond being captured, threatened, and physically restrained. The sudden appearance of the bird, the darkness, and Blofeld's menacing demeanor all contribute to a feeling of uncertainty and impending danger.
