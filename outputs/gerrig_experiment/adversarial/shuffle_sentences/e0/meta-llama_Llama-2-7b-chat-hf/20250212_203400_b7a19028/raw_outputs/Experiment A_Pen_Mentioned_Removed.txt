  Great, thank you for providing the passage from Casino Royale! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as Moderately likely. While Bond is able to evade Le Chiffre's gunmen and make a break for it, Le Chiffre's superior numbers and weaponry make it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape unscathed.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The use of quick, precise movements and the sudden twist of Le Chiffre's hand to catch Bond's shoe and twist it sharply create a sense of tension and danger. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen adds to the suspense, as it is unclear what will happen to Bond next.
