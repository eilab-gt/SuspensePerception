Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely." While Bond has managed to outwit Blofeld in the past, he is currently in a difficult situation and is being held captive by Blofeld's two gunmen. However, Bond is a resourceful and skilled secret agent, and he may be able to find a way to escape or outsmart his captors.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful." While there is a sense of danger and urgency in the passage, as Bond is being held captive by Blofeld's gunmen, the suspense is not as high as it could be. The passage does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of unease, but it could benefit from more intense and dramatic moments to really ramp up the suspense.
