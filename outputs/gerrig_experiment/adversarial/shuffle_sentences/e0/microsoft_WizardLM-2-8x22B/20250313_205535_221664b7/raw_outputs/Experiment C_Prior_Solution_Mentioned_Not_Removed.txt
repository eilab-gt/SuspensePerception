1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a skilled and resourceful agent, it is reasonable to assume that there is a moderate likelihood that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches. The passage suggests that Bond has escaped from Blofeld before, and the fact that Blofeld is taking extra precautions this time indicates that he considers Bond a significant threat.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and bound by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The mention of a previous escape, the introduction of a new threat (Crushak), and the physical restraints placed on Bond all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate, which is typical of suspenseful narratives. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle this precarious situation.
