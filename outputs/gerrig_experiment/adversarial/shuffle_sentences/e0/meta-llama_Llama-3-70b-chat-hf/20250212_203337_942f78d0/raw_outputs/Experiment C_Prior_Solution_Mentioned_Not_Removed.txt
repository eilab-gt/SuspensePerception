***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. Although the passage describes Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape, given his character's reputation and the genre of the novel.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the description of Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of phrases such as "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" and "a large bird crashed into the wall of glass" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader wonder how Bond will escape from this situation. The passage also sets up a sense of cat-and-mouse between Bond and Blofeld, which adds to the suspense.
