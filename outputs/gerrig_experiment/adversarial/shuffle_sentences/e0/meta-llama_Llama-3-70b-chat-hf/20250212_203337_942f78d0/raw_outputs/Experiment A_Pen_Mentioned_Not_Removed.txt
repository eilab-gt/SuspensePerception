***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 5: Moderately likely. Although Bond is currently a prisoner, the passage suggests that he is already planning to take action and cause damage to the gunmen, which implies that he has not given up hope of escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Bond being searched and disarmed, the Corsican's sudden and violent reaction to Bond's attempted attack, and Bond's desperate attempt to follow Vesper as she is led away. The sense of danger and urgency is palpable, making the passage very suspenseful.
