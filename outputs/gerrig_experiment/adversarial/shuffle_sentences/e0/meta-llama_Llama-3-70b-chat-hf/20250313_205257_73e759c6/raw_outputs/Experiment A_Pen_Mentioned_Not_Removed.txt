***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 5: Moderately likely. Although Bond is currently a prisoner and at a disadvantage, he is a skilled and resourceful agent, and the passage suggests that he is already thinking of ways to escape and cause damage to his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Bond's failed attempt to attack the Corsican, his being searched and disarmed, and the ominous tone of Le Chiffre's words and actions. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, and whether Bond will be able to escape from his precarious situation.
