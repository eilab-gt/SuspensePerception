***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it is likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the "painfully" tightening piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, which keeps the reader engaged and suspenseful.
