Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and disarmed, the excerpt shows his quick thinking, agility, and resourcefulness. He manages to kick one of the gunmen,  conceals his fountain pen, and is clearly planning his next move.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and disarmed.  The descriptions of the gunmen's actions ("Like lightning," "very quickly, but somehow delicately") and Le Chiffre's watchful presence create a sense of immediate danger. Bond's desperate attempt to escape and his hidden plan add to the suspense.
