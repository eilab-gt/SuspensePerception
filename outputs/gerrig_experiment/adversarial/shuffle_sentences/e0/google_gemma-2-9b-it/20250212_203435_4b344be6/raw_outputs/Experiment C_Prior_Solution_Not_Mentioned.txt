Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and resourcefulness (pulling the rug, trying to escape), he's clearly in a dangerous situation. Blofeld is aware of Bond's actions and has taken steps to restrain him.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension through:

* **Bond's capture:**  We see him taken prisoner and restrained.
* **Blofeld's threats:** Blofeld's words and actions ("eliminating irritations," the wire) create a sense of danger.
* **The dark setting:** The room's darkness adds to the uncertainty and fear.
* **Bond's limited options:**  He's trapped and outnumbered, making his escape seem difficult.
