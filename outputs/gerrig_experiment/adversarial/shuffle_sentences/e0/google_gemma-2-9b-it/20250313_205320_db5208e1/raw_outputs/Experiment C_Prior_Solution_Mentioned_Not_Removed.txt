Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and in a vulnerable position, the passage hints at his resourcefulness and ability to outsmart his captors.  The mention of his previous escape from Blofeld's guard suggests he might find a way out again.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, Blofeld is clearly menacing, and the description of Crushak's brutality adds to the suspense. However, it doesn't reach a level of extreme urgency or cliffhanger that would make it "very" or "extremely" suspenseful.
