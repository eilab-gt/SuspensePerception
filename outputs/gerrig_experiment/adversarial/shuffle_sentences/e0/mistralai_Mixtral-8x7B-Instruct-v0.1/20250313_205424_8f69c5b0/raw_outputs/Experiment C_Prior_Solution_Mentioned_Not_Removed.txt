 Answer Question 1: "Somewhat likely" - Although Bond has been captured and is currently a prisoner, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. However, the fact that he is currently tied up and outnumbered makes it uncertain how quickly or easily he will be able to escape.

Answer Question 2: "Very suspenseful" - The passage is suspenseful because Bond is in a dangerous situation and the reader is unsure of what will happen next. The use of descriptive language, such as "large and ugly man" and "bit more painfully into Bond's flesh," adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. Additionally, the fact that Bond was able to outwit Blofeld's guard in the past adds an element of uncertainty and raises the stakes for this encounter.
