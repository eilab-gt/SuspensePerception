 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history and expertise as a secret agent, it is not impossible for him to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely," with a score of 5.

Question 2: The passage does contain elements of suspense, as the reader is left wondering about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape from his captors. Additionally, the unexpected arrival of the bird and Bond's attempt to escape by pulling up a corner of the rug add to the tension. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "moderately suspenseful," with a score of 5.
