 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not specified how likely it is that Bond will escape from Blofeld. We know that Bond is currently being held captive and has been tied up, but there is no information about his plans to escape or any potential opportunities for escape. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Answer Question 2: In terms of suspense, the passage is somewhat suspenseful. While we don't know for sure what will happen to Bond, the fact that he is tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. Additionally, the sudden appearance of a large bird crashing into the window adds an element of surprise and unpredictability. However, without knowing more about the larger context of the story and what happens next, it is difficult to say for certain how suspenseful the passage is overall
