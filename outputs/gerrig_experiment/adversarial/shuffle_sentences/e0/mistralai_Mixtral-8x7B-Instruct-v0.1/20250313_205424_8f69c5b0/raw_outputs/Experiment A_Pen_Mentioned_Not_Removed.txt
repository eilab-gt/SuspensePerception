 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "very likely" (6).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond being held captive and his attempt to escape. The fact that Bond is actively trying to devise a plan to escape and the presence of danger with Le Chiffre and his gunmen contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would rate it as "very suspenseful" (6).
