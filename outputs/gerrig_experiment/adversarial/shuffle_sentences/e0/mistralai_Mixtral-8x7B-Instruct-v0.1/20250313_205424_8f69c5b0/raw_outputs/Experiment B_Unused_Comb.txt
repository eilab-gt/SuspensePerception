 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his men. However, Bond has shown his resourcefulness and combat skills in the excerpt, so there is a possibility that he might find a way to escape. Considering the information given, I would answer "moderately likely" for this question.
Question 2: As for the suspense level, the passage does contain elements of uncertainty and danger, with Bond being held captive and facing Le Chiffre's men. The situation is certainly tense and engaging, but without knowing the full context of the story, I would rate the suspense as "moderately suspenseful" for this particular passage.
