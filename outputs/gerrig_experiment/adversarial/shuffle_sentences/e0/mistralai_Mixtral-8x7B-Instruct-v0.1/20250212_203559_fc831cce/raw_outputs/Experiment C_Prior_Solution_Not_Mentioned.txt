 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been captured by Blofeld and is currently being held prisoner. Bond has tried to escape, but so far, his attempts have been unsuccessful. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as somewhat unlikely (option 2).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond is trying to escape from Blofeld's clutches. There are several elements of danger and uncertainty, such as the presence of gunmen and the risk of injury or death. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as moderately suspenseful (option 5).
