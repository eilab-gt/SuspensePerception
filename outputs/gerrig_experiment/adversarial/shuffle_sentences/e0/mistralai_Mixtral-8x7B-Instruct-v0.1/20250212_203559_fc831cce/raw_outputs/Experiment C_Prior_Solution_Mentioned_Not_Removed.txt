 Answer Question 1: "Somewhat likely" - Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. Blofeld himself acknowledges Bond's ability to outwit his captors. However, it's also important to note that Bond is currently injured and outnumbered, making the escape more challenging.

Answer Question 2: "Very suspenseful" - The passage contains several elements of suspense, such as Bond being injured, outnumbered, and in the dark about what Blofeld has planned for him. The author also uses foreshadowing, such as mentioning the death of Crushak, to build tension. Additionally, the fact that Bond has escaped from Blofeld before adds to the suspense, as readers wonder if he will be able to do so again.
