 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and dangerous situation, being held prisoner by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond does show some resourcefulness and resistance, such as kicking the thin man and attempting to run after Vesper. Considering these elements, I would answer "somewhat likely" for the question, as it's unclear what will happen next, but Bond has shown some ability to defend himself.

Answer Question 2: Given the circumstances presented in the passage, with Bond being held captive and physically threatened by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful." The author has effectively created a tense atmosphere, and the outcome of Bond's situation remains uncertain.
