 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we do not have enough context to determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond has been trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and the scene is described with words like "trapped", "puny and impotent", I would rate the suspense level as 6. Very suspenseful.
