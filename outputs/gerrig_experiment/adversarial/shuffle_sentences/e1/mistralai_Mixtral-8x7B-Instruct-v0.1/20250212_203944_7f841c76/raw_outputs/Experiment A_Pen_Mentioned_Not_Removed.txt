 Answer Question 1: Based on the provided excerpt, Bond is showing resistance and trying to escape, which indicates that he has not given up. However, he is currently outnumbered and unarmed, making it a challenging situation. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely" (option 2).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his men, and Vesper has been taken to another part of the house. There's a sense of uncertainty and danger, which creates suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
