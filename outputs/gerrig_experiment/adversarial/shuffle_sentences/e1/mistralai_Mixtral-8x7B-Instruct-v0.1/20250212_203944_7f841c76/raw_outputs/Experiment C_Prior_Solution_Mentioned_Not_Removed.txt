 Answer Question 1: "Somewhat likely" - Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. Blofeld himself acknowledges Bond's ability to outwit his captors. However, it's also important to note that Bond is physically restrained and outnumbered, making escape more challenging.

Answer Question 2: "Very suspenseful" - The passage contains several elements of suspense, such as the threat of violence, Bond's attempts to escape, and the presence of a new character (Crushak) who seems intent on harming Bond. The fact that Bond has escaped from Blofeld before adds to the suspense, as readers may wonder if he will be able to do so again.
