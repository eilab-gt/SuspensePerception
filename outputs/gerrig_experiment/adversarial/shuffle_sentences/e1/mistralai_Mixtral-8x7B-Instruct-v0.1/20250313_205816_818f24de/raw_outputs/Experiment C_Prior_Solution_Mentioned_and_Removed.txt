 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is not impossible for him to escape. A more neutral or uncertain answer might be the most appropriate in this case. Therefore, I would select "4. Neutral or Uncertain" for Question 1.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond is being held captive and subjected to increasingly painful restraints. The use of descriptive language and the sense of danger and uncertainty contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would select "5. Moderately suspenseful" for Question 2.
