 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been disarmed and is currently surrounded by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has proven to be a skilled and resourceful agent in the past. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as moderately likely (option 5).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The level of suspense is heightened by the fact that Bond has been disarmed and outnumbered. Overall, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as very suspenseful (option 6).
