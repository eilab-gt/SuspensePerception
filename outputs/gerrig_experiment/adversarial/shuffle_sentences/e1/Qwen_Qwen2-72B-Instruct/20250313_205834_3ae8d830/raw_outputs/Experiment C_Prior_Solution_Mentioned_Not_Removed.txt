***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured before and managed to escape, but the current situation with Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, is not fully described in terms of the security measures or Bond's resources.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, as Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemy, Blofeld. The sudden appearance of the bird and Bond's quick thinking to use the distraction to his advantage adds to the suspense, as does the description of Crushak's cruel method of restraining Bond. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape this time.
