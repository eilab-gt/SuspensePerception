Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and outnumbered, the passage highlights his resourcefulness and fighting skills. He managed to briefly disarm one of the gunmen and seems determined to escape.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The situation is clearly dangerous for Bond. He's captured, disarmed, and surrounded by hostile forces.  The short, clipped sentences and descriptions of the gunmen's actions create a sense of urgency and impending danger.
