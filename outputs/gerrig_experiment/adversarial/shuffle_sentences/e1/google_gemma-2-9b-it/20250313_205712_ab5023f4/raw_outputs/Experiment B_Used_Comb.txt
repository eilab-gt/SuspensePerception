Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and outnumbered, the passage hints at his resourcefulness and fighting ability. He manages to evade capture initially and even lands a blow on one of the gunmen.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The situation is clearly dangerous for Bond, and the passage builds tension by describing the gunmen's search and Le Chiffre's watchful presence.  However, Bond's quick thinking and unexpected actions provide a glimmer of hope, keeping the reader engaged but not completely on edge.
