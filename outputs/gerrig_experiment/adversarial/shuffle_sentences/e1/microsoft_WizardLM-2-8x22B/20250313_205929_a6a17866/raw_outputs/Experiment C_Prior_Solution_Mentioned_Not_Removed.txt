1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a skilled and resourceful agent, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Blofeld. Despite being captured and bound, Bond's history of getting out of tight situations suggests that he may have a plan or the ability to improvise one.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is in immediate danger, bound to a chair, and facing an adversary who is clearly prepared to use lethal force. The mention of a previous escape and the presence of a threatening henchman named Crushak add to the suspense, as does the dramatic moment when a large bird crashes into the glass wall, providing a potential distraction for Bond. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation, which contributes to a high level of suspense.
