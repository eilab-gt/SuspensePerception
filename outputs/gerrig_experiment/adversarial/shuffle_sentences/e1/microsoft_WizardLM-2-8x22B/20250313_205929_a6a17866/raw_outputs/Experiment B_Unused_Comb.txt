1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and searched by Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The mention of Bond's confidence and the subsequent search for weapons create a sense of impending danger and uncertainty, which contributes to a high level of suspense.
