***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. Although the passage describes Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape, given his character's reputation and the genre of the novel.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's precarious situation, with Blofeld and his gunmen holding him captive and threatening him with violence. The use of vivid details, such as the painful wire binding Bond's arms and the large, ugly man guarding the door, adds to the sense of danger and raises the stakes for Bond's escape. The passage effectively builds suspense and leaves the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape.
