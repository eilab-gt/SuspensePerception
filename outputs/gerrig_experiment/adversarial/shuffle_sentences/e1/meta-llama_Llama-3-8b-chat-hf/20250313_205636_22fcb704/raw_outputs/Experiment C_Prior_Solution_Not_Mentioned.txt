Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and pinned down by piano wire, with two gunmen and Blofeld himself pointing guns at him. The situation is dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of outside intervention or clever thinking.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation, with Bond trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of darkness, the sound of the gunshots, and the sudden appearance of the large bird crashing into the wall all contribute to a sense of high stakes and uncertainty. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament.
