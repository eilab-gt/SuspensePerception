Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Bond is being searched for any remaining weapons. This doesn't seem like a favorable situation for Bond to escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is being captured and searched, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid language, such as "Like lightning", "whistled past his hip", and "whistle of pain" adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The reader is also left wondering what Bond's plan is and how he will manage to escape from his captors.
