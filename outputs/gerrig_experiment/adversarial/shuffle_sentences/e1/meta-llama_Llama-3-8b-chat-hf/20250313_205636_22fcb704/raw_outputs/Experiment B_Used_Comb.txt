Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently trapped and being searched by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's situation as dire, with him being trapped and helpless against the three men. The use of phrases such as "Bond felt puny and impotent" and "He smiled broadly, and flipped the comb well out of Bond's reach" creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
