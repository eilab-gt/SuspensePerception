Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and pinned down by piano wire, with two gunmen guarding him. The fact that Blofeld has successfully laid a trap for Bond and has him at his mercy makes it unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "Each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh," adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The sudden introduction of new characters and plot twists, such as the bird crashing into the wall and the large man appearing at the door, keeps the reader on edge and makes it difficult to predict what will happen next.
