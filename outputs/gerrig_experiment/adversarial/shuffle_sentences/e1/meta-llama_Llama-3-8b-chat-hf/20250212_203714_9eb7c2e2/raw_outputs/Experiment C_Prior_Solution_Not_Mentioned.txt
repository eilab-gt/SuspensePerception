Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He is tied up and pinned in a chair, making it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has a clear advantage over Bond, having laid a successful trap for him. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is in control. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "very large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The sudden appearance of the bird crashing into the wall of glass also adds to the surprise and tension. The passage creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen next, making it extremely suspenseful.
