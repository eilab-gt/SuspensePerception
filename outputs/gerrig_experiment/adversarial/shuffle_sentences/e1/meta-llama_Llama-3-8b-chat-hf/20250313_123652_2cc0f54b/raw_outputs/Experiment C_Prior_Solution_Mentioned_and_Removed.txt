Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has a gun pointed at him. The situation seems dire, and Bond's chances of escape appear slim.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and the situation is escalating rapidly. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the "piece of piano wire" wrapped around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The sudden interruption by the bird crashing into the wall of glass also adds to the surprise and tension, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
