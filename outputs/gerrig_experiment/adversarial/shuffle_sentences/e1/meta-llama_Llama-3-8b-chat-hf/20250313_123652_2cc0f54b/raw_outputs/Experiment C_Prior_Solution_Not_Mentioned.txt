Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and pinned down by piano wire, with two gunmen and Blofeld himself surrounding him. The odds of him escaping from this situation seem low, especially since he's already been caught off guard and is at the mercy of his captors.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation, with Bond trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of dark lighting, the sound of a gun going off, and the sudden appearance of a large bird crashing into the wall all contribute to a sense of high stakes and uncertainty, making it a thrilling and suspenseful passage.
