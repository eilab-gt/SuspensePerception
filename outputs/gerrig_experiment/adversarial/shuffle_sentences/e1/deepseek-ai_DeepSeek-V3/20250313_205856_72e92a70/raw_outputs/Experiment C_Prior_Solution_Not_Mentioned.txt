***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tied up with piano wire, surrounded by Blofeld and his gunmen, and seems to have limited options for escape at this moment. The situation appears dire, making escape seem "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is filled with tensionâ€”Bond is restrained, Blofeld is threatening, and there are moments of chaos (e.g., the bird crashing into the glass, the light going out). These elements create a "very suspenseful" atmosphere.
