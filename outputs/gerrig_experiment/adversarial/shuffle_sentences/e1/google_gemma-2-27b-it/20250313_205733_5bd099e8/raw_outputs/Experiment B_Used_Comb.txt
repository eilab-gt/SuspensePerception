Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and outnumbered, he has shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past. The excerpt highlights his agility and quick thinking, suggesting he might find a way to outsmart his captors.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the description of Bond's capture and the menacing presence of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The sudden shift in power dynamic and Bond's vulnerability add to the tension. However, Bond's past successes and hints of his cunning leave room for hope, preventing the suspense from becoming overwhelming.
