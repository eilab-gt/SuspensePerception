Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and in a precarious situation, he is resourceful and has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations. The fact that he manages to pull up a corner of the rug suggests he's already looking for ways out.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, Blofeld is menacing, and there's a sense of danger and unpredictability. The sudden appearance of the bird and the darkness add to the suspenseful atmosphere.
