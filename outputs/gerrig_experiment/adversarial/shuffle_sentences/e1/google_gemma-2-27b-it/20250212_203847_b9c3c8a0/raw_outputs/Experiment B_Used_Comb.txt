Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is resourceful and has shown fighting ability, he's currently outnumbered and outgunned. The excerpt doesn't give enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the following:

* **Bond's capture:** He's been trapped by Le Chiffre and his men, creating a sense of danger.
* **Le Chiffre's control:** Le Chiffre's actions and dialogue portray him as a cunning and dangerous adversary.
* **Bond's vulnerability:**  The description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" highlights his current weakness. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore any other aspects of the passage!
