Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and restrained, he's shown resourcefulness and a knack for escaping tricky situations in the past. The excerpt hints at his potential for escape with the distraction caused by the bird and the mention of his previous escape from Blofeld's captivity.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, threatened, and physically restrained. The sudden appearance of the bird, the darkness, and Blofeld's menacing tone all contribute to a highly suspenseful atmosphere.  We're left wondering how Bond will get out of this dangerous situation.
