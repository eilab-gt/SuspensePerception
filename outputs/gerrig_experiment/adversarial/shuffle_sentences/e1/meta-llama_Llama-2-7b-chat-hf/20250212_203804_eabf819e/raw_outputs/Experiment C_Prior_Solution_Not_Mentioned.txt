  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to outsmart Blofeld in the past, Blofeld has also proven to be a formidable opponent who is not afraid to use violence to get what he wants. In this passage, Blofeld has already laid a successful trap for Bond and has him and Vesper under his control, so it's unclear how Bond will be able to escape.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and uncertainty, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of tension create a sense of urgency and danger, making it difficult to predict what will happen next. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and the outcome of the situation
