  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to outwit Blofeld in the past, he is currently in a difficult situation and it's unclear how he will be able to escape.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". There are hints of danger and uncertainty, but the passage also provides some information about Blofeld's plan and the characters' motivations, which can make it feel less suspenseful. However, the passage does build tension as Bond tries to escape from his captors, so it's not completely devoid of suspense.
