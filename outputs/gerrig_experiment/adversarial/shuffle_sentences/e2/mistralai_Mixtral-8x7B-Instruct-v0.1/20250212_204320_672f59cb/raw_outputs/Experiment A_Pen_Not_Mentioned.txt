 Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it seems that Bond is making an attempt to escape from Le Chiffre and his men, so there is a possibility that he might succeed. However, since he is currently outnumbered and unarmed, it's still uncertain how likely it is that he will escape. Therefore, I would answer Question 1 as:
4. Neutral or Uncertain.

As for Question 2, the excerpt describes a tense and action-packed scene where Bond is trying to escape from his captors, so I would rate the level of suspense as:
6. Very suspenseful.
