 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is able to create some diversions and disruptions, but he has not yet escaped. The text does not provide information about the outcome of the situation, but it is clear that Bond is still in danger and has not successfully escaped. Therefore, I would answer "somewhat likely" or "slightly likely" for question 1, as it is unclear at this point whether Bond will be able to escape.

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation in which Bond is being held captive by a criminal figure and his gunmen. There are several moments of tension and suspense, such as when Bond is being tied up and when he tries to escape. The use of descriptive language and the inclusion of specific details also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would answer "moderately suspenseful" or "very suspenseful" for question 2.
