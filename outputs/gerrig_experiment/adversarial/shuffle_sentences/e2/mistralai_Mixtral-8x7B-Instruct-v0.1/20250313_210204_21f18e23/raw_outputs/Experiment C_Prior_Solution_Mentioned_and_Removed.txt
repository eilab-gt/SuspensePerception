 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Bond is currently a prisoner and in a seemingly precarious situation, he has a history of escaping from dangerous situations and outwitting his enemies. However, there are many variables at play and the outcome is uncertain.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of danger as Bond is held captive by Blofeld and his men. The use of descriptive language and specific details helps to bring the scene to life and engage the reader's senses. Additionally, the fact that Bond has been able to escape from Blofeld in the past adds an element of uncertainty and raises the stakes for this encounter. Overall, the passage is well-written and effectively creates a sense of suspense and excitement.
