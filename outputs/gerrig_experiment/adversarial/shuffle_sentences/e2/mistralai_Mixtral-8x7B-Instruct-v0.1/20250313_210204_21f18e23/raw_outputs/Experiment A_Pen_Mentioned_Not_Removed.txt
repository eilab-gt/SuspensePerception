 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "very likely" (6).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being held captive and disarmed. The fact that Bond is already planning his escape and looking for weaponry adds to the tension. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (6).
