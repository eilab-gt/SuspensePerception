 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not specified if Bond will escape from Blofeld or not. It depends on the events that will occur next in the story.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The author describes how Bond is captured, tied up, and threatened by Blofeld and his men, which creates a sense of tension and uncertainty for the reader.
