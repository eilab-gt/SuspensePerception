 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is trying to escape and even manages to injure one of his captors and kick another, but he is ultimately recaptured and searched for other weapons. Given this information, I would answer "2. Somewhat likely" for the question of how likely it is that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, the passage describes a tense situation in which Bond is trying to escape and there is a sense of uncertainty about whether he will be successful. Additionally, the use of descriptive language such as "he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand" adds to the tension. Therefore, I would answer "5. Moderately suspenseful" for the question of how suspenseful I find this passage to be.
