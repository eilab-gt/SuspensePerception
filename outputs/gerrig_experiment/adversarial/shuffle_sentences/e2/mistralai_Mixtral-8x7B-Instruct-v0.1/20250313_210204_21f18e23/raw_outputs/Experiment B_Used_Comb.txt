 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not provide enough details about the situation or Bond's plans.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond has been disarmed, outnumbered, and trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, I would rate the suspense level as 6. Very suspenseful.
