  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to outwit Blofeld in the past, he is currently in a difficult situation and it's unclear how he will be able to escape.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there are some tense moments, such as Bond's struggle against the wire and the arrival of the large man, the passage does not feel overly suspenseful overall.
