**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently in a precarious situation, he's known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet. The fact that he used the bird distraction to pull up the rug suggests he's already looking for ways to escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, threatened, and restrained. The description of Crushak and Blofeld's demeanor adds to the sense of danger. The sudden appearance of the bird and the ensuing chaos create a sense of unpredictability, keeping the reader on edge.
