Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and in a precarious situation, he's known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet. The fact that he managed to pull up the rug and momentarily gain an advantage suggests he might find another way out.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, Blofeld is clearly dangerous and ruthless, and the description of Crushak adds to the sense of threat. The sudden appearance of the bird and the mention of Bond's previous escape create a sense of unpredictability, keeping the reader on edge.
