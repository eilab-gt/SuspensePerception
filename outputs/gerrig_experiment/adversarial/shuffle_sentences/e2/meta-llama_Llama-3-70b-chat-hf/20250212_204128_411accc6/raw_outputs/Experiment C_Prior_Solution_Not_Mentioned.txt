***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it is typical of the Bond franchise for him to escape from seemingly impossible situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly man" and "piano wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will escape, which adds to the suspense.
