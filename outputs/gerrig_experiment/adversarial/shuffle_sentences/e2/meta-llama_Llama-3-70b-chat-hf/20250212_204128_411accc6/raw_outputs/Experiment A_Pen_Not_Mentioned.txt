***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, and the passage shows him already thinking of ways to escape and cause damage to his captors. He has a plan to exchange words with Vesper and is actively trying to create opportunities to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond being searched, dragged around, and trying to escape. The use of words like "whistled", "slammed", "crashed", and "hurled" creates a sense of urgency and intensity. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.
