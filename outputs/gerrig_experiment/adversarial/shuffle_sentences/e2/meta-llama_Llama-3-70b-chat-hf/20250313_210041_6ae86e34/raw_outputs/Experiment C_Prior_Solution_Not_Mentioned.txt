***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's typical of the Bond franchise for him to escape from seemingly impossible situations. Although the passage presents a dire situation for Bond, it's likely that he will find a way to escape or be rescued.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's precarious situation, with him being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid details, such as the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of danger and urgency. The sudden interruption by the bird crashing into the wall of glass also adds to the sense of unpredictability and raises questions about what will happen next.
