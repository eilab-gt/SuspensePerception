Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he displays his characteristic resourcefulness and fighting skills. He manages to quickly react to the ambush, disarm one of the gunmen, and subtly conceal a weapon. This suggests he's not going down without a fight and has a chance of escaping.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is packed with action and tension. We see Bond caught off guard, struggling against his captors, and desperately trying to gain an advantage. The short, clipped sentences and descriptions of quick movements create a sense of urgency and keep the reader on edge, wondering what will happen next.
