Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, the excerpt shows him to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He manages to subtly conceal a weapon, anticipates Le Chiffre's moves, and even uses a distraction to make a run for it.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. We see Bond captured, Le Chiffre's menacing presence, the threat of violence, and Bond's desperate attempt to escape. The short, action-packed sentences and descriptions like "like lightning" and "brusquely" contribute to the feeling of urgency and danger.
