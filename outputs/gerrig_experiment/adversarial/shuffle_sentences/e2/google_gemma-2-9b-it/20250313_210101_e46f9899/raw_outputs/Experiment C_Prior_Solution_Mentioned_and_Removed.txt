Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is currently in a precarious situation, the excerpt hints at his resourcefulness. He's already managed to create a distraction and exploit a moment of Blofeld's vulnerability.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, Blofeld is clearly dangerous, and the situation is escalating quickly. The descriptions of the wire tightening and the gun pointed at Bond's chest create a strong sense of immediacy and danger. 


Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of the choices further!
