Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped, surrounded by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and has been disarmed. He is unable to escape or defend himself, making it unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the scene, including the use of words like "roughly" and "puny", adds to the sense of unease and fear. The sudden and unexpected twist at the end, where Bond whips around and kicks one of the gunmen, adds to the suspense and makes the reader feel like anything can happen.
