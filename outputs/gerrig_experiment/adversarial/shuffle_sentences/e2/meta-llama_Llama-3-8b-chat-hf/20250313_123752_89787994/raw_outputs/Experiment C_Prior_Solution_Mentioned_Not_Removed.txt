Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other guard. Bond is also being restrained by piano wire, making it difficult for him to move or escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, and that Blofeld is determined to eliminate him. The sudden appearance of the bird crashing into the wall of glass adds to the surprise and suspense, and the revelation that Bond has managed to find a way to escape and counterattack creates a sense of excitement and anticipation. The passage is well-written and effectively builds tension, making it extremely suspenseful.
