Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being led away. Bond has just been disarmed and is being dragged to his feet. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his captors at this point.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and being led away by their captors. The tension is heightened by the fact that Bond is trying to find a way to escape, and the reader is left wondering if he will be able to succeed. The use of action-packed language, such as "Like lightning", "whistled past his hip", and "crashed to the ground" adds to the sense of urgency and suspense.
