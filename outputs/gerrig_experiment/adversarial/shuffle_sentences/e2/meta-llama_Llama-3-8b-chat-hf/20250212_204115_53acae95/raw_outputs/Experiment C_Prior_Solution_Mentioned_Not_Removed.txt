Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is facing two gunmen, including Crushak, who has been tasked with keeping him captive. The situation seems dire, and Bond's chances of escape appear slim.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful, with Bond being trapped, pinned down, and facing two gunmen. The sudden introduction of a new character, the large and ugly man, adds to the tension and uncertainty, making it difficult to predict what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" and "the large man contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
