Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Blofeld is determined to eliminate them. The use of dark and dim lighting, the presence of guns, and the physical constraints on Bond all contribute to a sense of foreboding and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive the situation.
