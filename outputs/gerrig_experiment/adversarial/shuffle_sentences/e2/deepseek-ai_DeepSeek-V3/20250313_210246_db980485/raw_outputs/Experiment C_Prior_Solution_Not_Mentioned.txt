***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful  

**Explanation:**  
1. Bond is in a precarious situation, tied up and surrounded by Blofeld and his men. However, Bond is resourceful and has already taken advantage of distractions (e.g., the bird crashing into the glass). This suggests he has a moderate chance of escaping.  
2. The passage is very suspenseful due to the tension of Bond being restrained, the threat of violence, and the unpredictable actions of Blofeld and his men. The dark room, the gun pointed at Bond, and the sudden distractions all contribute to a high level of suspense.
