***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely  
**Reasoning:** Bond is in a precarious situation, tied up and under the watch of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, Bond has a history of resourcefulness and has already taken advantage of a distraction (the bird crashing into the window) to create an opportunity. This suggests that while escape is not guaranteed, it is plausible given Bond's skills and the chaotic situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful  
**Reasoning:** The passage is filled with tensionâ€”Bond is tied up, Blofeld is threatening, and the situation escalates with the bird crashing into the window and Bond's attempt to escape. The uncertainty of Bond's fate and the high-stakes nature of the confrontation create a strong sense of suspense
