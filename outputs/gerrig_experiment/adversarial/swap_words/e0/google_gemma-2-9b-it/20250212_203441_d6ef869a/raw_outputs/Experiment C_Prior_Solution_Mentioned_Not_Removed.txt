Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured and tied up,  Fleming's writing often suggests that Bond is resourceful and capable of overcoming seemingly impossible odds.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, Blofeld is clearly a dangerous adversary, and the description of the scene (the dark office, the guns, the wire) adds to the feeling of unease. However, it lacks the immediate, heart-pounding action that would make it extremely suspenseful.
