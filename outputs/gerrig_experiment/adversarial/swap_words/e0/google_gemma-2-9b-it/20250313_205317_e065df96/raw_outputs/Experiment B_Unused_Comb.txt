Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to avoid serious injury despite being caught off guard.  However, he's outnumbered and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, who seems to have planned this carefully.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage sets up a clear conflict and danger for Bond. We know he's trapped, and Le Chiffre's demeanor suggests he intends to make things difficult for Bond.  There's a sense of anticipation about what Le Chiffre will do next and how Bond will react.
