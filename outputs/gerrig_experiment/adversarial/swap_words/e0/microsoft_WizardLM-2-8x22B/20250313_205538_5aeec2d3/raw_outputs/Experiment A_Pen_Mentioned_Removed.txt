1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and experience in dangerous situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament. The fact that he has already managed to cause some confusion and has a history of getting out of tight spots suggests that he has a fighting chance.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The detailed description of the quick and violent exchange, Bond's calculated actions, and the uncertainty of the outcome all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be on edge, wondering how Bond will manage to turn the tables and whether he and Vesper will make it out alive.
