1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a skilled and resourceful agent, it is reasonable to assume that there is a moderate likelihood that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The passage describes a situation where Bond is already attempting to resist and cause disruption, which suggests that he is actively seeking an opportunity to turn the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The detailed description of Bond's actions as he tries to cause a distraction and the mention of the gunmen's search for weapons create a sense of immediacy and peril that is typical of suspenseful scenes in thrillers.
