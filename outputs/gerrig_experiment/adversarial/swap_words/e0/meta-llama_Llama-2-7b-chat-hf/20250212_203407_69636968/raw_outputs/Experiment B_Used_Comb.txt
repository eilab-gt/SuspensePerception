Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely." Although Bond has been trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, he is a skilled and resourceful agent who has shown himself to be able to think on his feet and come up with creative solutions to problems. Additionally, he has a reputation for being able to escape from difficult situations, so it is possible that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful." The passage sets the stage for a tense and dangerous situation, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of language and description creates a sense of urgency and danger, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from this situation. However, the passage does not reach a climax or resolution
