Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to bring about Blofeld's gambling losses, Blofeld has laid a successful trap for him and has him and Vesper as his prisoners. However, Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, and he may be able to find a way to escape or outsmart Blofeld.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency in the passage, as Bond and Vesper are trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen, the suspense is not at its highest level. The passage does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of unease, but it does not reach the level of extreme suspense found in some other passages in the novel.
