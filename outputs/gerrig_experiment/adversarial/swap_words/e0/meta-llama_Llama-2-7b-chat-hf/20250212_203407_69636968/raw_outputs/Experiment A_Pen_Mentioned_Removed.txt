Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to outsmart Le Chiffre and acquire a weapon, he is still a prisoner of Le Chiffre's and his two gunmen. Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, and it is unclear how Bond will be able to escape from his current situation.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency in the passage, the outcome is not entirely clear, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's trap. The use of descriptive language and the tension between Bond and Le Chiffre help to build suspense and keep the reader engaged.
