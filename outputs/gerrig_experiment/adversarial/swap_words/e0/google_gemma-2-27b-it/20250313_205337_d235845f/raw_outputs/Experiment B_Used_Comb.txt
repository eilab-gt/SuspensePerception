Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and seems outmatched, he's shown resourcefulness and physical prowess in the past. It's unlikely he'll stay a prisoner indefinitely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden ambush. The description of the gunmen and Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor creates a sense of danger. The ending leaves the reader wondering what Le Chiffre's plans are and how Bond will react.
