Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is known for his resourcefulness and skill, he's currently outnumbered, disarmed, and in a precarious situation. The excerpt doesn't give us enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond is captured, disarmed, and at the mercy of his enemies. The description of the gunmen and Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor heightens the suspense. The abrupt ending leaves the reader wondering what will happen next, further increasing the suspense.
