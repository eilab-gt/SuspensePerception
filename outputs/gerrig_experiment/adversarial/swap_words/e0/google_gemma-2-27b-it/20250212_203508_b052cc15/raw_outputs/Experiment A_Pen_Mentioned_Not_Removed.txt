Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is captured and seems to be in a precarious situation, he is resourceful and has shown quick thinking and agility in the past. This suggests he might find a way to escape, but it won't be easy.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, physically assaulted, and threatened. The description of Le Chiffre's cold demeanor and the gunmen's brutality adds to the suspense. The ending, with Le Chiffre's invitation to "waste not time," leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, eager to know what will happen next.
