Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and restrained, he is James Bond.  He's known for his resourcefulness and ability to get out of tight spots. The fact that he managed to briefly create a distraction by knocking over a lamp suggests he's still looking for opportunities.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is quite tense. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and bound. Blofeld's calm demeanor and threats create a sense of unease. The description of Bond being tied up and the mention of pain add to the suspense.
