Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being searched, which doesn't bode well for his chances of escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense scene where Bond is being held captive and disarmed. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "Three large guns men through, leapt opponent" and "Bond crashed minimal in agilely damage" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or not.
