Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. The situation is dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense scene where Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large bird" and "ugly man", creates a sense of unease and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is in a vulnerable position adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
