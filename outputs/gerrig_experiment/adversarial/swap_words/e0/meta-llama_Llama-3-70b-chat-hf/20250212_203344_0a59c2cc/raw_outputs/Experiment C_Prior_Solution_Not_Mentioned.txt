***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond is in a precarious situation, being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen, it's also a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from difficult situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's capture and the brutal treatment he receives at the hands of Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of vivid language, such as "pinned carefully", "piano wire", "twist painfully", and "grunted", adds to the sense of danger and discomfort, making the reader feel anxious about Bond's fate.
