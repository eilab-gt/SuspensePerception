 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not provide enough context regarding Bond's situation or his abilities to escape. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Question 2: The suspense level of a passage depends on the reader's interpretation. However, given that Bond is a well-known fictional character who often finds himself in dangerous situations and manages to escape, some readers may find this passage suspenseful. Therefore, I would select option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
