 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his men. There is no mention of Bond attempting to escape or any plans for escape, so it is difficult to say how likely it is that he will escape. However, given Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is possible that he may find a way to escape. I would rate the likelihood as "somewhat likely" (option 2).

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation in which Bond is being held captive and threatened by Blofeld. The level of suspense in a passage can be subjective and depends on the reader's interpretation, but I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6). The passage contains elements of danger, uncertainty, and high stakes, which all contribute to a sense of suspense.
