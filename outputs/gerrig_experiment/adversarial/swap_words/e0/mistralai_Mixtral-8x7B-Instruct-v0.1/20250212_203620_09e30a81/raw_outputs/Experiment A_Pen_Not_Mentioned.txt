 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not contain any information about the outcome of their encounter.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and there is a tense exchange between them, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 6. Very suspenseful. The situation is dangerous and uncertain, and the outcome is not clear, which creates a tense and anxious atmosphere for the reader.
