 **Question 1:** Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not contain any information about Bond's current situation or resources. However, given Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, one might lean towards "moderately likely" or "very likely" that he will find a way to escape.

**Question 2:** The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Blofeld, but it does not contain any immediate danger or action, so it might be considered "somewhat suspenseful" or "slightly suspenseful". The real suspense comes from the anticipation of what will happen next in their captivity.
