Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, the excerpt doesn't paint a completely hopeless picture.  Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage effectively builds tension. We see Bond captured, Blofeld's menacing demeanor, and the threat of violence. The description of the wire being twisted into Bond's flesh adds a visceral element to the suspense. 


Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of the details further!
