Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and outnumbered, the excerpt highlights his agility and quick thinking.  He managed to avoid serious injury despite being caught off guard.  This suggests he might find a way to outsmart Le Chiffre and his men.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and at the mercy of Le Chiffre.  The description of the ambush and the search for weapons heightens the feeling of danger. However, it doesn't reach a peak of extreme suspense yet.
