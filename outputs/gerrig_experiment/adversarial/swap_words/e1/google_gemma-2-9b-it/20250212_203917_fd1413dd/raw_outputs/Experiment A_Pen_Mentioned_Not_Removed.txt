Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is in a precarious situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He managed to evade immediate capture and potentially disarm the gunmen.  However, he's outnumbered and Le Chiffre seems to be in control. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of a cunning adversary. The short, clipped sentences and descriptions of physical action heighten the tension.  We're left wondering how Bond will escape this situation.
