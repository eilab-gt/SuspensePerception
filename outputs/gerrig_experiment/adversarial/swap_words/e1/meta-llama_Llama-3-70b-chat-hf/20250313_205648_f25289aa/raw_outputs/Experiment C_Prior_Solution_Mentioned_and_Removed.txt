***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and it's difficult to predict whether he will escape or not. The passage doesn't provide enough information to lean one way or the other, so I'm opting for a neutral or uncertain answer.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of vivid language, such as "pinned Bond up in the chair", "wire carefully twisted into each arm", and "piano wire bit painfully into his flesh" creates a sense of tension and danger
