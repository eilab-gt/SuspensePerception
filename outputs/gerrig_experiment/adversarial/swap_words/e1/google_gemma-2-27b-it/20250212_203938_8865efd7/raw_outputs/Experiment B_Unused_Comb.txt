Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is known for his resourcefulness and skill, he's currently outnumbered, disarmed, and in a precarious situation. The excerpt doesn't give us enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through several elements:

* **Sudden shift in power:** Bond goes from a confident gambler to a captured prisoner in a matter of moments.
* **Le Chiffre's menacing presence:** His actions and words ("Let's not waste time") suggest a dangerous and ruthless character.
* **Bond's vulnerability:**  He's disarmed and physically overpowered, leaving the reader wondering how he'll get out of this situation. 
* **Open ending:** The passage ends with Bond feeling "impotent" and Le Chiffre ready to act, leaving the reader on a cliffhanger.
