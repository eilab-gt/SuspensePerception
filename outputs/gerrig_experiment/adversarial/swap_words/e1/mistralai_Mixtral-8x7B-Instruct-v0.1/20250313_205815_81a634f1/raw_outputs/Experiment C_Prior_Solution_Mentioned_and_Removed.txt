 **Question 1:** Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not contain any details about Bond's plans or capabilities to escape. However, considering Bond's skills and experiences in similar situations throughout the series, one might lean towards "moderately likely" or "very likely".

**Question 2:** The suspense level in this passage can be considered "very suspenseful" or "extremely suspenseful". The author has effectively created tension by describing Bond and Vesper being captured by Blofeld and his gunmen, with no clear indication of how they will escape from this dangerous situation.
