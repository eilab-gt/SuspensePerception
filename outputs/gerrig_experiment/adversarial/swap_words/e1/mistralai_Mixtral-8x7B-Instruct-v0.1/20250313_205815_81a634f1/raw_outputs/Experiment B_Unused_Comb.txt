 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not provide information on any plans or possibilities for an escape.

Question 2: Considering the fact that James Bond, the main character, has been captured by a villain and disarmed, with no immediate escape plan provided in the excerpt, I would rate the suspense as a 6 - "Very Suspenseful". The situation is tense and unfavorable for Bond, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.
