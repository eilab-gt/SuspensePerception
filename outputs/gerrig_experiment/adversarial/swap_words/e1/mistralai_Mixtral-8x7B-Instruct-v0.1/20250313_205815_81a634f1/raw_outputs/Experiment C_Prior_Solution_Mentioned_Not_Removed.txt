 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not provide enough context or information about the situation's outcome. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Question 2: The suspense level of a passage can be subjective and depends on the reader's interpretation. However, given that Bond is a well-known fictional character who often finds himself in dangerous situations and manages to escape, some readers might find this passage suspenseful. Therefore, I would select option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
