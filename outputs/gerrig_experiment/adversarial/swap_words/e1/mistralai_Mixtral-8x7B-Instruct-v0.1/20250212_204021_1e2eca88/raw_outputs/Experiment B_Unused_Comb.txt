 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not provide information on any plans or possibilities for an escape.

Question 2: Considering the fact that James Bond, the main character, has been captured by a villain and disarmed, with no immediate escape plan or assistance in sight, I would find this passage to be "Very Suspenseful" (option 6).
