 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not provide enough context or information about Bond's current situation or his abilities to escape. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Question 2: The suspense level of a passage depends on the reader's interpretation and engagement with the text. The excerpt provided sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Blofeld, which could be considered suspenseful. However, without knowing the outcome, it is difficult to determine the level of suspense. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."
