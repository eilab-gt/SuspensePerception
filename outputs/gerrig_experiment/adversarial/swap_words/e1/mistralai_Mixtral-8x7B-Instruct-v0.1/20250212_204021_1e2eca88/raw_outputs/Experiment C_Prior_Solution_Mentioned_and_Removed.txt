 **Question 1:** Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not contain any details about Bond's plans or capabilities to escape. However, considering Bond's skills and experiences in similar situations throughout the series, one might lean towards "moderately likely" or "somewhat likely".

**Question 2:** The suspense level in this passage can be considered "very suspenseful" or "extremely suspenseful". The author has effectively created tension by describing how Bond and Vesper have fallen into a trap set by Blofeld, becoming his prisoners. The danger they are in is heightened by the presence of armed gunmen. This would naturally lead readers to feel anxious about the characters' safety and curious about how they will manage to escape.
