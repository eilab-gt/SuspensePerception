Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to evade Le Chiffre's gunmen and trap him in the hotel room, Le Chiffre is a skilled criminal and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to outsmart him for long. Le Chiffre has already laid a successful trap for Bond, and it's possible that he will continue to outmaneuver Bond and prevent him from escaping.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Moderately suspenseful". While Bond and Vesper are in a dangerous situation and Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre, the passage doesn't provide any explicit details about what will happen next, which keeps the reader in suspense. The passage does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of uncertainty, which makes it moderately suspenseful.
