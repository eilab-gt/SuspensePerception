Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to bring about Blofeld's gambling losses, Blofeld has laid a successful trap for him and has him and Vesper as his prisoners. Blofeld seems to have the upper hand in this situation, and it may be difficult for Bond to escape from him.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency in the passage, as Bond and Vesper are trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen, the suspense is not as high as it could be. The passage does not have a sense of urgency or tension that would make it extremely suspenseful.
