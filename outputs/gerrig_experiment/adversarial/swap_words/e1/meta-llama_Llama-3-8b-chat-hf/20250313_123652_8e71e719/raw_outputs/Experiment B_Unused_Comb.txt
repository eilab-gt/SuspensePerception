Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being searched, which doesn't bode well for his chances of escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a vulnerable position, and the description of the gunmen's actions and Le Chiffre's taunts adds to the sense of unease. The use of vivid language, such as "whirled of caught", "sharply", and "crashed minimal in agilely" also helps to create a sense of urgency and danger.
