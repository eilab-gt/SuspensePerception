Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is full of intense action, with Bond and Vesper being captured and searched, and the tension is palpable. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "spidery at summons", "hurried shoe", and "whistled Corsican wall" adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
