Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been caught off guard and is at a disadvantage. Given the circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden appearance of the gunmen, Bond's disarming, and his subsequent search and humiliation all contribute to a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
