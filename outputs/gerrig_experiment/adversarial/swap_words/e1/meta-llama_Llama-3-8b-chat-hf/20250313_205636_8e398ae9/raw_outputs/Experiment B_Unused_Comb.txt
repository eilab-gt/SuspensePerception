Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being surrounded by Le Chiffre's gunmen and having been disarmed. The fact that he was caught off guard and injured (although not seriously) suggests that his chances of escape are low.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a life-threatening situation, and the description of the events is vivid and intense. The use of words like "leapt", "whirled", "shove", and "crashed" creates a sense of urgency and chaos, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing the danger and uncertainty.
