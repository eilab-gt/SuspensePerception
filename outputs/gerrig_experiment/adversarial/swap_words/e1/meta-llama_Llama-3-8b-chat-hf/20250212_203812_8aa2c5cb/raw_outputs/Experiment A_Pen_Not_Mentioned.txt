Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, being prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. They are being searched and disarmed, and it's unclear how they will escape or turn the situation around. Given the circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense scene where Bond and Vesper are in danger. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "spidery at summons", "hurried shoe", and "whistled Corsican wall" creates a sense of urgency and chaos. The fact that Bond is being disarmed and searched, and that Le Chiffre is gloating, adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty, making the reader feel on edge and eager to know what will happen next.
