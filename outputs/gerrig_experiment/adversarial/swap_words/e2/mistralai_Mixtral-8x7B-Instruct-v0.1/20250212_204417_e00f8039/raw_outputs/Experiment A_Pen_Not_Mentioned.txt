 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we do not have enough details about Bond's current situation or his capabilities at this point. However, considering that he is a skilled MI6 agent, it can be assumed that he has a chance of escaping. A more specific answer would require additional context or information.

Question 2: Considering the elements of intrigue, danger, and uncertainty presented in the passage, I would rate the level of suspense as moderately suspenseful. This could change based on further details about Bond's situation and the events that follow.
