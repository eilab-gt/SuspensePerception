 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not contain any information about the outcome of their encounter.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they are in a vulnerable and uncertain situation, I would rate the suspense level as 6. Very suspenseful. The excerpt describes a tense and high-stakes situation, and the reader is left wondering about what will happen next.
