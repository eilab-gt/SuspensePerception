 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we do not have enough context to determine the outcome of the situation between Bond and Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's skills and history, one might assume that there is a possibility for him to escape or turn the situation around. A more specific answer would require additional context or information not provided in the excerpt.

Question 2: The suspense level in this passage can be subjective and depends on the reader's perspective. However, given that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and there is a tense confrontation happening, one could argue that the passage is at least "Moderately suspenseful" (option 5).
