 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not contain any information about Bond's plans or potential rescue.

Question 2: Considering the fact that James Bond, the main character, has been captured by the antagonist and is in a potentially dangerous situation, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 6. "Very suspenseful". The excerpt describes a tense scene where Bond is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, which creates a sense of uncertainty and anticipation for the reader.
