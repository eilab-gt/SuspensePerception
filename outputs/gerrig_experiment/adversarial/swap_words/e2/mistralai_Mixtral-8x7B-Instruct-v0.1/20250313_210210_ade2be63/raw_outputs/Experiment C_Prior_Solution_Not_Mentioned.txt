 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his men. There is no mention of Bond attempting to escape or any plans for escape, so it is difficult to say how likely it is that he will escape. However, given Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is possible that he may find a way to escape. I would rate the likelihood as "somewhat likely" (option 2).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his men. The description of the room and the actions of the characters create a sense of uncertainty and tension. I would rate the suspense level as "moderately suspenseful" (option 5).
