Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows impressive agility and manages to inflict some damage, he's clearly outnumbered and outgunned. The situation seems dire, but Bond's resourcefulness and past successes suggest a slight chance of escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with action and tension. Bond's capture, the violence, and the uncertainty of his fate create a highly suspenseful atmosphere.
