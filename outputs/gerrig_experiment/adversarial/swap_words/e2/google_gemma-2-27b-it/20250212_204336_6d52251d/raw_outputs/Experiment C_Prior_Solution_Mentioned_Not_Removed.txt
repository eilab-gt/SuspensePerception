Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

The passage describes Bond being captured and restrained. While Bond is resourceful, Blofeld seems to be in control and prepared.  We don't have enough information to judge Bond's chances of escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through:

* **Bond's capture:** He's clearly in a dangerous situation.
* **Blofeld's control:** Blofeld appears cunning and in charge.
* **The mention of a previous "accident":** This hints at Blofeld's ruthlessness.

However, we don't yet know the full extent of Blofeld's plans or Bond's potential for resistance, so the suspense isn't overwhelming.
