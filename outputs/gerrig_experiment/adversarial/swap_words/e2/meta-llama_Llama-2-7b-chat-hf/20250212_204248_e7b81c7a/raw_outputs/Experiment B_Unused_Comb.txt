Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to evade Le Chiffre's gunmen and trap him in the hotel room, Le Chiffre is a skilled criminal and it's unclear how Bond will be able to escape without any weapons or help.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Moderately suspenseful". While Bond is in a dangerous situation and being held captive by Le Chiffre, the passage doesn't provide any clear indication of how he will escape or if he will be able to escape at all. The suspense is building as the reader waits to see what will happen next, but it's not at an extremely high level.
