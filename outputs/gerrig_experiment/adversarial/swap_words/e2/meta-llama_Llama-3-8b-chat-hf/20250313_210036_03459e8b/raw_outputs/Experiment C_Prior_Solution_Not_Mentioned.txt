Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that Bond is in a difficult and precarious situation, making it unlikely that he will escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Bond is being subjected to physical torture and humiliation. The use of vivid and graphic descriptions, such as the "piano wire" and "painfully flesh", adds to the sense of suspense and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive the ordeal.
