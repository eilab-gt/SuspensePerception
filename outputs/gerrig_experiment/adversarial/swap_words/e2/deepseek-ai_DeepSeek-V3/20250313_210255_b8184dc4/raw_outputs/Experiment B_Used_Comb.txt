**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**  
4. Neutral or Uncertain  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**  
5. Moderately suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- For Question 1, the passage does not provide enough information to determine Bond's likelihood of escape. He is currently trapped and disarmed, but his resourcefulness and skills are not yet fully tested in this situation, leaving the outcome uncertain.  
- For Question 2, the passage is moderately suspenseful due to the tension of Bond being captured and searched, but it does not reach the highest levels of suspense as the immediate threat is controlled and Bond has not yet attempted to escape.
