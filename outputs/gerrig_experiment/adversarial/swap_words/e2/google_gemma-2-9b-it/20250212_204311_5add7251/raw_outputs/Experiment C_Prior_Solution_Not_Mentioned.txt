Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, he's resourceful and skilled.  Fleming often sets Bond up against seemingly insurmountable odds, but Bond usually finds a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of danger and tension. Bond is captured, tied up, and Blofeld's menacing demeanor adds to the suspense. However, it lacks the immediate, heart-pounding action that would make it extremely suspenseful.
