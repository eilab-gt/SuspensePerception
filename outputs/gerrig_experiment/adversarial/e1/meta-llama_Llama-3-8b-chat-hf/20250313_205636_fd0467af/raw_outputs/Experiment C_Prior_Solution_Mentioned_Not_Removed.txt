Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has a large and ugly man dedicated to eliminating Bond. This does not bode well for Bond's chances of escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's words are menacing and threatening. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape.
