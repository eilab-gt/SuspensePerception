Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched for any remaining weapons. This doesn't look like a promising situation for Bond's escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond is trying to escape, but he's being caught and searched by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he'll be caught and possibly harmed. The use of vivid descriptions and the fast-paced action also adds to the suspense.
