Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is being guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak who has orders to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's captivity.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and is being threatened by a ruthless and sadistic villain. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors.
