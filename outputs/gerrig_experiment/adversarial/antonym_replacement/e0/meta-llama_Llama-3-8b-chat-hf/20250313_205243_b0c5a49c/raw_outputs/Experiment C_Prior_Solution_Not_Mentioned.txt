Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. Bond is also being restrained by piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to move or escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held captive by Blofeld, who is not pleased with his actions. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors.
