Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has a large and ugly gunman dedicated to eliminating Bond. The situation seems dire, and Bond's chances of escape appear slim.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and the reader is aware that he is in a precarious situation. The description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, adds to the sense of unease, and Blofeld's cold and calculating demeanor makes him a formidable opponent. The use of vivid language, such as "the large bird crashed into the wall of glass" and "the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
