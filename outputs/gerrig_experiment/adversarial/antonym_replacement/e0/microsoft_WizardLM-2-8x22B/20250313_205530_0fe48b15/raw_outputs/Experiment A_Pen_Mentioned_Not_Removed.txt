1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Le Chiffre. His quick decision-making and physical prowess, as demonstrated in the passage, suggest that he is capable of creating opportunities for escape, even under challenging circumstances.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, as Bond is in a precarious situation with little control over his immediate future. The physical confrontation and Bond's attempt to communicate with Vesper add to the suspense, leaving the reader curious about Bond's next move and the potential outcomes of his capture. The narrative style of Ian Fleming also contributes to the suspense by providing vivid descriptions of the characters' actions and the dangerous environment they are in.
