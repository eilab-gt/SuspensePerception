1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has shown quick thinking and physical prowess suggests that he has a fair chance of escaping, especially if he can find an opportunity to use the environment to his advantage or if an ally intervenes.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is a prisoner and has just attempted an escape, which was thwarted. The physical confrontation, the presence of armed gunmen, and the unknown intentions of Le Chiffre all contribute to a high level of suspense. Readers are likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation
