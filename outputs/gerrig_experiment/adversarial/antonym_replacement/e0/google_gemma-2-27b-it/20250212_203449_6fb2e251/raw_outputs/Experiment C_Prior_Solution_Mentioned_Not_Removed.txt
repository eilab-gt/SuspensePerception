Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about Crushak being "devoted to eliminating such irritations" suggests a formidable opponent. However, this is a James Bond story, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape seemingly impossible situations.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond is captured, threatened, and physically restrained. Blofeld's calm demeanor and mention of the previous guard's demise add to the sense of danger. The introduction of the menacing Crushak further heightens the suspense.
