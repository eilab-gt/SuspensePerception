***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***  
**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful  

**Explanation:**  
1. Bond’s resourcefulness and quick thinking, such as his attempt to protect his fountain pen, suggest he has a plan or hidden tools that could aid in his escape. However, Le Chiffre’s vigilance and the presence of armed guards make the situation precarious, so escape is not guaranteed but remains a possibility.  
2. The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes confrontation, Bond’s desperate actions, and the tension created by Le Chiffre’s control over the situation. The uncertainty of Bond’s fate and the rapid pace of events heighten the suspense.
