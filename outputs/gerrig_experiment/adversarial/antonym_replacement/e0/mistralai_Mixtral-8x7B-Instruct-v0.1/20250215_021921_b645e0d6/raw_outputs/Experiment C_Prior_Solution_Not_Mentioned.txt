 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history and expertise as a secret agent, it is not unreasonable to assume that he may have a plan or some tricks up his sleeve to try and escape. With that said, it is still unclear how the situation will unfold and whether or not Bond will be successful in his escape attempts. Therefore, I would answer this question with option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond being held captive and facing an uncertain future. The power dynamic between Bond and Blofeld is also interesting, with Blofeld clearly holding the upper hand at the moment. Additionally, the introduction of a new character, Mr. Crushak, adds to the tension and uncertainty of the situation. Overall, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as a 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
