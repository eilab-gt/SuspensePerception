 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, with Blofeld and his two gunmen having the upper hand. However, given Bond's history of resourcefulness and ability to escape from tight spots, it is possible that he may still find a way to escape. Therefore, I would answer this question with option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond is at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and it is not clear how he will escape or what will happen to him next. This level of uncertainty and danger can contribute to a sense of suspense for the reader. Therefore, I would answer this question with option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
