 Question 1: Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Bond is currently in a difficult situation, he has already shown some resourcefulness in attempting to escape, and the text suggests that he has a history of being able to wriggle out of captivity. However, Blofeld's precautions and the presence of the formidable Mr. Crushak suggest that it will not be easy for Bond to escape.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author does an excellent job of building tension through the use of descriptive language and pacing. The stakes are high, and Bond's fate is uncertain, which adds to the suspense. The introduction of new characters and the revelation of Bond's history with Blofeld also contribute to the tension, as the reader is left wondering what will happen next.
