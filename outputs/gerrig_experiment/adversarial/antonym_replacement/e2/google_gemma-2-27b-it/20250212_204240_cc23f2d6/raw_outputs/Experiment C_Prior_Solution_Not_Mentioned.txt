Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the distraction to his advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld's introduction of Crushak and his menacing demeanor suggest that escape will be difficult.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's threatening tone. The description of Crushak's appearance and the painful restraint add to the tension. However, the passage doesn't end on a cliffhanger, which might make it less extremely suspenseful.
