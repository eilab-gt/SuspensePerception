Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld's introduction of Crushak, a seemingly ruthless and dedicated enforcer, makes a clean escape less likely. However, this is a James Bond story, and Bond's cunning and determination should not be underestimated.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling instructions create a palpable sense of danger. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and the threat of violence add to the suspense.
