1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. His quick thinking and physical prowess, as demonstrated by his attempt to follow Vesper and his agile recovery after being tripped, suggest that he has a fair chance of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a high-stakes confrontation between Bond and Le Chiffre, with Bond being disarmed and Vesper being taken away. The detailed description of the physical struggle and Bond's calculated movements to conceal his intentions create a tense atmosphere that keeps the reader engaged and wondering about the characters' fates.
