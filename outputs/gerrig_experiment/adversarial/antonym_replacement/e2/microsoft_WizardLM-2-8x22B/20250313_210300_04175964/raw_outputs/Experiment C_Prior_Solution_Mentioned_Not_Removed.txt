1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations and his ability to use distractions to his advantage, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches once again. However, the presence of a new, seemingly more competent guard, and the fact that Bond is bound with piano wire, suggests that his escape will not be easy and is not guaranteed.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a life-threatening situation for Bond, with immediate physical danger presented by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of a distraction, Bond's quick thinking, and the introduction of a new threat all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape.
