1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness, physical prowess, and history of escaping from difficult situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has some knowledge of his surroundings could aid in a future attempt.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation and Bond's quick thinking add to the suspense, as does the uncertainty of what will happen next. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape.
