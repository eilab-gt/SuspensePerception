1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's training and resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find an opportunity to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament. His quick thinking and physical prowess, as demonstrated by his attempt to follow Vesper and his agile recovery after being tripped, suggest that he is capable of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The detailed description of the physical confrontation, Bond's quick but unsuccessful attempt to resist, and the mention of a concealed item (the fountain pen) all contribute to a tense atmosphere that suggests further conflict and the potential for Bond to either escape or face severe consequences.
