Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past.  The passage hints at Bond's determination to escape ("Bond took advantage of the distraction...he hurried toward the door").  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond initially trying to escape, but then he's quickly thwarted. The introduction of Crushak and the graphic description of Bond being bound add to the sense of danger and uncertainty.
