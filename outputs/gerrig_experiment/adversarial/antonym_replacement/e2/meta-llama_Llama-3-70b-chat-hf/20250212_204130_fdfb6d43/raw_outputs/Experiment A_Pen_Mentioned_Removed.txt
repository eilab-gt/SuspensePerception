***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Bond being captured and disarmed, but it also hints at his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet (e.g., moving his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket). This leaves the reader uncertain about Bond's chances of escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and action, with Bond trying to escape and being thwarted by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of vivid language, such as "slammed himself back against the wall", "whistled past his hip", and "crashed to the ground", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape.
