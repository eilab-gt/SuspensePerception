The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld. He is currently bound and surrounded by Blofeld and his men, and Blofeld has made it clear that he intends to keep Bond captive. However, Bond has a history of outwitting his captors, so it is possible that he may find a way to escape.
