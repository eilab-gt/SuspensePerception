Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched for any remaining weapons. This doesn't look like a promising situation for Bond's escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Bond is trying to come up with a plan to escape. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistled past his hip", adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
