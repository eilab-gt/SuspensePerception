Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to evade Le Chiffre's gunmen and cause some damage to them, he is still a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Le Chiffre seems to be a cunning and resourceful adversary, and it may be difficult for Bond to escape from him.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Very suspenseful". Bond is in a dangerous situation, with Le Chiffre's gunmen closing in on him and Le Chiffre himself seeming to be enjoying the situation. The use of vivid language and the tense atmosphere create a sense of urgency and suspense, making it difficult to put the passage down.
