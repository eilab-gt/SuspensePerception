 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as moderately likely (option 5). Blofeld seems to underestimate Bond, providing an opportunity for Bond to potentially escape. However, Bond is physically restrained, which could make escaping more challenging.

Question 2: Considering the tension in the scene, the danger that Bond is in, and the uncertainty of the outcome, I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful (option 5). The author successfully conveys the urgency of the situation and the potential consequences for Bond, keeping the reader engaged and curious about what will happen next.
