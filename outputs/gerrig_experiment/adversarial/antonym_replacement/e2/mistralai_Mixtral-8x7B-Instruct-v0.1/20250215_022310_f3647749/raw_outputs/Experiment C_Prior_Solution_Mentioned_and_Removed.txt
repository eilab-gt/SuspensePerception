 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history and expertise as a secret agent, it is not unreasonable to assume that he may still have a chance to escape. Therefore, I would answer this question with option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond is trying to escape from Blofeld's clutches, only to be thwarted by Blofeld's henchman. This type of scenario is often used in thriller and adventure stories to build suspense and tension, and this passage is no exception. Therefore, I would answer this question with option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
