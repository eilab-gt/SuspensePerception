 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, with Blofeld and his two gunmen having the upper hand. However, given Bond's history of resourcefulness and ability to escape from tight spots, it is possible that he may still find a way to escape. Therefore, I would answer this question as "somewhat likely."

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond is at the mercy of his enemies and his escape seems uncertain. This type of scenario is often intended to create a sense of suspense and tension in the reader. Therefore, I would answer this question as "very suspenseful."
