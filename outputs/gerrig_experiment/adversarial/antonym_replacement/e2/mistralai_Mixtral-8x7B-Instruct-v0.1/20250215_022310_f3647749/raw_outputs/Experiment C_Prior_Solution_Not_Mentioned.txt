 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history and expertise as a secret agent, it is not unreasonable to assume that he may have a plan or some tricks up his sleeve to try and escape. With that said, it is still unclear how the situation will unfold and whether or not Bond will be successful in his escape attempts. Therefore, I would answer this question with option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond being held captive and facing the threat of violence from Blofeld and his gunmen. The unexpected distraction of the bird crashing into the window and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape adds to the suspense and uncertainty of the situation. Additionally, the fact that Bond is now being tied up and left in Blofeld's office with one of the gunmen suggests that the danger is not yet over. Therefore, I would answer this question with option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
