 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his men, and they have already disarmed him of his revolver. Although Bond is a skilled fighter, as shown by his attempt to kick the Corsican and escape, it will likely be challenging for him to escape from this situation without any weapons. Therefore, I would answer "2. Somewhat likely" for this question.

Question 2: Considering that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre, who has already caused him significant harm and intends to do more, I would say that this passage is "6. Very suspenseful." The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which adds to the suspense of the situation.
