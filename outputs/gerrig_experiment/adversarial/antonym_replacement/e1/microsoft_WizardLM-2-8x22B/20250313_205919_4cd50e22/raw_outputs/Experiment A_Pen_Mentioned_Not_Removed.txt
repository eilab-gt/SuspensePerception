1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's training and resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament. His quick thinking and physical prowess, as demonstrated by his attempt to follow Vesper and his agile recovery after being tripped, suggest that he has a fair chance of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is outnumbered and captured by the enemy. The detailed description of the physical confrontation, Bond's strategic thinking, and the looming threat of Le Chiffre and his gunmen create a sense of urgency and uncertainty about the outcome, which is characteristic of suspenseful storytelling.
