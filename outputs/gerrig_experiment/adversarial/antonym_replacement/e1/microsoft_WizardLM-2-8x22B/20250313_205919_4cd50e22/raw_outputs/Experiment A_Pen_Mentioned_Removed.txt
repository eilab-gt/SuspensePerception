1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's training and resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being captured and outnumbered, Bond's ability to cause distractions and his attempt to conceal his fountain pen (which could be a gadget) suggest that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is captured and at a disadvantage, yet there is an underlying sense of his potential to turn the tables. The detailed description of the physical confrontation and Bond's quick thinking adds to the tension, leaving the reader anticipating what Bond might do next to escape or what Le Chiffre's next move will be.
