1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations and his ability to use distractions to his advantage, it seems moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld once again. His previous success in outwitting a guard suggests that he has the skills and resourcefulness to attempt another escape.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful. It begins with a tense confrontation, includes an action sequence with Bond attempting to use a distraction to his advantage, and ends with Bond being captured and bound by a new, menacing adversary. The description of the situation, the characters, and the immediate danger Bond faces all contribute to a high level of suspense.
