1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being outnumbered and unarmed, Bond's training and quick thinking could potentially allow him to turn the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and violent confrontation, with Bond being ambushed and taken captive. The detailed description of the struggle, Bond's quick reactions, and the thorough search by Le Chiffre's henchmen all contribute to a tense atmosphere. The fact that Bond is now trapped and at the mercy of his enemies, coupled with Le Chiffre's taunting, creates a sense of urgency and danger that is typical of suspenseful scenes in the James Bond series.
