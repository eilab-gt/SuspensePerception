Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is clearly resourceful and skilled, he's currently disarmed and outnumbered. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and has already anticipated Bond's attempt to intervene.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's quick thinking and attempt to rescue Vesper create immediate danger. The descriptions of the physical struggle and Le Chiffre's watchful eye keep the reader on edge, wondering what will happen next.
