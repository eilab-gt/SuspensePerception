Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld and Crushak, given that they have him tied up in a chair and have taken away his freedom of movement.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense and creates a sense of unease.
