Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control, and Crushak appears to be a formidable opponent.  Escape doesn't seem impossible, given Bond's resourcefulness, but it's definitely an uphill battle.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, he's captured and restrained in a painful manner, and Blofeld's calm, menacing demeanor adds to the suspense. The introduction of Crushak as a brutal enforcer further heightens the sense of danger.
