1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1:** Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under close surveillance by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His initial attempt to escape was thwarted, and he has been stripped of his weapons. The situation appears dire, making escape seem "not very likely" at this moment.  
- **Question 2:** The passage is highly suspenseful due to Bond's desperate attempt to escape, the physical struggle, and the tension as Le Chiffre and his men methodically disarm and control him. The stakes are high, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.
