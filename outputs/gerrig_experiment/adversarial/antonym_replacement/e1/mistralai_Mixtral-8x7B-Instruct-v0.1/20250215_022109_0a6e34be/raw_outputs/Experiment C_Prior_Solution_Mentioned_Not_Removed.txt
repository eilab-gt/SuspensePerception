 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, with his escape looking uncertain at the moment. Blofeld and his large, ugly henchman, Crushak, appear to have the upper hand, and Bond is physically restrained. Therefore, I would answer "1. Not very likely" for Question 1.

Answer Question 2: As for Question 2, the passage does contain elements of suspense, as the reader is left wondering about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape from this predicament. However, without knowing the full context of the scene and what follows, it's difficult to judge the overall level of suspense. Based on the information provided in the passage alone, I would answer "5. Moderately suspenseful" for Question 2.
