 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond does show some resourcefulness and attempts to escape, so there is a possibility that he may still find a way to get out of this situation. Given the limited context, I would rate the likelihood as "somewhat likely" (option 2).

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Le Chiffre. There is a sense of uncertainty and danger, which can create suspense for the reader. However, the passage also provides some action and Bond's attempt to escape, which might release some of the tension. Considering these factors, I would rate the suspense level as "moderately suspenseful" (option 5).
