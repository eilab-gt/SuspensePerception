 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. Although Bond is a skilled fighter, it will be challenging for him to escape without any weapons while being guarded by two gunmen. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as: 2. Somewhat likely.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond's plan to do as much damage as possible and exchange words with Vesper adds to the tension. The fact that Bond is captured and disarmed also creates a sense of uncertainty and suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as: 6. Very suspenseful.
