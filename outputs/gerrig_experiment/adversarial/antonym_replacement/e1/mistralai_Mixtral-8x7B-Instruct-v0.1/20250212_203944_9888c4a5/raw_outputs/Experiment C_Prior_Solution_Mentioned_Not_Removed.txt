 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as moderately likely (option 5). Blofeld seems to have a pattern of underestimating Bond, which could provide an opportunity for Bond to escape. However, the immediate circumstances are challenging, with Bond being tied up and guarded by Crushak.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I find this passage to be very suspenseful (option 6). The author has created a tense atmosphere with Bond being captured, threatened, and physically restrained. The introduction of Crushak as a more formidable guard than the one in their previous encounter also adds to the suspense.
