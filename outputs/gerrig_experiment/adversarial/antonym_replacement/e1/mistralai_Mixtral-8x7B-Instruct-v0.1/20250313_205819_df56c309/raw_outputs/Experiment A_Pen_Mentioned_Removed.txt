 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently captured and outnumbered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond does show some resourcefulness in trying to escape and cause damage, but it's unclear if he has any more opportunities to do so. Therefore, I would answer "2. Somewhat likely" for now, but this could change depending on further information.

Answer Question 2: Considering the fact that James Bond, a well-known action hero, has been captured and is at the mercy of his enemy, I find this passage to be "6. Very suspenseful." The author does a good job of describing the immediate danger Bond is in, and the uncertainty of what will happen next keeps the reader on edge.
