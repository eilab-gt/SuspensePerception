 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Blofeld has clearly anticipated Bond's moves and has a formidable guard in Crushak, Bond has already demonstrated resourcefulness by attempting to escape earlier. However, the odds are still against him, given the constraints and the fact that he is now more thoroughly immobilized.

Question 2: Considering the dangerous situation Bond is in, the presence of a ruthless and powerful adversary, and Bond's own resilience, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The tension is heightened by Bond's previous encounters with Blofeld, the introduction of the intimidating Crushak, and Bond's current predicament, which leaves him at the mercy of his enemies.
