***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Bond being outsmarted and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from difficult situations.
