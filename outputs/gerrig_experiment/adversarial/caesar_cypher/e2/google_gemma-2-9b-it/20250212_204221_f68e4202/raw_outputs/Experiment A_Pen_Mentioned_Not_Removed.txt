Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He managed to initiate a fight and even concealed his pen, suggesting he's looking for opportunities.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is outnumbered and captured, but he's not giving up easily. The descriptions of the fight and Le Chiffre's watchful eye create a sense of urgency and danger.  We're left wondering if Bond can outsmart his captors and what Le Chiffre has planned for him.
