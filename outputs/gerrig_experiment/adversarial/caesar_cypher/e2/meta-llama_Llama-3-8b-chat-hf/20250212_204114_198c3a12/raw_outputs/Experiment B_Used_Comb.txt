Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught off guard and is now trapped, with no clear means of escape. He has been disarmed and his comb, which he was using to smooth his hair, has been taken away from him. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of tension and danger from the very beginning. The sudden burst of the door and the appearance of the gunmen creates a sense of shock and surprise, and Bond's attempts to defend himself are met with failure. The fact that Bond is trapped and disarmed, with no clear means of escape, adds to the sense of suspense and raises the stakes. The passage also creates a sense of intimacy and claustrophobia, as Bond is trapped in his hotel room with his captors, which adds to the overall sense of tension and suspense.
