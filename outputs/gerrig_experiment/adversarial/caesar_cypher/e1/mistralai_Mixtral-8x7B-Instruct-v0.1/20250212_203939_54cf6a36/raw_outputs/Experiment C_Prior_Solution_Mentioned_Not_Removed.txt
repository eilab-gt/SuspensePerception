 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's escape from Blofeld's captivity seems uncertain at this point. Bond attempted to escape when the bird crashed into the window, but he was quickly overpowered by Blofeld's large and ugly companion, Mr. Crushak. Blofeld then ordered Mr. Crushak to tie Bond up securely with piano wire. Given that Bond is now immobilized and under the watch of a formidable guard, it seems unlikely that Bond will easily escape from Blofeld. Therefore, the answer is:
4. Neutral or Uncertain

Question 2: The passage contains elements of suspense, such as Bond's attempt to escape and his subsequent capture, as well as the introduction of a new and intimidating character, Mr. Crushak. However, the level of suspense is not overwhelming, as the outcome of Bond's situation is not yet clear. Therefore, the answer is:
3. Slightly suspenseful
