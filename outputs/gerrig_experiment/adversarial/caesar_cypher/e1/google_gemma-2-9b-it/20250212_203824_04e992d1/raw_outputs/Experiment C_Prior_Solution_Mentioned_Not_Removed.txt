Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown to be resourceful and cunning.  The passage highlights his quick thinking in using the distraction to try and escape.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's initial attempt at escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and the painful restraint.  The threat to Bond's life and the mention of Blofeld's previous guard's demise create a sense of danger and uncertainty.
