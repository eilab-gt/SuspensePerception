Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled. He managed to briefly overpower one of the gunmen and displayed agility in avoiding the Corsican's attack.  However, he's now disarmed and outnumbered, making escape a significant challenge.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's quick thinking and action create a sense of urgency, while the descriptions of the gunmen's movements and Le Chiffre's watchful eye heighten the danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament.
