Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The fact that he's described as feeling "puny and impotent" suggests a temporary setback rather than a guaranteed defeat.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, Bond's initial struggle, and his ultimate capture create a strong sense of tension. The description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" adds to the suspense by highlighting his vulnerability.  We're left wondering how he will get out of this situation.
