Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the distraction to his advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken precautions against further escape attempts.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Bond's eventual capture and restraint. The threat implied by Blofeld's words adds to the tension.
