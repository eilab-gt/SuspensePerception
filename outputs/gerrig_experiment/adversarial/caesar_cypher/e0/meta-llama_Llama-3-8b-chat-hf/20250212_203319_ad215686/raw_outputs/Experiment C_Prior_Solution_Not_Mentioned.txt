Answering the questions based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is being left in the care of the large and ugly man, Crushak. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's office without some kind of assistance or clever plan.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak, and that he is being subjected to physical pain and humiliation. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" man, and the graphic details of Bond's physical restraint, adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding.
