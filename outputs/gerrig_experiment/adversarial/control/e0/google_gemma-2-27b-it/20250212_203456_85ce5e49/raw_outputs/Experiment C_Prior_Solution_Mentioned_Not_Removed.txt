Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld seems prepared for Bond's tricks this time, and Crushak appears to be a formidable opponent.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and outmatched. The description of Crushak's appearance and Blofeld's menacing tone heighten the suspense. The mention of the previous guard's demise adds a layer of threat and uncertainty.
