1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being outnumbered and unarmed, Bond's training and quick thinking could potentially allow him to turn the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and violent confrontation, with Bond being ambushed and taken captive. The detailed description of the fight, Bond's quick reactions, and the thorough search by Le Chiffre's henchmen create a tense atmosphere that suggests imminent danger and the potential for Bond to either ingeniously escape or face serious consequences.
