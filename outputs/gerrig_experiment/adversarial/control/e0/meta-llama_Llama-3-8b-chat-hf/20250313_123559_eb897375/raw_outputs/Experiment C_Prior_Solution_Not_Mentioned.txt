Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained by piano wire. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being restrained, and he is at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape.
