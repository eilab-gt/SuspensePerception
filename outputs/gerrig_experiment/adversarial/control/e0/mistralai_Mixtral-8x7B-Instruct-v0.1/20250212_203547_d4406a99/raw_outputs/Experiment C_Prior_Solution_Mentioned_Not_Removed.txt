 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Blofeld has clearly anticipated Bond's moves and has a formidable guard in Crushak, Bond has demonstrated resourcefulness and resilience in the past.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author has effectively built tension through the use of descriptive language, character interactions, and the imminent threat posed by Blofeld and Crushak. The uncertainty surrounding Bond's fate keeps the reader engaged and eager to discover what happens next.
