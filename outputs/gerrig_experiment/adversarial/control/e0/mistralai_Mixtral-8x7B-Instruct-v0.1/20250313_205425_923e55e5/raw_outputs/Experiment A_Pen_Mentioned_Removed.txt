 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has already shown some resourcefulness in trying to escape and reach Vesper. Considering Bond's skills and past experiences, it's reasonable to assume that he might still find a way to escape, even though it's not guaranteed. So, I would choose "Somewhat likely" for this question.

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being held captive and trying to escape. The detailed description of the Corsican gunman skillfully avoiding Bond's kick and Le Chiffre's quick action in disarming Bond adds to the tension. Therefore, I would choose "Very suspenseful" for this question.
