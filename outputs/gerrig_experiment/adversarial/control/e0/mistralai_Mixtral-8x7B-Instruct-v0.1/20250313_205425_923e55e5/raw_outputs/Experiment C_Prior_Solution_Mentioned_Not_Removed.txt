 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as moderately likely (option 5). Blofeld seems to underestimate Bond, providing an opportunity for Bond to take advantage of the distraction caused by the bird. However, Bond is quickly overpowered by Crushak and secured with piano wire. This demonstrates that while Bond is resourceful, he is also in a challenging situation with a formidable adversary.

Question 2: Considering the elements of surprise, the introduction of a new and menacing character (Crushak), and Bond's predicament, I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful (option 5). The tension is built through the power dynamic between Blofeld and Bond, as well as the uncertainty regarding Bond's fate.
