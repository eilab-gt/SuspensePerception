Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and disarmed, he displays his usual resourcefulness and agility.  The passage emphasizes Bond's pride in his ability to recover quickly from a fall, suggesting he won't go down easily.  However, he is outnumbered and at Le Chiffre's mercy, making a clean escape unlikely.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds suspense effectively. We see Bond's confidence turn to surprise and then vulnerability as he's ambushed. The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's menacing actions create a sense of danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
