1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has some knowledge of his surroundings could aid in his eventual escape.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the presence of armed guards all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape.
