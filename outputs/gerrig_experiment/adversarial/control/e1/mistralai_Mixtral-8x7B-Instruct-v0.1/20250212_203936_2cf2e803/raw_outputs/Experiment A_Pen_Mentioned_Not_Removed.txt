 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. Although Bond is a skilled fighter, it will be challenging for him to escape without any weapons while being guarded by two gunmen. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as: 2. Somewhat likely.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond is a well-known and beloved character, and the fact that he has been captured by the villain creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. The author also uses descriptive language to create a sense of urgency, such as "Like lightning" and "as if reading Bondâ€™s thoughts." Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as: 6. Very suspenseful.
