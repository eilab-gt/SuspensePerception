 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "somewhat likely" (2).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being captured and attempting to escape. Considering the danger and uncertainty presented in the excerpt, I would rate the suspense as "very suspenseful" (6).
