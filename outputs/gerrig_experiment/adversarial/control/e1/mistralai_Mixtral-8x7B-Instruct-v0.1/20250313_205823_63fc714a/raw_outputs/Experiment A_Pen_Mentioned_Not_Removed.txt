 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him of his revolver. Although Bond is a skilled fighter, as shown by his attempt to kick the Corsican and escape, it will likely be challenging for him to escape from multiple armed captors. Therefore, I would answer "2. Somewhat likely" for this question.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and is now at his mercy, and the danger and uncertainty that this situation presents, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "6. Very suspenseful".
