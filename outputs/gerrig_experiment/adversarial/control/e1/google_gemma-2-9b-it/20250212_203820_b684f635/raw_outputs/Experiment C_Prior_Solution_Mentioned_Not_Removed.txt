Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past.  The passage hints at Bond's potential for escape, even mentioning his previous success in outwitting Blofeld's guards.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond momentarily gain an advantage, only to be quickly thwarted. The introduction of the menacing Crushak and the graphic description of Bond's restraint heighten the sense of danger and uncertainty.
