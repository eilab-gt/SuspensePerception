Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld seems prepared for Bond's tricks this time, and Crushak appears to be a formidable opponent.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, and the introduction of the menacing Crushak raises the stakes. Blofeld's calm demeanor and veiled threats add to the suspense.
