1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Blofeld. Despite being captured and bound, Bond's resourcefulness and experience in such scenarios suggest that he may find a way to overcome the odds.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense confrontation between Bond and Blofeld, with Bond using a distraction to attempt an escape, only to be thwarted by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The description of the tightening piano wire adds to the suspense by highlighting the physical discomfort and the increasing stakes of Bond's predicament. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this seemingly dire situation.
