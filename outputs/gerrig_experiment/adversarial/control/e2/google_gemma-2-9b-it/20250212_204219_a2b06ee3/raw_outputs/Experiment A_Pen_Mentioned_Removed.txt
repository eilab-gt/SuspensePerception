Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is clearly resourceful and skilled, he's currently disarmed and outnumbered. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and has already anticipated Bond's attempt to intervene.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond's attempt to help Vesper is thwarted, he's captured, and his weapons are taken.  Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and the description of the gunmen's actions add to the feeling that Bond is in a precarious situation.
