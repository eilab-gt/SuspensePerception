Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled. He managed to briefly overpower one of the gunmen and displayed agility in avoiding the Corsican's attack.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is outnumbered and outgunned, but he's trying to act quickly and protect Vesper. The descriptions of the physical struggle and Le Chiffre's calm, calculating demeanor create a sense of impending danger.
