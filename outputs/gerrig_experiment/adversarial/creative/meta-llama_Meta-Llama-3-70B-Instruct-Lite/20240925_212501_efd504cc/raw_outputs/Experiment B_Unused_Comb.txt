It seems you provided a different passage than the original one. However, I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Since the passage doesn't mention Bond or Le Chiffre, I'll answer based on the situation described in the passage. It seems Riley is in a difficult situation, and it's not clear how he'll escape. Therefore, I'll choose:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage is quite suspenseful, as Riley is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he'll get out of it. The use of words like "burst", "guns drawn", and "trapped" adds to the tension. I'll choose:

6. Very suspenseful
