It seems like there's been a mistake. The provided passage is not from Ian Fleming's novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", but rather a different story altogether. The passage provided is a scene with characters Jordan, Drew, and Cameron, and has no connection to James Bond or Blofeld.

If I were to answer the questions based on this passage, I would say:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Drew will escape from Jordan and Cameron?"***
I would answer: 3. Slightly likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful
