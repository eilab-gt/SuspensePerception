I apologize, but the provided text does not match the original passage mentioned. The original passage was supposed to be from Ian Fleming's tenth James Bond novel, 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', but the provided text appears to be from a different story.

However, if I were to answer the questions based on the provided text, here are my responses:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Not applicable, as the provided text does not mention Bond or Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would rate it a 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates tension by describing a character, Riley, being held captive and threatened by another character, and the use of descriptive language like "very large and very ugly man" and "piano wire bit more painfully into Riley's flesh" adds to the sense of danger and unease. However, the passage is more focused on setting the scene and establishing the characters' situations rather than building towards a climactic moment, which prevents it from being extremely suspenseful.
