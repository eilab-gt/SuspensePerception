It seems like there's been a mistake. The passage provided doesn't match the original description. The passage provided appears to be a different story, not an excerpt from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Since there's no Bond or Blofeld in the provided passage, I'll have to skip this question.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I'd rate the suspense level as 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Alex being trapped and threatened by the ugly man, Jamie. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly man" and "contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. However, the passage is relatively short, and the situation, while intense, is not extremely complex, which prevents it from being extremely suspenseful.
