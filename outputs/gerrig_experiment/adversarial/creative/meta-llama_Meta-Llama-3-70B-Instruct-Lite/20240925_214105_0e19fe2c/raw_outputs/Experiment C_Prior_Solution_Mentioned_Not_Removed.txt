I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional passage that was added later.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to suggest that Bond's escape is likely or unlikely. It only sets the stage for a potentially precarious situation for Bond.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension by placing Bond and Vesper in a dangerous situation as prisoners of Blofeld, but it doesn't reveal the full extent of the danger or create an imminent sense of threat. The suspense is moderate, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next.
