I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and it's unlikely that the author would let him be captured without a plan for escape. Although the situation seems dire, Bond has already shown his ability to think on his feet and take advantage of distractions.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of descriptive language, such as the painful twisting of the wire into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of danger and urgency. The sudden distractions, like the bird crashing into the wall, and Bond's quick thinking, keep the reader on edge, wondering what will happen next.
