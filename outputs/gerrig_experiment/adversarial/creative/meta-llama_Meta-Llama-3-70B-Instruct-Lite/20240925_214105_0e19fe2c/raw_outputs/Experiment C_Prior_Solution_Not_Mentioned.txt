I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the original description. The original description mentioned that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, but the provided passage does not mention Vesper at all. It seems to be a different scene from the book.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage does not provide enough information to determine how likely it is for Bond to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere with Bond being tied up and threatened by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The sudden interruption by the bird crashing into the glass wall adds to the sense of uncertainty and suspense.
