I apologize, but the provided passage is not the same as the initial passage. The initial passage only provided context, and the new passage appears to be a scene from the book. 

However, based on the new passage, I'll do my best to answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently in a difficult situation, the passage shows him actively trying to create opportunities to escape and communicate with Vesper. His actions suggest that he is resourceful and determined to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is filled with action, violence, and tension. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage," adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
