Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond is a skilled agent, he is currently in a precarious situation, and it's not clear how he will manage to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond trying to escape and being thwarted by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of vivid language and sudden events (e.g., the Corsican's quick shot and Bond's crash to the ground) adds to the sense of suspense and drama.
