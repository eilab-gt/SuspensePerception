I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional text.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape, but it does set up a precarious situation for Bond, which could go either way.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension by revealing that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, which raises questions about their fate and creates a sense of danger and uncertainty.
