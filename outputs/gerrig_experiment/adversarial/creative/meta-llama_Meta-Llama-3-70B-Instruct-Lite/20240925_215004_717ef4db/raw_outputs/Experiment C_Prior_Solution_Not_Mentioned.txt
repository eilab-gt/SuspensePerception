***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide a clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond has been resourceful and quick-thinking in the past, he is currently in a precarious situation, tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The outcome is uncertain, and it's hard to predict whether Bond will manage to escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering if he will escape or if Blofeld will succeed in eliminating him. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the "painfully" tight piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and tension. The passage effectively creates a sense of suspense, leaving the reader eager to find out what happens next.
