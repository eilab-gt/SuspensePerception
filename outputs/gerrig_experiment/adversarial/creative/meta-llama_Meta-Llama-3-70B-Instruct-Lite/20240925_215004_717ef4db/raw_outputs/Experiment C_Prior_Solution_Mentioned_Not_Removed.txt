I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 3. Slightly likely

Although Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, he was quickly caught by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, and tied up. The situation looks dire for Bond, and it's uncertain how he will manage to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond trying to escape and Blofeld's henchman hot on his heels. The description of the scene, including the bird crashing into the wall and the darkening of the room, adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is tied up and at the mercy of Crushak raises the stakes and creates a sense of suspense.
