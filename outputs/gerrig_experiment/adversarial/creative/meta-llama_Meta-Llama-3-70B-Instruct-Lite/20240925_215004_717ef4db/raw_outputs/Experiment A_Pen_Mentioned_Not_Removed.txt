I'll answer the questions based on the passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 3. Slightly likely. Although Bond is in a precarious situation, he is a resourceful character, and the passage hints at his attempts to plan and act quickly to gain an advantage. However, the situation is dire, and it's uncertain how he will escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond in a dangerous situation and trying to think on his feet to escape. The use of vivid language, such as "hurled himself down the passage", "slammed himself back against the wall", and "crashed to the ground", adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation, making the passage very suspenseful.
