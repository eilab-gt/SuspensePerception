I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide clear hints about Bond's chances of escape, but it does show Bond's resourcefulness and agility in the face of danger, which might suggest that he still has a chance to escape. However, the situation seems dire, with Bond being trapped and disarmed.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action, tension, and unexpected turns of events. The sudden invasion of Bond's room, the fight, and the subsequent capture and search of Bond all contribute to a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next, which creates suspense.
