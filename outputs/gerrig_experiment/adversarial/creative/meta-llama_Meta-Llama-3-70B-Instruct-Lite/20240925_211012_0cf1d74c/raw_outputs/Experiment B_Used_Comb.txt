I apologize, but it seems that the provided passage is not an excerpt from Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, 'Casino Royale'. The passage appears to be a different story with characters named Jordan, Alex, and Vesper, but not James Bond. 

To answer the questions, I'll assume the passage is the correct one. If that's not the case, please provide the correct passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Alex?"***
Since the passage doesn't provide a clear indication of Jordan's escape or rescue, I'll choose:
4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage builds up the tension and suspense with the sudden invasion, Jordan's attempt to resist, and his eventual capture. The dialogue and the actions of the characters contribute to the suspense. I'll choose:
6. Very suspenseful
