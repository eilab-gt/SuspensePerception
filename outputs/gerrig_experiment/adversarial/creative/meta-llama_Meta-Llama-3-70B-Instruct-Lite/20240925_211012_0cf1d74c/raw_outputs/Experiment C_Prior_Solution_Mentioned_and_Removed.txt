It seems you provided a different passage, not the one mentioned in the original text. The original passage was about James Bond, while the new passage appears to be about a character named Riley and Alex. I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the new passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from Alex?"***
I would answer: 3. Slightly likely. The passage sets up a situation where Riley is tied up and guarded by Alex, making escape seem difficult. However, the mention of Riley's previous escape from Alex's guard in the past suggests that Riley might have some skills or resources that could aid in another escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates tension by describing the physical confrontation between Riley and Alex, the use of guns, and the violent tone of the scene. The description of Riley being tied up and threatened adds to the sense of danger and suspense. The passage effectively builds a sense of unease and uncertainty about Riley's fate.
