I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the description of being an excerpt from Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, 'Casino Royale'. The passage appears to be a different story altogether, with a character named Jordan instead of James Bond.

However, I can still attempt to answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from the situation?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage does not give a clear indication of Jordan's chances of escape, and it seems that he is currently at a disadvantage.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage has some tense moments, such as the sudden burst of gunmen into the room and Jordan's attempts to defend himself. However, the tone of the passage is somewhat lighthearted and humorous, which reduces the overall suspense.
