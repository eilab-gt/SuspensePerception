It seems that the provided passage is not from Ian Fleming's novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" but rather an unrelated passage. However, I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Since the passage doesn't provide any information about Bond's situation, I'll have to answer based on general knowledge of James Bond's character. Given Bond's reputation for escaping from difficult situations, I'd say:

6. Very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Since the provided passage is not from the mentioned novel, I'll evaluate the suspense level of the given passage instead. The passage has a clear sense of tension and danger, with a character being tied up and threatened. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful wire twisting into the flesh, adds to the suspense. I'd rate it:

6. Very suspenseful
