It seems like you've provided a different passage than the one mentioned in the original prompt. The passage you provided appears to be a different story with characters named Alex, Jordan, and Mr. Jordan, whereas the original passage was about James Bond, Blofeld, and Vesper.

To answer the questions based on the original passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled spy and has a reputation for escaping from difficult situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage sets up a situation where Bond and Vesper are in danger, but it doesn't have a lot of action or intense descriptions to create high suspense. However, it does create some tension and anticipation for what might happen next.
