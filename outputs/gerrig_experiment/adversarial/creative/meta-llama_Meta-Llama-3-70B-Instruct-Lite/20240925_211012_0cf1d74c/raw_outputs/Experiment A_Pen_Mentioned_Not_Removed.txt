I apologize, but the provided passage is not the same as the initial description. The initial description was a brief summary of the plot, while the provided passage is an actual excerpt from the book. 

However, I can still answer the questions based on the initial description.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful secret agent, and it's likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre's trap.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The initial description sets up a tense and dangerous situation, with Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. This creates a sense of suspense and raises questions about how Bond will escape, which keeps the reader engaged and interested.
