I apologize, but the provided passage is not related to the James Bond novel 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' and seems to be an unrelated story. The passage you provided doesn't mention Bond, Blofeld, or Vesper at all. 

If you could provide the correct passage, I'd be happy to help you answer the questions.
