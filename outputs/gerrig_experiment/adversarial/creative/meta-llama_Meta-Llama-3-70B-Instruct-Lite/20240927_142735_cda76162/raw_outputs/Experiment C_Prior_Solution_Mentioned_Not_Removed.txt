It seems like there's been a mistake. The provided text is not related to the James Bond novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" by Ian Fleming. It appears to be a completely different story.

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the provided passage, even though it's not the correct text.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Morgan?"***

I'll answer this question since the passage is about Jordan being captured by Morgan. Based on the passage, it seems like Morgan has taken precautions to ensure Jordan is securely tied up, and Crushak is responsible for watching him. Given this, I would say:

5. Moderately likely

Jordan might still find a way to escape, but it seems like Morgan has taken steps to prevent it.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage does create some tension, especially when Jordan tries to escape and Morgan's plan is revealed. The use of words like "contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile" adds to the ominous tone. However, the passage is quite short, and the events unfold relatively quickly. I would say:

5. Moder
