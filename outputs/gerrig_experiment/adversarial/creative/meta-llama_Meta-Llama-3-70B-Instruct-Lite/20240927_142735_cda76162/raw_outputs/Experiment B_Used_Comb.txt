I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional passage provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a dire situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, so it's hard to predict the likelihood of his escape without more context.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage effectively conveys a sense of danger and tension, with Bond and Vesper being trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The situation is ominous and foreboding, creating suspense and making the reader wonder what will happen next.
