I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the original description. The passage appears to be about a character named Jordan, not James Bond. It seems to be a different story altogether.

To answer the questions, I would need the correct passage from Ian Fleming's "Casino Royale". If you could provide the correct passage, I'd be happy to assist you.
