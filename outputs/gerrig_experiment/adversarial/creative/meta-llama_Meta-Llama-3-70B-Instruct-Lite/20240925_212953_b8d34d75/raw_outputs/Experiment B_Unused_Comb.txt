I think there may be a mistake here! The passage provided doesn't seem to match the description of an excerpt from Ian Fleming's "Casino Royale" about James Bond. The passage appears to be about someone named Riley instead.

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from the gunmen?"***
I'll choose answer 3. Slightly likely. The passage shows Riley as a resourceful person who can take care of himself, but he's currently trapped and outnumbered.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I'll choose answer 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates tension with the sudden invasion by the gunmen and Riley's subsequent struggles, but the tone is somewhat lightened by the description of Riley's pride in his agility and the gunmen's rough but almost playful treatment of him.
