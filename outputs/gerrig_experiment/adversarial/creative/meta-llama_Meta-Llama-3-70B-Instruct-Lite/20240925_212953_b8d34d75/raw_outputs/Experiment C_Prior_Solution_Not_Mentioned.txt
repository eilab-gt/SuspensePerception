I apologize, but the passage provided is not the correct excerpt from Ian Fleming's novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". The passage appears to be from a different story or novel.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that the protagonist (Drew) will escape from Jordan and Cameron?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide clear information about Drew's chances of escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates tension and suspense through the sudden appearance of the bird, the struggle between Drew and Jordan, and the threatening presence of Cameron. The use of descriptive language, such as the contorted face of Cameron, adds to the sense of unease and suspense.
