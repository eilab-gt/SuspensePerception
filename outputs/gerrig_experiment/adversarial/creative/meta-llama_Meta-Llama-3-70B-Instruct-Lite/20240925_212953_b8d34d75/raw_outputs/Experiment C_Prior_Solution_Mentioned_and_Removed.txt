It seems like there's been a mistake. The provided passage doesn't match the description of the excerpt from Ian Fleming's tenth James Bond novel, 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. The passage provided appears to be from a different story altogether.

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Since the passage doesn't mention Bond or Blofeld, I'll have to answer based on the context of the passage provided. In this case, it seems Alex is the captive, and the passage doesn't give much hope for his escape. So, I'll answer:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage has a sense of tension and danger, with Alex being held captive and threatened. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly man" and "piano wire bit more painfully into Alex's flesh", adds to the suspense. I'd rate the suspense level as:

6. Very suspenseful
