It seems that the provided passage is not from Ian Fleming's novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" but rather a different story. However, I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Since the passage doesn't mention Bond, Blofeld, or any relevant information, I'll have to answer based on general knowledge of James Bond stories. In that case, I'd say:
6. Very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the provided passage, I'd say:
6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Riley being captured and tied up by Jordan, and the threat of elimination hanging over him. The atmosphere is dark and menacing, making it a suspenseful passage.
