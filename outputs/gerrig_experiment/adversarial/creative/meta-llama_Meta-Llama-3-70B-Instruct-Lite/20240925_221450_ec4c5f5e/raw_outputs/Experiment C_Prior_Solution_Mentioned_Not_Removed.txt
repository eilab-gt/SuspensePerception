It seems like you provided a different passage than the one mentioned in the original prompt. The passage you provided appears to be from a different story altogether. 

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the passage you provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Morgan?"***
I'll choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't give a clear indication of whether Jordan will escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I'll choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is quite intense, with a sense of danger and captivity, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Jordan next.
