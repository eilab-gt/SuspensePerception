I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 3. Slightly likely

Although Bond is a skilled agent, the passage describes him as feeling "puny and impotent" and being overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. However, Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, and it's possible he might find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful, as Bond is suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by Le Chiffre's men, and the description of the scene creates a sense of urgency and danger. The use of active verbs and vivid imagery ("the door burst in", "whirled around", "caught one of the gunmen squarely in the stomach") adds to the tension and suspense.
