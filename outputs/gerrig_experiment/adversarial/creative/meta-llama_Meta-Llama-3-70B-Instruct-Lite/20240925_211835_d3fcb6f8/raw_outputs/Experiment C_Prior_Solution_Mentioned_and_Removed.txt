I apologize, but it seems you provided a different passage than the original one. The original passage was about James Bond, while the provided passage is about a character named Alex.

If I were to answer the questions based on the new passage, here are my responses:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from his captors?"***
I would choose option 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Alex's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Alex being captured and threatened, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
