I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would choose: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and the passage shows him trying to make a plan to escape and even attempting to take down the gunmen. Although he is currently a prisoner, his abilities and resourcefulness suggest that he might be able to find a way out.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond being held captive and trying to come up with an escape plan. The use of action words like "slammed," "twisted," and "barked" adds to the sense of intensity, and the reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape and what will happen to him and Vesper.
