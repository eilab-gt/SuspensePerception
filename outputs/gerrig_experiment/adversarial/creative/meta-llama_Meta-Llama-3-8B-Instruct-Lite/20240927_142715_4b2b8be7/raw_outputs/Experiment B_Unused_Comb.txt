Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage implies that Bond is in a precarious situation, being surrounded by three large men with guns drawn, and being searched and disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful due to the sudden and unexpected turn of events, where Bond is caught off guard by the gunmen and is forced to use his agility and quick thinking to defend himself. The use of descriptive language, such as "the door burst in towards him", "the largest of the men was Alex, Bond's recently vanquished opponent", and "Bond felt puny and impotent" adds to the sense of tension and drama, making the passage highly suspenseful.
