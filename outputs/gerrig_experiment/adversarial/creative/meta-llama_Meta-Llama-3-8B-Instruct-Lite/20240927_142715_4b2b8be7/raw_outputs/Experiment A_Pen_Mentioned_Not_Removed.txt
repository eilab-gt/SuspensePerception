To answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer 1. Not very likely. Bond has been trapped by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it seems that he is at a disadvantage. He is being searched and disarmed, which doesn't bode well for his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is being captured and searched, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of descriptive language, such as "agilely" and "unquiet", adds to the suspense, and the fact that Bond is being disarmed and searched makes it seem like a precarious situation.
