Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a dire situation, surrounded by Le Chiffre's henchmen, with his gun and pen taken away. This implies that his chances of escape are slim, making option 1, "Not very likely", the most suitable answer.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond's situation becoming increasingly dire as he's disarmed and led away. The use of words like "crashed", "rolled", "agilely", and "brusquely" adds to the sense of action and urgency, making it a very suspenseful passage. The fact that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors, with little chance of escape, heightens the sense of tension, making this passage extremely suspenseful.
