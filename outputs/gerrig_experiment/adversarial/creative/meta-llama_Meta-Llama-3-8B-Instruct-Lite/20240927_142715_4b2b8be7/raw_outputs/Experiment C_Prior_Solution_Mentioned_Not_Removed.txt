To answer the questions based on the provided passage from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service':

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

This is because Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which makes it difficult for Bond to escape. Additionally, the passage does not suggest that Bond has a plan to escape or that he has any clear opportunities to do so, making it seem unlikely that he will escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to them. The description of their predicament is vivid and unsettling, and the tone of the passage is ominous, which adds to the suspense. The use of words like "prisoners" and "gunmen" also creates a sense of foreboding, making the passage very suspenseful.
