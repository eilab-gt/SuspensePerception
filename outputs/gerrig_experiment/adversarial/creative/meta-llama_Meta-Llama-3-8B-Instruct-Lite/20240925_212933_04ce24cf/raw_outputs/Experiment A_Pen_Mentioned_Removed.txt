Answering the questions based on the passage:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently the prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he is being searched for any other weapons. It seems like a difficult situation for Bond to escape from, especially given the superior numbers and arms of his captors.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, with Bond being overpowered by Le Chiffre's henchmen, and his attempts to fight back being foiled. The use of vivid and active language, such as "crash to the ground", "whistled past his hip", and "shot out his left hand", creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like they are experiencing the action firsthand. The cliffhanger ending, with Alex taking away Bond's fountain pen, also adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
