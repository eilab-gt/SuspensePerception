Answering the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 1. Not very likely. Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his henchmen, and it seems unlikely that he will escape at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and action, with Bond being caught by the bad guys, and there's a sense of danger and uncertainty about what will happen to him. The rapid-fire succession of events, the vivid descriptions of the characters' actions, and the use of action verbs like "whistled", "crashed", and "twisted" all contribute to a sense of suspense and tension.
