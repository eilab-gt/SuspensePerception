Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it's unlikely that Bond will escape from their clutches, especially since he's already in a precarious situation.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and tension. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and there's a high stakes situation unfolding. The use of action-packed descriptions, such as "gadgets drawn", "pulled out of its shoulder holster", and "twisted sharply" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The passage also sets up a sense of uncertainty, making the reader wonder how Bond and Vesper will escape or if they'll be able to overcome their predicament.
