Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre's trap and is now a prisoner, making it not very likely that he will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is being pursued by the Corsican and Jordan, and he is struggling to escape and protect himself. The descriptive language used, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion in which he took great pride, he righted himself with minimal damage", adds to the sense of action and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape.
