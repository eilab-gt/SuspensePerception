Answer 1: 1. Not very likely
It is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is trapped in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapping around his arms and is being guarded by two gunmen, Crushak and the large and ugly man.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful
This passage is very suspenseful due to the tense and confined setting, the presence of the villainous Blofeld, and the danger posed to Bond and Vesper. The use of descriptive language, such as "large bird", "crash", "painfully into Bond's flesh", and "ugly man", adds to the sense of tension and unease, making it a highly suspenseful passage.
