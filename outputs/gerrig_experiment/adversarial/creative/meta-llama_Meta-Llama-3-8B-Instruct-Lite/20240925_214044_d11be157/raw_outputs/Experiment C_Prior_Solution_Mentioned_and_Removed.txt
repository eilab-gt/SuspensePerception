Answer 1: I would choose 1. Not very likely. The passage describes Bond as being trapped by Blofeld and his two gunmen, with no clear indication of how he might escape. Blofeld has outsmarted Bond and taken him captive, making escape seem unlikely.

Answer 2: I would choose 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and ominous descriptions, such as Bond being "pinned in place" by piano wire, being threatened with guns, and facing a large and ugly man. The story is unfolding in a dark and intense environment, with danger lurking around every corner, making it a very suspenseful passage. The twists and turns in the story, such as the sudden arrival of the large man, add to the sense of tension and suspense.
