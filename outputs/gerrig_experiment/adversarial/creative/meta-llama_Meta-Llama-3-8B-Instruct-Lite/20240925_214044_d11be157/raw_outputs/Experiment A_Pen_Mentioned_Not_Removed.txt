Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and is not in a good position to escape. He is being searched and disarmed, and is being dragged away from Vesper, which suggests that his chances of escape are slim.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is highly suspenseful, as Bond is in a dire situation and is being forced to rely on his wits and cunning to escape. The use of phrases such as "the two gunmen dragged Bond to his feet", "Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket" and "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins and brought a whistle of pain from him" creates a sense of tension and urgency, making the reader feel like they are on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next. The use of descriptive language and vivid imagery also adds to the suspense, painting a vivid picture of the scene and making it easy to imagine the action unfolding.
