Answering the questions based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. His ability to move his fountain pen to a safer location in his breast pocket suggests that he is trying to plan a potential escape, but the passage does not indicate that he has a clear path to freedom.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is building tension and suspense as Bond is captured and disarmed, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper. The use of words like "whistled", "pain", and "quiet chest" creates a sense of drama and danger, making the passage highly suspenseful. The rapid-fire series of events, including Bond's kick, his attempt to take down the gunmen, and Le Chiffre's reaction, keeps the reader engaged and on edge.
