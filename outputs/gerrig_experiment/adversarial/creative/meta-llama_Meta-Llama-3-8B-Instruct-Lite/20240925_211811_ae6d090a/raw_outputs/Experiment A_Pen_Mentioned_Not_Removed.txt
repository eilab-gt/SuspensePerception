Answer 1: **1. Not very likely**
The passage suggests that Bond is captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it doesn't provide any clear hints of how Bond might escape. This makes it less likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Answer 2: **6. Very suspenseful**
The passage is extremely suspenseful, as it sets up a tense and precarious situation for Bond and Vesper, with Bond facing capture and possibly even danger. The rapid sequence of events, the use of action-packed language, and the dramatic tone all contribute to a sense of heightened tension and suspense.
