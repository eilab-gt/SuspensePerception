Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it is not clear how he will escape. He has tried to fight back, but has been outnumbered and outmaneuvered. It seems unlikely that he will escape from this situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is in danger of being captured and possibly harmed. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape and what will happen to him and Vesper. The use of action and violence, as well as the clear danger that Bond is in, creates a sense of tension and suspense.
