Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Taylor (who is later revealed to be Bond) is caught off guard by the sudden and violent intrusion of the gunmen, and is subjected to a humiliating and helpless search. The use of words like "busted in", "guns drawn", "searched", and "impotent" contributes to the overall sense of suspense and danger. The passage creates a sense of urgency and tension, making it very suspenseful.
