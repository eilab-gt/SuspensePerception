To answer Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which suggests that they are in a vulnerable position and may not be able to escape easily. Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for them, which further reduces the likelihood of a successful escape.
