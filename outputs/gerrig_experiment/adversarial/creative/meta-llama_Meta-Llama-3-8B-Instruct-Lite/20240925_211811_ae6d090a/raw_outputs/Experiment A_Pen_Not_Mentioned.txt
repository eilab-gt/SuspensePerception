Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The situation is grim for Bond. He has been captured by Le Chiffre and his henchmen, and he is being searched and disarmed. He is at a disadvantage, and it seems unlikely that he will escape on his own.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful. The sudden twist in the action, the use of words like "lightning" and "agilely" to describe the characters' movements, and the sense of danger and violence create a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be overpowered by his captors.
