To answer Question 1:

I would choose option 1. "Not very likely" as it is unlikely that Bond, given his situation of being a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, will escape successfully.

To answer Question 2:

I would choose option 7. "Extremely suspenseful" as the passage presents a sense of danger, tension, and uncertainty, making it a thrilling and suspenseful scene. The unexpected twists, the dark setting, and the menacing presence of Blofeld and his henchmen all contribute to a sense of suspense that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
