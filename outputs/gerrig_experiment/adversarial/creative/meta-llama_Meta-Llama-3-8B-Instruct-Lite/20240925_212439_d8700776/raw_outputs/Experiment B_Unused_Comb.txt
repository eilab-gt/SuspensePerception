Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond and Vesper as being "now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen," which suggests that they are in a precarious situation and may have limited options for escape. The tone of the passage also implies that they are in a vulnerable and potentially dangerous situation, which further supports the answer "Not very likely".

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the use of words like "prisoners", "gunmen", and "trap". The description of Bond and Vesper being trapped and helpless, as well as the ominous tone of the passage, creates a sense of foreboding and uncertainty, making it extremely suspenseful.
