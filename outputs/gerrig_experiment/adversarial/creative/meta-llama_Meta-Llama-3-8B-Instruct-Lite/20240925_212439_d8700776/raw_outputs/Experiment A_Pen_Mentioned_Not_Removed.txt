Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and he is at a disadvantage. He is outnumbered and outgunned, and it will likely take a clever and resourceful plan to escape.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper. The use of phrases such as "crashed to the ground", "agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed", and "his unquiet chest" adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
