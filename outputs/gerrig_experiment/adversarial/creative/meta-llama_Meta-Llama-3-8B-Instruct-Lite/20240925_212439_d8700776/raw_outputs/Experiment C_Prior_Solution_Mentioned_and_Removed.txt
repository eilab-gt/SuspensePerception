Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Based on the passage, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, as he is currently the prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen. Bond's situation appears to be precarious, and there is no indication that he has a plan or a clear opportunity to escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is highly suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and danger for the characters. The use of action, violence, and intimidation techniques by Blofeld's henchmen creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Bond's situation. The dark and ominous tone of the passage, as well as the threat of violence and death, contribute to its suspenseful atmosphere.
