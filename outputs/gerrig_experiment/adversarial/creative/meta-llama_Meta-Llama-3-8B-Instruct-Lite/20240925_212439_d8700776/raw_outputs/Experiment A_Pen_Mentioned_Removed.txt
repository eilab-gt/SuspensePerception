Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, Alex and the Corsican. He has tried to fight back, but was quickly overpowered and disarmed. Given his current situation, it seems unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it describes a intense and potentially violent situation where the protagonist, Bond, is being held captive and is trying to escape. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "twisted sharply", and "his plan was to do as much damage as possible" creates a sense of tension and urgency, making the reader feel like something bad could happen at any moment. The fact that Bond is being stripped of his weapons and is being kept under close guard adds to the sense of unease and raises questions about what will happen to him next. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
