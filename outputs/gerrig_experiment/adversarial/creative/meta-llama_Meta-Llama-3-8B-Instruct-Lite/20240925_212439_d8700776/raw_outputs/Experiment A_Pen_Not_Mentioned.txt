**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a difficult situation, surrounded by Le Chiffre's gunmen and being searched for other weaponry. It's likely that Bond will face a tough time trying to escape, especially given the odds.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond finds himself in a precarious situation. The use of phrases like "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins and brought a whistle of pain from him" and "the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond's foot whistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond's shoe at the top of its arc, and twisted it sharply" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape or if he will be caught by Le Chiffre's henchmen, making it a very suspenseful passage.
