To answer the questions:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**
I would answer: 1. Not very likely
Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, making it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own. He would likely need a dramatic turn of events or clever plan to escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful
The passage is quite suspenseful because it sets up a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of action and violence, such as the crash of the bird into the glass wall, adds to the suspense, making the reader feel like something dramatic is about to unfold. The fact that Bond is helpless and trapped makes the situation even more suspenseful.
