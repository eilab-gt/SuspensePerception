Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been captured and is now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, making it unlikely that he will escape without some kind of clever maneuver or rescue.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and stripped of his gun and pen, leaving him disarmed and at the mercy of his captors. The use of phrases like "crashed to the ground", "the thin man kept his gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest", and "Let's not waste time" also adds to the suspense and sense of urgency. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and how he will escape from this precarious situation.
