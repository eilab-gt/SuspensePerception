Answer 1: 1. Not very likely
Bond has been caught off guard and disarmed, and he's now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. This makes it seem unlikely that he'll be able to escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful
The passage is filled with elements of suspense, including the sudden and unexpected attack by the henchmen, Bond's inability to defend himself, and the overall sense of danger and uncertainty. The use of words like "burst in," "guns drawn," and "patted him down" adds to the sense of tension and raises the stakes for Bond's situation.
