Based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and the situation seems to be unfavorable for their escape. Blofeld has successfully trapped them, which suggests that their chances of escape are low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense due to the sudden and unexpected turn of events, where Bond and Vesper find themselves trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The use of vivid descriptions and the building sense of danger and uncertainty make the passage highly suspenseful.
