Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been caught off guard and outnumbered by Le Chiffre's henchmen, including his former opponent Alex. He is unable to resist and is forced to submit to a search and disarming. This indicates that his escape is unlikely at this point.

Answer to Question 2:
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful as it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden and unexpected entry of the gunmen, Bond's struggles to defend himself, and his ultimate defeat all contribute to a high level of suspense. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "guns drawn", "barked", "twisted it sharply", and "crashed to the ground", also adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
