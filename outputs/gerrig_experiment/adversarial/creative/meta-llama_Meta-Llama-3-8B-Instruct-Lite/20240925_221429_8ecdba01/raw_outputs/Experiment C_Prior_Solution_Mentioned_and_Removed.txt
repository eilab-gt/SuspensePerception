**Answer 1:** 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, making it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap.

**Answer 2:** 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive and at the mercy of their captors. The sudden introduction of a large bird crashing into the window, the darkness, and the appearance of the large and ugly man create a sense of unease and foreboding, making the passage very suspenseful.
