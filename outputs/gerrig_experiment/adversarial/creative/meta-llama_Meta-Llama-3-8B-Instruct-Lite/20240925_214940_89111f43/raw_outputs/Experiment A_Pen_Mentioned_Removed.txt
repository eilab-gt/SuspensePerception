Based on the passage, I would answer:

Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

1. Not very likely

Bond has been overpowered, and Le Chiffre has taken away his gun and his fountain pen, which was his last means of defense. He is being held by two gunmen and Le Chiffre himself, making it unlikely that he will escape without some sort of outside help or clever thinking on his part.

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where the protagonist, Bond, is in a precarious position, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape or what will happen to him. The passage creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like they are on the edge of their seat, waiting for Bond to make a move or find a way out of the predicament.
