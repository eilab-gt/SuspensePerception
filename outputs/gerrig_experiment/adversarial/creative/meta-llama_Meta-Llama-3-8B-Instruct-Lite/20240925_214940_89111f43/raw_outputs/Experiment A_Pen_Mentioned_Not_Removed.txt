Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

Bond is in a difficult situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and has already suffered some damage from the Corsican's swift action. This suggests that his escape is unlikely at this point.

Answer to Question 2:
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful due to the rapid and intense action, the unexpected twists and turns, and the sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and the author's vivid descriptions of the action and settings create a sense of tension and excitement. The use of words like "lightning," "whistled," and "brusquely" adds to the sense of urgency and drama, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
