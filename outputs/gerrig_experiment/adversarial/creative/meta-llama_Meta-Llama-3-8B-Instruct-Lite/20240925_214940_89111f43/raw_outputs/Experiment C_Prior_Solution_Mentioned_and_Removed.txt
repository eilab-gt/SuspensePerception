**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and others, and is being tied up in a chair. He is at the mercy of his captors, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes, intense, and potentially deadly situation. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from his captors, and whether he will be able to outsmart them or be forced to fight for his life. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly man", "contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", and "bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", adds to the sense of tension and foreboding.
