Answer 1: 1. Not very likely
It's not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, as he is trapped and outnumbered by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Despite his agility and quick thinking, Bond is still at a disadvantage and seems to be at the mercy of his captors.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful
This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and urgency. The sudden and unexpected invasion of Bond's hotel room, the use of guns, and the physical confrontation between Bond and the gunmen all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Bond's struggles and feelings of impotence also heighten the sense of suspense, making the reader worry about his fate.
