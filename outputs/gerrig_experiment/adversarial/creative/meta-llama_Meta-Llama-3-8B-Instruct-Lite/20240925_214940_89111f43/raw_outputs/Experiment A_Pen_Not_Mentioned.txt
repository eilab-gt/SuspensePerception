Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught and is being held by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, with Le Chiffre himself wielding a gun, and is currently being frisked for any remaining weapons. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are low at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The use of phrases such as "Le Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the right. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons." and "The two gunmen dragged Bond to his feet. While the thin man kept his gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest, the Corsican roughly stripped Bond's revolver out of its shoulder holster." creates a sense of foreboding and raises questions about what will happen to Bond. The fact that Bond is being caught and held captive by Le Chiffre and his henchmen adds to the suspense. The tone of the passage is also ominous, which contributes to the overall sense of suspense.
