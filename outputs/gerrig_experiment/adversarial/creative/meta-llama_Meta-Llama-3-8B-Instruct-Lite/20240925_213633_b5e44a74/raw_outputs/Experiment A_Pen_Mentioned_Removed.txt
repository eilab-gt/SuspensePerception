Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently in a precarious situation, having been caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and is likely to face physical harm or worse. Given the circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a tense and high-stakes situation where Bond is being captured by his enemies and is at risk of being harmed. The use of words like "threw himself down the passage", "hurled himself", and "crashed to the ground" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel on the edge of their seat. The fact that Bond is able to sneak his fountain pen into his pocket adds a sense of tension and unpredictability to the situation, making the passage even more suspenseful.
