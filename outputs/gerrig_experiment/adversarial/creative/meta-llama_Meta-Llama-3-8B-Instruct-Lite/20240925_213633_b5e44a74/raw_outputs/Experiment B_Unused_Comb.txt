Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given the fact that Bond has been captured and is now the prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it's unlikely that he will escape from his current situation.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful due to the unexpected twists and turns in the story. The use of phrases such as "filled with confidence after defeating Le Chiffre" and "filled with confidence after defeating Le Chiffre" creates a sense of uncertainty, and the description of Bond being trapped and searched by the men creates a sense of tension and danger. The fact that Bond is being held captive and has limited options for escape adds to the suspense, making the passage very suspenseful.
