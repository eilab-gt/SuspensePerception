Answering Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would choose option 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and it seems that Blofeld has taken measures to ensure that Bond will not escape. The large man, Crushak, has pinned Bond in a chair using piano wire, and Blofeld has expressed his intention to "leave" Bond with Crushak to "contemplate his rude behavior". This suggests that Bond's escape is not imminent.

Answering Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would choose option 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tense and ominous elements, including Bond's capture, the menacing behavior of Blofeld and Crushak, and the increasingly dire circumstances Bond finds himself in. The sudden appearance of the large bird, the flash of light from the hall, and the emergence of another gun all contribute to a sense of tension and uncertainty, making it a highly suspenseful passage.
