Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen, with wires wrapped around his arms and pinning him to a chair. This does not seem like a favorable position for him to escape from. Blofeld has also stated that he has had enough of being thwarted by Bond and is determined to stop him, making it even less likely that Bond will be able to escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by a formidable foe. The atmosphere is tense, with Blofeld's words and actions indicating that he intends to keep Bond under his control. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on Blofeld. The use of dark, claustrophobic settings, such as the office with its wire-wrapped chair and flickering light, adds to the sense of tension and foreboding.
