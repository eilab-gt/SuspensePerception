Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, being trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen, and with no clear way to escape. Bond is physically restrained by Crushak, who has been instructed to shoot him if he tries to speak. The situation seems hopeless, making it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The sudden appearance of a large bird crashing into the wall, the menacing tone of Blofeld, and the physical restraints used by Crushak all contribute to a sense of high stakes and imminent danger. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia and fear, as Bond is trapped and helpless against his captors. The use of dark lighting and the sudden switch to a new, intense scene (the large man with a gun pointing at Blofeld's chest) adds to the suspense and creates a sense of uncertainty, making it hard to predict what will happen next.
