Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is now a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and there is no indication of an easy way for him to escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful, as it describes a tense and threatening situation where the protagonist, Alex, is captured and tied up by his captors, and is being threatened with harm by a large and ugly man, Jordan. The use of words like "pinch", "painfully", and "irritations" also adds to the suspense, as it creates a sense of discomfort and danger.
