**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

I would rate it as: 1. Not very likely. The passage states that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that their situation is dire and they are in a vulnerable position.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

I would rate it as: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as the protagonist, Riley, is being captured and restrained by a large and ugly man. The threat of death and the use of physical force creates a high level of suspense, and the reader is left wondering if Riley will be able to escape or if he will meet a tragic end.
