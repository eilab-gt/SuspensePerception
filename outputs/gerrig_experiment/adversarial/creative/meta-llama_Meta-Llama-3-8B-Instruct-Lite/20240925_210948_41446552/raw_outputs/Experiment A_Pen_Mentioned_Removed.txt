**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is being overpowered by Le Chiffre's men, and he is being searched and disarmed. This implies that Bond's chances of escape are low.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is being captured and disarmed, and there is a sense of urgency and tension in the actions of the characters. The use of words like "crashed to the ground", "shot out his left hand", and "twisted it sharply" creates a sense of action and danger, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat. The sudden shift from Bond's attempts to escape to being overpowered creates a sense of unpredictability, adding to the suspense.
