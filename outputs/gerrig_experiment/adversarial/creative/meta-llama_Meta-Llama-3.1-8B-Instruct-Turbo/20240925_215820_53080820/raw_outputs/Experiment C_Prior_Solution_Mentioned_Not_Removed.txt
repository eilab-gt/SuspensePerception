***Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?***

Considering Bond is already a prisoner of Blofeld and two gunmen, and he's being restrained with piano wire, it's unlikely he'll escape without a plan. However, Bond is a skilled spy, and given the unexpected events in the passage, such as the bird crashing into the wall and Blofeld's clumsiness, I would say that it's not entirely impossible for Bond to escape. Therefore, the answer would be:

**5. Moderately likely**

***Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?***

The passage is full of unexpected events, sudden twists, and a bit of humor, which creates tension and suspense. The sudden appearances of the bird and the large man, Blofeld's clumsiness, and Bond's ability to exploit these distractions all contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere. However, the fact that the passage reveals that Blofeld ultimately meets his demise in an accident after this scene might reduce the sense of immediate danger, making it slightly less suspenseful than if it were left unknown. Nevertheless, the passage still effectively builds tension and is engaging. Therefore, the answer would be:

**5. Moderately suspense
