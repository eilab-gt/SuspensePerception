Answering Question 1: 
The likelihood that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre seems uncertain, but in favor of being unlikely, given that Bond is a prisoner, guarded by two gunmen and Le Chiffre. There are some glimmers of hope, however, as the passage highlights Bond's agile and resourceful nature. So I would answer:

1. Not very likely

Answering Question 2:
The passage is suspenseful because it contains several elements that create tension and uncertainty. These include the sudden appearance of the Corsican, the capture of Bond, and the implication that Le Chiffre has a plan to keep Bond captive. Additionally, the descriptive language used by Ian Fleming adds to the tension, making the passage moderately suspenseful. So I would answer:

5. Moderately suspenseful
