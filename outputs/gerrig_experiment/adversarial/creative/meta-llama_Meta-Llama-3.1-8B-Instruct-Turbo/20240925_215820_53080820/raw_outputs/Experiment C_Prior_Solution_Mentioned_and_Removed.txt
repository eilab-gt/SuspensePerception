Based on the passage, I would answer:

1. Not very likely
It is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld at the moment, as he is being physically restrained by piano wire, and two gunmen are present, with one of them being "devoted to eliminating" Bond. The situation appears to be under Blofeld's control, making an immediate escape seem improbable.

2. Extremely suspenseful
This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, James Bond. The reader is aware that Bond has been outwitted by Blofeld and is now at his mercy. The use of physically restraining wire, guns, and the unpredictable behavior of the characters adds to the suspense. Additionally, the unexpected turn of events, such as the large bird crashing into the wall and the sudden appearance of the second gunman, keeps the reader engaged and uncertain about the outcome. The narrative's dark and intense atmosphere also contributes to the overall suspensefulness of the passage.
