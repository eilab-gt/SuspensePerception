**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, Bond's actions were quite bold and calculated, as seen when he kicks the thin man, and then decides to make a sudden dash down the passage. However, despite his agility and quick thinking, he is still caught by the Corsican who swiftly disarms him. The outcome does not seem entirely in Bond's favor, and he is eventually stripped of his revolver. Considering these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre.

Therefore, the answer is: 1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is quite intense and action-packed, with a rapid series of events unfolding as Bond tries to escape. There is a sense of urgency and a high level of tension, which creates suspense. Additionally, the reader is unsure of the outcome, which adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The brief descriptions of Bond's agility and the quick actions of the Corsican create a sense of unpredictability, making it engaging and suspenseful.

Therefore, the answer is: 6. Very suspenseful
