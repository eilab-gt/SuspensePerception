***Answer to Question 1:*** 
1. Not very likely

Bond is outnumbered by two people, he is pinned down in a chair, and they are essentially untouchable to him as of yet. Given these circumstances, it appears that the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld is not in his favor.

***Answer to Question 2:*** 
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage has a high level of suspense because it includes the following elements: a dramatic moment when a bird crashes into the wall, Blofeld's irritation with Bond, a gun being shot, a large and intimidating man named Crushak, and Bond being tied up and left to contemplate his actions. These elements create tension and make the reader feel uneasy about what might happen next to Bond.
