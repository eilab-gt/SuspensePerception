**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond's plan to cause damage to the two gunmen and have a conversation with Vesper did not go as smoothly as he had anticipated. Le Chiffre and his men were prepared, and Bond was quickly overpowered. Given this, I would say that it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point. Therefore, the answer is:

1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage creates a sense of tension and anticipation as it describes Bond's failed attempt to cause damage to the gunmen and escape with Vesper. The author's use of words like "lightning" and "swiftly" suggests that Bond was caught off guard, and the description of the events that unfolded creates a sense of urgency and suspense. Therefore, I would say that this passage is:

6. Very suspenseful
