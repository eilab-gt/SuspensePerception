Based on the information given in the original passage about 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', I will answer Question 1: 'How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?'

1. Not very likely

This answer is because, according to the original passage, Bond and Vesper are already the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen. Given this situation, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape, at least not without a clever plan or outside help.

Now I will answer Question 2: 'How suspenseful do you find this passage?'

5. Moderately suspenseful

This answer is because the passage about 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' was not given, so the passage I answered from was from a different story. The given passage describes a tense and potentially violent situation with a character being tied up and threatened by a large and ugly man. This level of tension creates moderate suspense.
