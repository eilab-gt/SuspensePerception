**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

Based on the passage, Bond has been overpowered by Le Chiffre's men, and even after taking an action to escape, he is caught and disarmed by the two gunmen. Morgan's presence and the fact that Bond is being searched also suggest that he is at a disadvantage. This makes it seem unlikely that he will escape from Le Chiffre.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is suspenseful because it sets up a high-stakes situation where Bond is fighting for his freedom. The action unfolds quickly, and the outcome is uncertain, which keeps the reader engaged. The use of phrases such as "Like lightning," "As he crashed to the ground," and "Bond rolled agilely" creates a sense of urgency and danger, heightening the suspense.
