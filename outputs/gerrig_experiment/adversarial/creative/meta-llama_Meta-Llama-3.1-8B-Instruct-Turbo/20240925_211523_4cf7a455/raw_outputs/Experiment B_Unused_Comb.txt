**Answer to Question 1:** 
Considering the situation described in the passage, where Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it is more likely that they will be at the mercy of their captors. The fact that they have been caught in a trap implies that their captors have the upper hand. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is not very high.

*Answer: 1. Not very likely*

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is suspenseful because it features an unexpected twist (Riley being one of the three men who burst into the room) and an action-packed sequence of events (Riley fighting off the gunmen). Additionally, the narrative creates tension by describing Riley's vulnerability and helplessness after being disarmed and overpowered. The reader is left wondering how Riley will escape from his situation, which contributes to the suspensefulness of the passage.

*Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful*
