Based on the passage, I would answer:

Question 1: 
The correct answer is 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are already prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen. They have been caught in Blofeld's trap, and it is unclear how they will escape. Additionally, the passage does not suggest that Bond has any clear plan for escape, and the gunmen are described as "two men, short, fat, and with a metallic sheen to their faces, a clear sign of plastic surgery, a sign of long-standing employment in the sort of trade to which they belonged." This implies that they are highly skilled and experienced, making it less likely that Bond will escape.

Question 2:
The correct answer is 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Riley is being captured and held captive by a large and ugly man, and he is aware of the danger he is in. The use of phrases such as "I am not amused by your antics Mr. Riley", "Tie up Mr. Riley", and "He died soon after that in an automobile accident" creates a sense of foreboding and danger, making the reader feel tense and
