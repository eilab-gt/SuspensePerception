**Answer to Question 1:**
Given the situation where Bond is now the prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it's unlikely he'll escape easily. He's been disarmed and already suffered some damage in his attempt to rescue Vesper. Considering his current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is quite tense and action-packed, with Bond's attempt to rescue Vesper unfolding rapidly and unexpectedly. The use of words like "suddenly," "Like lightning," and "agilely" adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is now the prisoner of Le Chiffre and his men also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere. I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

7. Extremely suspenseful
