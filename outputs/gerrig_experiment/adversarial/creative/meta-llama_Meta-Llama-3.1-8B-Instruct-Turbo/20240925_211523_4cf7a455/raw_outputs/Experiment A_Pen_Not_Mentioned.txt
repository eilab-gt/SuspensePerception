Answer Question 1: 
Considering the passage, I would rate it as: 
1. Not very likely

This is because Bond has just been caught by the two gunmen and the passage does not indicate any clear plan or opportunity for escape. Le Chiffre and his men are still in control, and Bond is being searched for other weapons.

Answer Question 2: 
Considering the passage, I would rate it as: 
6. Very suspenseful

This is because the passage sets up a sense of urgency and tension as Bond decides to act and then pursues Vesper down the passage. The quick and agile actions of the Corsican, who manages to trip Bond up, create a sense of danger and unpredictability, raising the stakes and making the reader feel uncertain about Bond's chances of success.
