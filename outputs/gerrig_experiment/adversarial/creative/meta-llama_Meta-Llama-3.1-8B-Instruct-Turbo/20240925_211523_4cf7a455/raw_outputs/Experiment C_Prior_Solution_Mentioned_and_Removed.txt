Based on the given passage, I will first answer Question 1, and then answer Question 2.

Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
Answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage does not provide a detailed description of the situation where Bond is a prisoner of Blofeld. However, it does state that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen. This suggests that they are being held in a secure location, implying that an escape might be difficult.

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage?"
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is suspenseful for several reasons: it contains action, tension, and a dark and ominous atmosphere. The situation described is one where the main character is being held captive, and there is a sense of danger and unpredictability. The fact that Alex is being tied up by Jamie and threatened with being shot if he speaks creates a sense of unease, making the passage very suspenseful.
