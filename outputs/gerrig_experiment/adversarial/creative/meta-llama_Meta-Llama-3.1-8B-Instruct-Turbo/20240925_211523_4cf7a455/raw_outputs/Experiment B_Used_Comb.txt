Answer Question 1:
Given the situation described in the passage, it is likely that Bond is not in a favorable position. Le Chiffre has set a successful trap, and Bond and Vesper are now prisoners. The situation appears challenging for Bond to escape from. However, it's worth noting that Bond's skills and experience are not mentioned in the passage, and readers of the novel are aware of his intelligence and combat skills. Based on this information, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

Answer Question 2:
The passage is suspenseful as it creates a sense of tension and uncertainty for the main character, Taylor (later revealed to be Bond). The unexpected events, such as the sudden entrance of the gunmen and the brief struggle, create a sense of surprise and danger. The reader is left wondering how Taylor will manage to escape or what will happen next. This level of tension and uncertainty contributes to the overall suspenseful nature of the passage. I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful
