Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***: 
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are currently the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Bond has been disarmed and is at a disadvantage. Although he is able to trick Le Chiffre's assistant and hide his fountain pen, it's unlikely that he can escape from their captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***:
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is a prisoner and facing danger from his captors. The passage also creates tension by showing the close calls and quick thinking of Bond, such as when he manages to hide his fountain pen in his breast pocket. The passage also implies that the situation could go either way, adding to the suspense.
