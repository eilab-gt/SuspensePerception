Answer to Question 1: 
1. Not very likely

This answer is chosen because the situation described is that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. The scene depicts Bond and Vesper being searched and having their arms and other potential weapons removed. This situation does not indicate that Bond has a high chance of escape at the moment.

Answer to Question 2: 
7. Extremely suspenseful

This answer is chosen because the passage describes a scene where Bond, who had previously seemed to be in control, has been caught by Le Chiffre and his men. The situation is intense, with Bond and Vesper being overpowered and subjected to searches. The events are unfolding quickly, creating a sense of urgency and danger, which makes the passage extremely suspenseful.
