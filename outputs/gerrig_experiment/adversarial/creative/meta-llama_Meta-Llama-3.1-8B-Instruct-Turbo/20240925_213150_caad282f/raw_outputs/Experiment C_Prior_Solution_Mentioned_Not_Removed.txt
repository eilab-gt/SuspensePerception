Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely
Given the situation, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. He is tied up and surrounded by two heavily armed men, Crushak and the large and ugly man. The room is dimly lit, which would make it harder for Bond to see his surroundings and come up with a plan to escape.

Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful
This passage is highly suspenseful, as it puts the reader in a situation where they are not sure what will happen next to Bond. There are many twists and turns, such as the bird crashing into the wall, Bond's attempt to escape, and the sudden appearance of the large and ugly man. The tension builds as the reader is kept in the dark about what will happen next, making it a very suspenseful passage.
