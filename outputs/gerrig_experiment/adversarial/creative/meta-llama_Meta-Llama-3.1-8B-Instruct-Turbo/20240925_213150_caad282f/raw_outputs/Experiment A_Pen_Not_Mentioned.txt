***Answer Question 1:***
1. Somewhat likely

Bond is a skilled and agile individual who can quickly assess situations and react accordingly. Although Le Chiffre and his two gunmen have the upper hand in this scenario, Bond has already demonstrated his ability to think on his feet and take swift action to overcome obstacles. Additionally, Bond's determination to rescue Vesper and thwart Le Chiffre's plans suggest that he will continue to try and escape, making his chances of success somewhat likely.

***Answer Question 2:***
5. Moderately suspenseful

This passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond and Vesper are taken captive and Le Chiffre's intentions become clear. The use of phrases such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall" and "he righted himself with minimal damage" suggests a high level of action and quick thinking, making the situation intense and unpredictable. However, it is still unclear how the situation will unfold, leaving room for speculation and keeping the reader moderately suspenseful.
