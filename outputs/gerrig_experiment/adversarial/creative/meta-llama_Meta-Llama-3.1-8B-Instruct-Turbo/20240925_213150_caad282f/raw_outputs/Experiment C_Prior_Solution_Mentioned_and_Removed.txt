Based on the passage, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

The passage shows that Blofeld has taken great care to trap Bond, has a devoted gunman (Crushak), and is already treating Bond brutally (wrapping piano wire around his arms and tightening it). This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own.

2. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is filled with action, danger, and twists. Blofeld seems to be enjoying his control over Bond, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next. The introduction of the large bird, the unexpected twist in the conversation, and the sudden change in the room's lighting all contribute to a sense of tension and suspense.
