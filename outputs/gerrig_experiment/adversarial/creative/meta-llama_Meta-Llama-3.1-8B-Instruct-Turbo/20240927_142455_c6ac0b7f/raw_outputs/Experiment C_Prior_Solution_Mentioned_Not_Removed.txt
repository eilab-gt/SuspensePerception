***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage provided, it seems there is no mention of Bond being a prisoner of Blofeld in the passage. However, since it is given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld, we can only use the provided passage to deduce the likelihood of escape. Since no details are provided in the given passage about how many guards, how secure the prison is, and what tools or resources Bond might have to aid in his escape, I would say that there is not enough information to give an accurate likelihood. However, given that Bond is in a hostage situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as follows.

1. Not very likely
