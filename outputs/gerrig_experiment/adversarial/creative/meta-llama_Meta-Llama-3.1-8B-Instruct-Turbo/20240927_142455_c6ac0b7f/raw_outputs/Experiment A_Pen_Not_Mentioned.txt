Based on the passage provided, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 
1. Not very likely

This is because Bond is already a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are shown to be taking control of him and searching for any hidden weapons. The fact that they are stripping him of his gun and being cautious suggests that their control is quite firm.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"*** 
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage has a sense of urgency, and the reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation. The use of verbs like "crooked", "barked", "dragged", "kept", and "twisted" creates a sense of rapid action, and the use of words like "gun trained", "gunmen", and "martial" implies danger. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being taken into custody and searched suggests that something ominous may happen, making the passage quite suspenseful.
