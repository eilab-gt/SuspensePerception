To answer Question 1: 'How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?'

Based on the passage, it appears that Bond is facing an immediate threat and is being handled roughly by the two gunmen. The text states that the men "dragged Bond to his feet" and "stripped Bond's revolver out of its shoulder holster." Given this situation, we can infer that Bond is currently at a disadvantage and not in a position to escape. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping at this moment seems low. I would rate this as:

1. Not very likely

To answer Question 2: 'How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?'

This passage is suspenseful as it portrays Bond in a vulnerable position, being handled by the gunmen, with no indication of how he might escape or the outcome of the situation. The text creates tension through its description of the action, with Bond trying to act unnoticed, and the danger posed by the men handling him. This creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind about what will happen next. I would rate this passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
