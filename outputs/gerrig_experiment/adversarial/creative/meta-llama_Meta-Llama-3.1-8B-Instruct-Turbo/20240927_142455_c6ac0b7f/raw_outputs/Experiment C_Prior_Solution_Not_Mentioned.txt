I'll need the actual text from "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" to answer your questions. However, since I don't see it provided, I will assume that the provided text is another story altogether and use the original prompt as a reference to answer your questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the original passage, Bond and Vesper are already the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen. This situation doesn't suggest an opportunity for escape at the moment. Considering this situation, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage?"***
Considering the context that Bond and Vesper are prisoners, and the fact that they have been tricked by Blofeld, the situation suggests that the characters' fates are uncertain and could go either way, which is a key element of suspense. I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful
