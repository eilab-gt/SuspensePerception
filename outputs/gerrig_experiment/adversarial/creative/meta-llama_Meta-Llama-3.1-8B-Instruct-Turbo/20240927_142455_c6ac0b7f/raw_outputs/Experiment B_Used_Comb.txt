Answer Question 1: 
Given that Bond is outnumbered, and the passage states that the two gunmen have searched him and found his revolver, stripping it from his shoulder holster, it seems that Bond is in a rather disadvantageous position. This makes it less likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Therefore, I would choose:

1. Not very likely

Answer Question 2: 
The passage creates a sense of tension and foreboding as Bond's life hangs in the balance. The sudden intrusion of the three men, the guns drawn, and the process of Bond being searched while being patted down make the scene tense and suspenseful. Therefore, I would choose:

5. Moderately suspenseful
