***Question 1:*** Since Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, it's likely that their situation is not ideal for an escape. Given the presence of two gunmen, it's unlikely that they can escape without a significant amount of effort or a dramatic turn of events. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2:*** The passage you provided does not describe a situation related to 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', but rather an unrelated scene involving a character named Morgan. However, based on the general description you initially provided, I can still assess the suspensefulness of the situation. In the initial passage, it mentions Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld, which creates tension and raises questions about their fate. The absence of explicit information about their situation, combined with the knowledge that they are being held captive by a notorious villain, contributes to a sense of suspense. I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
