Based on the passage provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
My answer is 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld, he has previously outwitted Blofeld's guard in the past, and is shown to be clever and resourceful, such as when he takes advantage of the distraction to pull up a corner of the rug on which Blofeld stood. This suggests that Bond has a good chance of escaping, but it is not a certainty.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"***
My answer is 7. Slightly Extremely suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and are in a precarious situation. The element of danger is heightened by the presence of two gunmen and the description of Bond's physical discomfort, such as the wire cutting into his flesh. The sudden and unexpected arrival of a bird crashing into the wall, and the large and ugly man blocking Blofeld's path, adds to the suspense.
