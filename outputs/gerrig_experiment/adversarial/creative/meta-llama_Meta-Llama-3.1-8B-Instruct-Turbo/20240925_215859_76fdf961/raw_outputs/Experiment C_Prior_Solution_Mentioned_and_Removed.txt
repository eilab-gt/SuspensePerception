**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld seems slightly low at this point in the story. Blofeld has set a trap for Bond, and Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld's two gunmen, including Crushak. Although Bond has managed to create a distraction, there is no clear indication that he has a solid plan to escape. 

So, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as: **3. Slightly likely**

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is highly suspenseful, as it involves a cat-and-mouse game between Bond and Blofeld. The tension is heightened by the physical restraints that Bond is subjected to, as well as the ever-present threat of being shot by one of Blofeld's henchmen. The fact that Bond is able to create a distraction and disrupt Blofeld's plans adds to the suspense. 

So, I would rate the level of suspensefulness as: **7. Extremely suspenseful**
