Based on the passage, I will answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would rate this as: 1. Not very likely

The reason for this is that Bond is already being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak, and another large and ugly man. He is pinned down in a chair with piano wire, and a gun is pointing at his chest. These are not favorable circumstances for escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would rate this as: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage builds tension and suspense through the rapid-fire dialogue, the introduction of unexpected events (the bird crashing into the wall), and the graphic descriptions of Bond's precarious situation. The use of phrases like "painfully into Bond's flesh" also adds to the sense of tension and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
