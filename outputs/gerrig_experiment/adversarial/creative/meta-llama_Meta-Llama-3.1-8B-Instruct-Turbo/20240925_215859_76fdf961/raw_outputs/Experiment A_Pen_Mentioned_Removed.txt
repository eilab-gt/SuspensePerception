Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
5. Moderately likely

While Bond has managed to evade Le Chiffre's initial attack and possibly hide his fountain pen, it is likely that he will be captured or killed given that he is being held at gunpoint by two armed men and is surrounded by Le Chiffre's henchmen. However, Bond's agility and quick thinking suggest that he may still have some opportunities to escape or fight back.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as the reader is aware that Bond is being outsmarted by Le Chiffre, and is in a life-threatening situation. The use of phrases such as "With lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "his plan was to do as much damage as possible" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
