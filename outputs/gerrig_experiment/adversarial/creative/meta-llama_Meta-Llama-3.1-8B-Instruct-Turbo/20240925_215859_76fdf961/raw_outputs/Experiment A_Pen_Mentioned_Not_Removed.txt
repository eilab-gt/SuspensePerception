Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
5. Moderately likely

Bond is able to move quickly and act decisively to escape the initial situation, as shown by his agility and ability to retain his fountain pen. He also uses his physical skills to subdue one of the gunmen and starts to pursue Vesper. However, it is still unclear whether he will be able to escape the entire house or not. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond's escape seems moderately high.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful due to the rapid action and unexpected events. The reader is kept in the dark about what will happen next and the outcome of Bond's attempts to escape. The use of phrases such as "Let's not waste time" also adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The passage creates tension and keeps the reader engaged, making it a very suspenseful moment in the story.
