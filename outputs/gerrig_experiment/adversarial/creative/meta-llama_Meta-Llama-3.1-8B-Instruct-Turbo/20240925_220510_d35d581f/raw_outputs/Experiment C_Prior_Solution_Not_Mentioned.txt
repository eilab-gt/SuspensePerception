**Answer to Question 1:**
Considering that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and the passage does not indicate that they have a clear plan for escape, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

This is because they are outnumbered and at the mercy of their captors, with no clear opportunity for escape presented in the passage.

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as the protagonist, Taylor, is being framed and then attacked by the large man in the office. The element of surprise and the use of unexpected events create suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
