***Answer to Question 1:*** 
Given that Bond is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and that he's not shown to have any immediate escape plan or chance, it is reasonable to conclude that his situation is quite precarious. Therefore, the likelihood of him escaping is relatively low. The correct answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Answer to Question 2:*** 
The passage has elements of tension, as Bond is being searched and taken captive by the gunmen. The situation is heightened with Riley's whispered plan to cause damage, indicating that things are going to take a turn for the worse. The use of words like "gunman" and "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest" also contribute to a sense of danger and urgency. Therefore, I would say the passage is quite suspenseful. The correct answer is:

6. Very suspenseful
