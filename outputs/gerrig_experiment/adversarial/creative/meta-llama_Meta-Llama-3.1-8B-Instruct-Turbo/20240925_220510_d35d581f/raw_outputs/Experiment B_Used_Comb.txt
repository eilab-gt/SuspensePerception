Answer Question 1: 
1. Not very likely

It's likely that Bond won't escape because Le Chiffre and his men seem to have a significant advantage in terms of numbers, and they've already found Bond's revolver. Additionally, the text implies that Bond was caught off guard and was caught with his hands up. This doesn't bode well for his chances of escape.

Answer Question 2: 
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and tension. It describes a quick and intense sequence of events where Bond is caught off guard, surrounded by his attackers, and subjected to a thorough search. The use of action verbs like "whirled," "burst," "twisted," and "leapt" also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere, making it feel like something is about to go wrong at any moment.
