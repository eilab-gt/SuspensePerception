Based on the given passage, here are the answers to the questions:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**
I would choose **4. Neutral or Uncertain**. This is because while Bond is resourceful and able to think on his feet, as shown by his actions in the passage (e.g., hiding his pen in his breast pocket), he is still a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his men. It's unclear at this point whether he will be able to escape or not, making the outcome uncertain.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage be?**
I would choose **6. Very suspenseful**. This is because the passage creates tension and suspense by describing the situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his men, and Bond's attempts to hide his pen and plan an escape. The use of words like "crashed to the ground" and "unquiet chest" also adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage quite suspenseful.
