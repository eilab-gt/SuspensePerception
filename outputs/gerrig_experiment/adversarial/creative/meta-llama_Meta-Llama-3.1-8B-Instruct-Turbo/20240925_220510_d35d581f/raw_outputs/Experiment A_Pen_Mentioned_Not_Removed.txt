**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is trying to come up with a plan to cause damage to the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper, indicating that he has not yet given up. However, he is outnumbered and disarmed, which makes his situation quite difficult. He is trying to secretly conceal a fountain pen, which suggests that he might be looking for a way to defend himself with it. However, this is not a very effective or reliable tool, especially when compared to the guns held by the gunmen. Considering these factors, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Not very likely" (option 1).

**Answer to Question 2:**
This passage is quite suspenseful because it presents a tense situation where Bond is in a difficult and vulnerable position, outnumbered and disarmed. The mention of guns, violent movements, and the attempt to secretly hide a fountain pen create a sense of urgency and danger. The passage builds on the previous information that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, making the situation even more precarious. I would rate the level of suspense as "Very suspenseful" (option 6).
