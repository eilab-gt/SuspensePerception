Based on the passage provided, I will answer the questions as follows:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**
4. Neutral or Uncertain

While Bond is able to use his skills and agility to try to escape, Le Chiffre has a team of gunmen who are attempting to apprehend him, which suggests that escape might be difficult. However, Bond's quick thinking and physical abilities give him an advantage, so it's not clear whether he will be able to escape or not.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is in a life-or-death situation and is being pursued by gunmen. The rapid pace of events and the close calls Bond has with the Corsican, such as when he almost gets his foot shot, create a sense of tension and suspense.
