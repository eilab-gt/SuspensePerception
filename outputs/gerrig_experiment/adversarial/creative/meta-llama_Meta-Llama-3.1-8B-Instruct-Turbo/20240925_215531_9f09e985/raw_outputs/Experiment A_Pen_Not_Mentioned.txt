**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is facing a difficult situation. He has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he's been disarmed. Despite his agility and quick thinking, the Corsican was able to catch his shoe and potentially cause Bond harm. However, Bond's determination and resourcefulness are still evident. Given this context, I would say the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is somewhat low at this point. But, considering Bond's character and abilities, I wouldn't count him out yet. 

Answer: 1. Not very likely

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
This passage has a high level of tension and suspense. The scene is set in a precarious situation where Bond is a captive, and he's facing two gunmen and the cunning Le Chiffre. The dynamic movement, quick actions, and the attempt by the Corsican to catch Bond's shoe add to the sense of urgency and danger. The use of words like "While," "suddenly," "hurried words," and "Let's not waste time"
