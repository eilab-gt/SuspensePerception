Based on the passage, the answers to the questions are:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 
Answer: 3. Slightly likely

Although Bond is a skilled and resourceful individual, he is currently trapped in a difficult situation with no visible means of escape. The fact that he was caught off guard and outsmarted by Le Chiffre's henchmen does not bode well for his chances of escaping. However, given his abilities and experience, it's still possible that he might find a way to escape, making "Slightly likely" the most fitting answer.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage be?"*** 
Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it starts with Bond in a seemingly secure position (he's just defeated Le Chiffre and is preparing to dine with Vesper), only to suddenly be ambushed by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The unexpected twist and the high-stakes situation that unfolds (Bond being overpowered and searched) create a sense of tension and anxiety, making the passage highly suspenseful.
