**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it appears that Bond is unlikely to escape from Le Chiffre at this point. He has been caught by the two gunmen, and even though he has shown agility and resourcefulness, Le Chiffre's men are well-trained and are being closely supervised by their boss. Additionally, Bond has been disarmed and his attempts to act are being closely watched by Le Chiffre. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is low. I would rate it as:

1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
This passage is very suspenseful. The scene is full of tense action and close calls, with Bond narrowly avoiding a gun and attempting to communicate with Vesper. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper next. The use of words like "lightning" and "delicately" to describe the Corsican's actions adds to the sense of tension and speed. The dialogue between Bond and Le Chiffre also adds to the suspense, as it suggests that Bond's thoughts are being read and he is being manipulated. Therefore, I would rate the passage as:

6.
