Based on the information provided, the answers to the questions are:

1. Not very likely
2. Extremely suspenseful

Justification for Question 1: Given the description of Bond as being pinned down by piano wire, and being threatened to be shot if he speaks, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape at this point in the story. Additionally, there are two heavily armed men watching over him, which also suggests that escape might be difficult.

Justification for Question 2: The passage creates a sense of tension and danger. The mention of guns, physical intimidation, and a character like Crushak who is described as "large and ugly" contributes to an atmosphere of high tension and suspense. The situation is further heightened by the presence of Bond, a skilled and experienced secret agent, being captured and held at gunpoint, making the reader wonder what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or regain control of the situation.
