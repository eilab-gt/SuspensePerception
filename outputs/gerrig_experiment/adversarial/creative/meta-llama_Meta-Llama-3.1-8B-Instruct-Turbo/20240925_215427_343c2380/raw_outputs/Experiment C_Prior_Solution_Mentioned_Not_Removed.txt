**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
I would choose: 1. Not very likely

The reason for this answer is that Bond has just been caught by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, and is now tied up and in a potentially vulnerable position. Additionally, Blofeld explicitly states that Crushak will be responsible for Bond this time, implying that he has a reliable plan to keep Bond captive.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
I would choose: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it depicts Bond in a desperate and vulnerable situation, with a powerful and ruthless adversary, Blofeld, having the upper hand. The use of quick, punchy sentences and descriptive language ("the large bird crashed into the wall of glass", "the large and very ugly man", "the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh") creates a sense of tension and urgency, making the reader wonder how Bond will escape and what fate awaits him.
