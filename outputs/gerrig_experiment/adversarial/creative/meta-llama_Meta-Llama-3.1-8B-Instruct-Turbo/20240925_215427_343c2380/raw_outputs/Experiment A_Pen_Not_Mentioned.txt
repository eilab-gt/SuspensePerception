Based on the passage provided, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 
2. Somewhat likely

The passage shows that Bond was able to successfully counterattack and take down one of the gunmen. However, he was eventually subdued and disarmed by the other gunman and Le Chiffre's control over the situation. Therefore, it seems that Bond may still be able to escape, but it is not a guaranteed outcome.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"*** 
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it shows Bond's quick thinking and agility as he attempts to escape from the gunmen. The use of phrases like "like lightning" and the description of Bond's movements emphasize the urgency and tension of the situation. Additionally, the fact that Bond is eventually subdued and disarmed raises questions about how he will be able to escape and what will happen to him next.
