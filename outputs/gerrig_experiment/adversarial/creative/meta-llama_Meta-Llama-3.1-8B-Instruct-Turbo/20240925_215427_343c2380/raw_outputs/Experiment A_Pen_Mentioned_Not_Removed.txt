**Answer to Question 1:** 
Based on the passage, it appears that Bond's chances of escape are low because Le Chiffre and his men have the upper hand. Bond is overpowered, being held by two gunmen, and Le Chiffre is in control, ordering his men to strip Bond's gun. The passage does not indicate any specific plan or opportunity for Bond to escape, making option 1: "Not very likely" the most fitting answer.

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is suspenseful because it depicts a tense situation with Bond being overpowered and in the control of the villainous Le Chiffre. The use of quick and precise movements by the Corsican gunman to take down Bond adds to the suspense, suggesting that Bond's actions are being closely watched and that he is in danger. This tension builds anticipation for what might happen next, making option 7: "Extremely suspenseful" the most fitting answer.
