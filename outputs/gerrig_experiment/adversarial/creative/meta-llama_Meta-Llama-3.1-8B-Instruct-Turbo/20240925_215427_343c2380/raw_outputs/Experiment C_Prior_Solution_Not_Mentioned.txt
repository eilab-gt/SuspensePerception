**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

It's unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld at this point because he is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, and there are two heavily armed men, including a large and ugly man named Crushak, watching him. The circumstances don't favor Bond's chances of escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it has several elements that contribute to the tension, including:

- A dramatic and unexpected interruption by the bird crashing into the wall of glass.
- A gunfight that ends with Bond being tied up.
- The introduction of a menacing figure like Crushak, who is described as "large and ugly."
- The realization that Bond has fallen into a trap set by Blofeld.
- The sadistic and sadist- tinged description of Crushak's smile and the way he handles Bond, which makes the reader feel uneasy.
- The tension builds up as Bond is forced to contemplate his predicament.

These elements create a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
