**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

It's unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre because he is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, with one of them keeping a gun trained on him. The fact that the two gunmen are stripping him of his revolver and searching him for other weaponry suggests that he is under their control, limiting his chances of escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is aware that Bond is being held captive and that he is about to be interrogated or harmed, which creates a sense of danger and urgency. The use of words like "barked", "roughly", and "gun trained" adds to the sense of tension and raises questions in the reader's mind about what will happen next. The situation is escalating, and the reader is on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what will happen to Bond and Vesper.
