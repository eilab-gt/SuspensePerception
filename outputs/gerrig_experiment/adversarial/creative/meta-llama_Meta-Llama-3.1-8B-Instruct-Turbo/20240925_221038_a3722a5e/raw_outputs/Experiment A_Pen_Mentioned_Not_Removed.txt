***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He is a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has just been disarmed by the Corsican. Given this situation, I would answer: 
1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. Bond is trying to devise a plan while also pretending to be caught. The reader is left wondering if Bond's plan will succeed and how he will escape. The use of actions such as Bond rolling to the ground and the fact that the reader is left unaware of the outcome of his plan contribute to the suspensefulness of the passage. I would answer: 
7. Extremely suspenseful
