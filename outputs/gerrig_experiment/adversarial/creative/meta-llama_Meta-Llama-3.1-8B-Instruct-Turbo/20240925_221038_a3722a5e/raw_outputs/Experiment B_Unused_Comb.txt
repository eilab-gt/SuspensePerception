**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point. The men, led by Alex, have already burst into Bond's room, caught him off guard, and disarmed him, leaving him at their mercy. The passage describes Bond as "puny and impotent," which suggests that his situation is precarious and that escape may be difficult or impossible.

So, the answer is: **1. Not very likely**

**Answer to Question 2:**
This passage is a great example of suspenseful writing, as it creates a sense of tension and danger from the very beginning. The unexpected burst of the door, the guns drawn, and the swift and violent actions of the men create a sense of urgency and foreboding. The passage also highlights Bond's resourcefulness and quick thinking, which adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering how he will escape from this predicament.

So, the answer is: **6. Very suspenseful**
