**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage does not directly relate to the passage about Bond, but since it doesn't have the same information about the situation Bond is in, we'll continue to use the original passage about Bond.

Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests they are in a precarious situation. Additionally, Bond has been caught by Blofeld's trap, making it seem that Bond may not have the upper hand. These factors suggest that Bond's escape is not likely.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage has all the elements of a tense and suspenseful scene: unexpected events, danger, and captive characters. Riley's situation is dire, and the large and ugly man, Jordan, adds to the tension. The fact that Riley was able to outwit his guard in the past but now is captive, hints at a possible twist or outcome, increasing the suspense. The passage has a high level of tension and anticipation, making it extremely suspenseful.
