Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

It appears that Bond is in a precarious situation, having been caught by Le Chiffre's gunmen and searched for any concealed weapons. Although he was able to momentarily outmaneuver the Corsican, he is now being held at gunpoint, making it seem unlikely that he will escape in the immediate future.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes, action-packed scene where Bond's life is at risk. The use of words like "hurled himself", "crashed to the ground", and "gunmen" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
