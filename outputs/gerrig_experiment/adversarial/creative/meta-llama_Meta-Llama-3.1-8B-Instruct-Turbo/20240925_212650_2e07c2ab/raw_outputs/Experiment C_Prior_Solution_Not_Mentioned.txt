***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Given the passage provided seems to be about Jordan and Drew's situation, not Bond and Blofeld's, I will refer back to the initial passage for the correct context.

Since Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and there's no information in the provided passage about their circumstances or their chances of escape, I will rely on the context given in the initial passage. Given that Blofeld has successfully laid a trap for Bond and that they are prisoners, I would answer that it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

The answer is: 1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage seems to be a completely unrelated scenario involving Jordan and Drew. If I'm correct that the passage is from a different book or situation, it doesn't provide any information about Bond's situation.

However, if I consider the provided passage, it is suspenseful because it involves a dark room, guns, a large and ugly man, and someone's life hanging in the balance. It effectively creates a tense atmosphere.

The answer is:
