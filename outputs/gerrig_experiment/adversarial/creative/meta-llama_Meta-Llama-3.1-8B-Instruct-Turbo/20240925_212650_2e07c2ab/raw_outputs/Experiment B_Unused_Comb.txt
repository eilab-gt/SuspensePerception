Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

The likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is difficult to determine from the given passage. However, considering the context that Bond has been captured along with Vesper, it seems unlikely that he will escape on his own. Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, and there are two gunmen keeping them captive. Therefore, the answer to Question 1 is:

1. Not very likely

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

The passage appears to be suspenseful because Riley is trapped and being searched by the gunmen. The reader is uncertain about Riley's (Bond's) situation, as he seems puny and impotent, and there is no clear indication of how he will escape. The twist that one of the gunmen is actually Riley's recently vanquished opponent adds an element of surprise and keeps the reader engaged. Therefore, the answer to Question 2 is:

5. Moderately suspenseful
