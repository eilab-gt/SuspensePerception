***Answer Question 1***: Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point, since they are being held by armed individuals. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Answer Question 2***: The passage is suspenseful as it describes a situation where the protagonist, Jordan (who is actually Bond), is being attacked and searched by armed men. The passage builds tension by describing Jordan's close calls and his feeling of powerlessness. The use of action verbs like "burst in," "leapt," "twisted," and "searched" also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere. However, since this passage does not describe Bond's (or Jordan's) escape attempt, it is not extremely suspenseful. The most appropriate answer is:

5. Moderately suspenseful
