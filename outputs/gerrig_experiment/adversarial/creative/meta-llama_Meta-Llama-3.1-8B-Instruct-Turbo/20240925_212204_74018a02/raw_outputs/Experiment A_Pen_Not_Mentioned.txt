***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the current situation, it seems that Bond has been caught and disarmed, and he has been dragged to his feet with a gun trained on his chest. This makes it difficult for Bond to escape easily. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre's custody seems low. So, the correct answer would be:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

This passage creates a tense and urgent atmosphere as Bond is caught in a tight spot and trying to think on his feet. The fact that Bond's plan to escape and damage the gunmen was foiled, and the way Jordan and the Corsican easily overpowered him, raises the stakes and increases the reader's anxiety. The passage effectively uses action and dialogue to create a sense of tension and suspense. Therefore, the correct answer would be:

7. Extremely suspenseful
