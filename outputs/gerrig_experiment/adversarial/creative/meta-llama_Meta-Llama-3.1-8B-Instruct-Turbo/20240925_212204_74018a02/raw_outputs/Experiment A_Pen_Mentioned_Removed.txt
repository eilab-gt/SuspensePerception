Answer Question 1: 
Bond has been outmaneuvered by Le Chiffre's men and is now a prisoner. He has tried to fight back but was thwarted by one of the Corsican's quick moves, which suggests that Le Chiffre's men have the upper hand. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping is currently low.

I would choose: 1. Not very likely

Answer Question 2: 
The passage suggests that Bond's situation is precarious and that he is being quickly overpowered. The fact that he is being strip-searched and has been disarmed creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The speed and skill with which the Corsican catches Bond's shoe and the Corsican's willingness to silence Bond further heightens the sense of danger. Therefore, this passage is suspenseful.

I would choose: 7. Extremely suspenseful
