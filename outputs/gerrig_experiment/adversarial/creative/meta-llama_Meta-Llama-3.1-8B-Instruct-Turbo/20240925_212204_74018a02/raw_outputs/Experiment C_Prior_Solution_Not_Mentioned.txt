***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the provided passage, it doesn't directly discuss Bond's escape plan. However, considering the context and the situation, I would say it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld at this point. Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which doesn't suggest a favorable situation for escape.

The answer is: 1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage?"***
The passage is suspenseful because it involves a situation with a gun, a large and ugly man, a confrontation, and an escalation of the danger as the story unfolds. The use of short sentences and the twist of Drew's situation creates tension and keeps the reader engaged. Additionally, the sudden and unexpected events like the bird crashing into the glass and the fall of light contribute to the suspense.

The answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful
