***Answer Question 1:***
Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond and Vesper are already the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen. Blofeld has set a trap for Bond, and he is not shown to be actively working on escaping. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld at this point is low. Hence, the most appropriate answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Answer Question 2:***
This passage appears to be a vivid description of a confrontation between two characters, Riley and Bond, and does not mention Blofeld or Vesper directly. However, since it mentions that Bond has been in a previous situation where he was caught by a guard who later died in an accident, it seems to hint at the darker nature of the story. The detailed and gruesome description of Riley's capture, including the use of piano wire to restrain him, adds to the sense of tension and menace. Overall, this passage has a dark and ominous tone that creates a sense of suspense.

Hence, the most appropriate answer is:

6. Very suspenseful
