**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been caught and is being searched by Le Chiffre's men. Although Bond shows signs of confidence and agility, he has already been patted down and had his gun taken from him. The men are now searching him again, and he is being twisted around. This suggests that Bond is not in a strong position, and it will be difficult for him to escape from his captors. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "Not very likely" (1).

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes Bond's capture and the men searching him. The use of phrases such as "Bond felt puny and impotent" and "he was trapped" creates a sense of tension and danger. Additionally, the fact that Bond has been caught off guard and is being searched and handled by his captors creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about how he will escape. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as "Very suspenseful" (6).
