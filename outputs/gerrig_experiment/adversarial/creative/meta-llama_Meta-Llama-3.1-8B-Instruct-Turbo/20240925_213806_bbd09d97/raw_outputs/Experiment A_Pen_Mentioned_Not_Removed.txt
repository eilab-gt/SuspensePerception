Answer to Question 1: 
Given the information provided, Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being handled roughly and forcibly by the Corsican and Le Chiffre. It seems that Le Chiffre and his associates are trying to disarm and control Bond. However, Bond is able to grab his fountain pen in his breast pocket and kick the thin man, causing him to suffer pain. These actions show that Bond is still taking action and showing initiative, which could potentially aid in his escape. Therefore, I would answer: 

5. Moderately likely.

Answer to Question 2: 
This passage shows a level of action and tension, with Bond being disarmed, then trying to escape and causing physical harm to one of the men holding him. There is a sense of urgency and danger in the situation, as Bond is trying to protect himself and potentially Vesper from their captors. Additionally, the quick movements and silent summons suggest a level of sophistication and stealth, which adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would answer: 

6. Very suspenseful.
