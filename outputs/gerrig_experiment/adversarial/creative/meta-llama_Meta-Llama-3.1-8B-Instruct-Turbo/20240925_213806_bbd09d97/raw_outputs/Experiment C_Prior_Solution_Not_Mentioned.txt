Answering Question 1:

Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is trapped by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the ugly man. Blofeld has him tied up with piano wire, and there's another gun pointed at his chest. There's no indication that Bond has a clear opportunity to escape, and he's being left in the care of Crushak. Considering these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

The answer is: 1. Not very likely

Answering Question 2:

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a situation where the protagonist, Bond, is trapped and being handled by his captors. There's a sense of tension and uncertainty about what might happen next, especially with the guns and unfamiliar surroundings. The fact that Bond is tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen adds to the suspense.

The answer is: 6. Very suspenseful
