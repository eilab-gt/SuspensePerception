Answering Question 1: It is somewhat likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Bond is shown to be quite resourceful and skilled, quickly adapting to the situation and taking advantage of opportunities to counter his captors. He is able to outmaneuver the Corsican and take action to disrupt the plans of Le Chiffre. However, there are also factors that might suggest otherwise (two gunmen, being outnumbered), which makes the likelihood of his escape not extremely high. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of his escape as somewhat likely, which is option 2.

Answering Question 2: This passage is extremely suspenseful. The description of the events is vivid and intense, conveying a sense of urgency and danger. The action is rapid, and the reader is not given time to catch their breath as the situation unfolds. The use of short sentences, action-packed descriptions, and intense emotions (e.g., Bond crashing to the ground, the whistle of pain from the thin man) all contribute to a high level of suspense. Therefore, I would rate the level of suspense as extremely suspenseful, which is option 7.
