**Question 1:**  Based on the passage, I would answer:
1. Not very likely

The reason for this answer is that Bond has been caught by Blofeld and his guard, Crushak, and they have tied him up with piano wire. This situation is precarious for Bond, making his escape unlikely.

**Question 2:** Based on the passage, I would answer:
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is filled with intense and vivid scenes of Bond being trapped, threatened, and fighting for survival. The sudden twists and turns, including the unexpected arrival of the bird and the distracting large man, create a high level of suspense and tension, making it extremely suspenseful.
