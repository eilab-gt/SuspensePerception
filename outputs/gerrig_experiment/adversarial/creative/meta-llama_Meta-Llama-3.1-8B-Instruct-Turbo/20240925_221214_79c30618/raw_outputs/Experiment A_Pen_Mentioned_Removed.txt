Based on the passage, the likelihood that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre appears to be low at the moment. Le Chiffre has successfully laid a trap for Bond, and he and Vesper are now prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. The fact that they are being dragged to their feet and having their gun and other items confiscated indicates that they are in a vulnerable position.

However, considering Bond's skills and resourcefulness as a spy, it's likely that he will find a way to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of his escape as:

5. Moderately likely

As for the suspense level of the passage, it is quite high. The description of the scene, the sudden movement of Bond, and the actions of the gunmen and Alex create a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will escape from this situation.

I would rate the suspense level of the passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
