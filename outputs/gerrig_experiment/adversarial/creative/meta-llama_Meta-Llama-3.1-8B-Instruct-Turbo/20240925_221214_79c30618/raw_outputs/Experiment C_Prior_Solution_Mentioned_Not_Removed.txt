Since the provided passage doesn't mention Bond's current situation of being a prisoner of Blofeld, I'll refer to the initial passage provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage states that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which doesn't indicate a promising situation for Bond's escape. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld is low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage?"***
I don't have information about the suspensefulness of the passage from the provided text.
