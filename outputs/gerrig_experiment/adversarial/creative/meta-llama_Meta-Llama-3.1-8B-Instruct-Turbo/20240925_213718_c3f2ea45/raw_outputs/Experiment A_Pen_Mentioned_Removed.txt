Answer to Question 1: 
1. Not very likely

Bond is already a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been caught in the trap laid by Le Chiffre and is being disarmed. The description suggests that Bond is facing two gunmen, one of whom he is able to manage to kick in the shins, but it is uncertain whether he will be able to successfully escape from the more substantial threat posed by Le Chiffre and his armed men.

1 is the most likely answer because it indicates that there are obstacles to escape and the situation seems rather dire for Bond. 

Answer to Question 2: 
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is suspenseful because it describes Bond in a perilous situation. The author describes the action unfolding in a swift and dramatic fashion, creating tension and uncertainty. The way Bond tries to maneuver, saving the fountain pen by rolling onto the ground and moving it into his breast pocket, leaves the reader wondering how he will get out of this situation, raising the suspense.
