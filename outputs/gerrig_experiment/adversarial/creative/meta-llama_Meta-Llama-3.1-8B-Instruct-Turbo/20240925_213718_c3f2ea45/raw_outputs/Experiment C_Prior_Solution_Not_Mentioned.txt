***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose: 2. Somewhat likely

Although Bond has been pinned down by the piano wire and a gun is pointed at him, there are a few factors that suggest Bond might escape. Firstly, he has already demonstrated cunning and quick thinking, as seen in his actions of pulling up the rug to distract Blofeld. Additionally, the arrival of the large bird crashing into the wall of glass creates a new situation that could potentially distract the guards and provide Bond with an opportunity to escape.
