Based on the passage, I would answer:

1. Not very likely
Le Chiffre and his two gunmen have already captured Bond and Vesper, and the passage describes them being dragged to their feet. However, it also suggests that Bond is planning his escape and taking action, so while the odds are against him, he has a glimmer of hope.

2. Extremely suspenseful
The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond's life and Vesper's are in danger. The use of phrases like "Le Chiffre's plan was to do as much damage as possible" and the detailed descriptions of Bond's actions and reactions create a sense of tension and urgency, keeping the reader on the edge of their seat.
