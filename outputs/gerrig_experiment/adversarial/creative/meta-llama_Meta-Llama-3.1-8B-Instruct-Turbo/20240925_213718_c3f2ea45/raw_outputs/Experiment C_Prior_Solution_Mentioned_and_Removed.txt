Answering Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

Given the information provided in the passage, I would answer:

5. Moderately likely

The passage suggests that Bond has managed to momentarily distract Blofeld and his guards, and he has even managed to disarm one of the guards. Additionally, the mention of a previous escape in which Bond outwitted Blofeld's guard implies that Bond has a history of successful escapes. However, Bond is still captive and guarded by multiple people, which reduces the likelihood of his immediate escape. Therefore, I consider it moderately likely that Bond will escape.

Answering Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage?

Given the description of the situation and the tension in the passage, I would answer:

7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful due to the following reasons:

- Bond is captive and in a precarious situation.
- Blofeld and his guards are attempting to control Bond, with a threat of violence.
- Bond is shown to be resourceful, as indicated by his previous escape and his current actions.
- The introduction of a new gun pointing at Blofeld and the large man contorting his face into a failed smile adds to the tension and
