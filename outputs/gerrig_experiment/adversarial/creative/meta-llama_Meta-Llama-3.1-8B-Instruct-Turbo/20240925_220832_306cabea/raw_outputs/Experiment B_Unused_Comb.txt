***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, Bond is being overpowered by three men and one of them is specifically mentioned as having accurately judged his motion, which suggests that they have some level of coordination and planning. Additionally, Bond is able to defend himself and avoid major damage, but ultimately he is still being searched and disarmed. Considering these circumstances, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage creates tension and raises questions in the reader's mind about Bond's situation and his chances of escaping. The detailed description of the fight scene and the actions of the gunmen creates a sense of urgency and danger, which increases the suspense. The use of verbs like "leapt," "burst," "shove," "twisted," and "search" also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful
