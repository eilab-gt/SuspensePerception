Based on the provided passage, I'll answer the questions.

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**
1. Not very likely

In the passage, Bond is being held captive by Le Chiffre and two gunmen. Although he was able to take down one of the gunmen with a well-placed shove, the second gunman caught his shoe and Bond was then thoroughly searched, losing his revolver and feeling "puny and impotent". Given these circumstances, the likelihood of Bond escaping appears to be low.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is caught off guard by the sudden entrance of the gunmen. The quick action and close call with the second gunman's sharp reflexes make the scene intense and suspenseful. The use of words like "burst in," "guns drawn," and "roughly stripped" contributes to the high level of tension and suspense.
