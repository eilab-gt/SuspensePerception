Since the passage provided does not match the one given in the question, I will provide answers based on the passage you provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Since the passage does not mention Bond or Blofeld, I will answer this question based on the context of a typical spy novel. Typically, in such a scenario, the protagonist (Bond) is in a precarious situation and is expected to escape. However, since I don't have specific details about the situation, I will choose a moderate level of likelihood. The correct answer is:

5. Moderately likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage?"***
The passage does not mention Bond, Blofeld, or Vesper. The scenario seems to be unrelated to the original passage provided. However, based on the information given in the new passage, it appears to be a tense situation where Jordan is caught and restrained. This situation is likely to evoke some level of suspense in the reader. The correct answer is:

5. Moderately suspenseful
