However, I don't see a passage about Bond's situation with Blofeld in your last response. I will answer the questions with the original passage you provided:

**Question 1:**
Given that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and there is no information in the passage about how they will escape, it is difficult to determine their likelihood of escape. However, since they are the prisoners of two men with guns, it is likely that they will face significant obstacles in escaping. Therefore, the answer is:

1. Not very likely

**Question 2:**
This passage sets up a situation where the protagonists are being held captive by the antagonist and his henchmen. The fact that they have been caught off guard and are now prisoners creates tension and uncertainty, which are key elements of suspense. Therefore, the answer is:

6. Very suspenseful
