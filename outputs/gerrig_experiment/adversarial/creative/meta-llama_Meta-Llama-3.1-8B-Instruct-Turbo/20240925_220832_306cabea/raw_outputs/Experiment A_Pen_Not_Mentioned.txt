To answer Question 1: I will consider the text to determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. Since Bond is already being dragged to his feet by the gunmen, and they are searching him for more weapons, this suggests that he is at a significant disadvantage. Additionally, Vesper is being led away from him, and he has not had a chance to act on his plan to 'do as much damage as possible' to the gunmen. Given these circumstances, it is most likely that Bond will not be able to escape on his own. Therefore, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

To answer Question 2: I will assess the level of suspense in the passage. The passage creates a sense of tension as Bond is being dragged to his feet and searched, and the reader is unsure of what will happen next. The author creates suspense by withholding information about the outcome of Bond's plan and the intentions of Le Chiffre. Additionally, the brief glimpse into Bond's thought process before being caught ("Bond suddenly decided. His plan was to do as much damage as possible...") creates a sense of urgency and raises questions in the reader's mind. Given these factors, I would answer:

7. Extremely suspenseful
