**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**
Given the context of the passage, it seems that Bond and Vesper are currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is low at this point in time.

The answer is: 1. Not very likely

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
This passage is a turning point in the story where Bond's confidence has been broken, and he is now trapped. The description of the sudden attack by the three men and the fact that Bond's comb is taken away, leaving him feeling puny and impotent, creates a sense of tension and raises the stakes.

The answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful
