Answer to Question 1: 
Based on the situation, I would answer: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is at a disadvantage as he and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen. There are no indications that Bond will be able to escape easily or with much assistance. This suggests that the likelihood of Bond escaping is low.

Answer to Question 2: 
Based on the situation, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage depicts a cat-and-mouse game between Alex (it seems that the character in the passage is Alex, not Blofeld) and Morgan, and it appears that Morgan is now in a difficult situation. The sudden entry of a bird, the subsequent power outage, and the revelation of a large and menacing figure reveal that there are twists and turns in the story that create tension and uncertainty, which make the passage very suspenseful.
