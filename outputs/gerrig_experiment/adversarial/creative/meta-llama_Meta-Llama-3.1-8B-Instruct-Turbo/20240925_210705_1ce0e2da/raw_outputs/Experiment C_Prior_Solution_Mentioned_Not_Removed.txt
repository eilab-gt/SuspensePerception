Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
The correct answer is: 1. Not very likely

This is because Bond and Vesper are described as prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, indicating that they are currently in a captive situation with little freedom or ability to escape. Additionally, the large and ugly man is holding a gun, making it difficult for Bond to escape.

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
The correct answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This is because the passage includes elements that create tension and suspense, such as:

* A sudden and unexpected interruption (the bird crashing into the wall)
* A quick change in situation (from confrontation to distraction to capture)
* A tense and ominous atmosphere (the use of a dark office, the presence of guns, and the large and ugly man)
* A sense of foreboding (the mention of the guard's death in the previous situation)
* A sense of danger and confinement (Bond and Vesper being tied up)
