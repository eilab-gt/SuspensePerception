Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

While Bond is able to initially escape his captors by kicking one of the gunmen and rushing down the passage, he is soon restrained and disarmed by the other gunman, and it's unclear at this point what his next steps will be or whether he can break free. The passage leaves room for uncertainty, making his chances of escape difficult to predict.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it involves a sudden, unexpected turn of events, with Bond kicking the gunman and making a break for Vesper, followed by a quick and delicate gun disarming attempt by the Corsican, and finally Bond being restrained and disarmed by the other gunman. The tension and urgency of the situation create a sense of suspense and make the reader wonder what will happen next.
