***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape. He has been caught by Blofeld's trap, and there is no indication in the passage of any escape plan or situation where Bond could potentially escape. Therefore, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

This passage is quite suspenseful. The situation is intense and violent, with a gun being shot, a person crashing into the wall, and the main character being held captive. The language used is also descriptive and creates a sense of tension. The mention of a guard dying after Bond's previous escape attempt adds an air of menace to the situation. The overall atmosphere of the passage is dark and foreboding, which contributes to its suspenseful nature. Therefore, I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful
