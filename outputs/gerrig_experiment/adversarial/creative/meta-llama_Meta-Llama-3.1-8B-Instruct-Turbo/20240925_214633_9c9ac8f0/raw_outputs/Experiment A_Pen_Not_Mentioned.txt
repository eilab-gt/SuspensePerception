Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide a clear indication of Bond's ability to escape, but it does show that Bond is a skilled fighter and able to think on his feet. However, Le Chiffre and his men are well-matched and seem to be in control of the situation. The fact that Bond was caught and disarmed suggests that escape may not be an easy option, but the passage does not rule it out entirely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do I find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and tension. The action is fast-paced, with quick movements and sudden turns of events. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape, and the fact that he was caught and disarmed adds to the suspense. The passage also raises questions about Vesper's fate and Bond's situation, which adds to the suspense.
