***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Answer: 1. Not very likely

In this passage, Bond is trapped by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. He has been overpowered and is now tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which causes him pain. These circumstances make it difficult for Bond to escape at the moment, thus, not very likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage has several elements that contribute to a high level of suspense. The unexpected interruption of the large bird, the fast-paced action, and the sudden shift in Bond's circumstances all contribute to a sense of tension and uncertainty. Additionally, the villain's lack of emotional reaction ("I am not amused") contrasts with Bond's evident fear and vulnerability, which heightens the sense of tension.
