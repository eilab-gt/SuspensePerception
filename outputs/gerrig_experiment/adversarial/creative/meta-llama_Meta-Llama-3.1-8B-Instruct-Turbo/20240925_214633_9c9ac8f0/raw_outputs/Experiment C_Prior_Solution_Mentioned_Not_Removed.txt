**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

Given that Bond has already been overpowered and pinned down by a large and capable guard named Crushak, and that he has been subjected to physical torture by the wire bindings, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's captivity. The fact that Blofeld is confident that his guard will handle Bond and that he is gloating about Bond's previous attempt at escape also suggests that Blofeld is confident in his own plan.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and tension. The rapid succession of events and the close calls that Bond experiences make the reader feel as though anything could happen at any moment. The description of Bond's physical pain and confinement also adds to the suspense, as it makes the reader feel a sense of urgency and empathy for Bond. The fact that Blofeld seems confident in his plan and that Crushak is a formidable guard makes the reader question whether Bond will be able to escape, adding to the suspense.
