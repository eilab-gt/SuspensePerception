**Answer to Question 1:**
Considering that Bond is already in the hands of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without any external help. The passage suggests that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, which gives him an advantage over Bond. Therefore, I would answer: 
1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense situation where Bond is in a precarious position, being captured by Le Chiffre and his men. The action is quick and intense, with Bond attempting to escape and fight back, but ultimately being overpowered. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will manage to get out of this situation. Therefore, I would answer:
6. Very suspenseful
