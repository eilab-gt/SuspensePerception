**Answer to Question 1:** 3. Slightly likely

Although Bond is agile and quick-thinking, he has just been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. His attempt to kick the thin man and then pursue Vesper through the passage was thwarted when he was shot at by the Corsican and his gun was taken from him. While he managed to move his fountain pen to a safer position in his breast pocket, this action was not subtle and may have been noticed by Le Chiffre. Considering the odds, Bond's chances of escaping appear slightly low.

**Answer to Question 2:** 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful as it rapidly unfolds a situation in which Bond is being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men. The action is fast-paced and Bond's physical movements are swift and subtle, creating a sense of urgency and danger. Additionally, the reader is left wondering if Bond will manage to escape and if Vesper is safe. The tension is heightened by the fact that Le Chiffre and his men are always one step ahead of Bond, suggesting that the outcome is uncertain and precarious.
