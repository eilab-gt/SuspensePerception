***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
 
Based on the passage, the chances of Bond escaping seem low. He has been caught off guard and has just been searched, which suggests that he is a captive of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Bond has managed to dodge the initial "twist" on his shoe, but he is still outnumbered and at a disadvantage, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping is:
1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is also written in a way that builds up to the moment of capture, making the reader feel a sense of unease and anticipation. Therefore, the level of suspense in this passage is:
