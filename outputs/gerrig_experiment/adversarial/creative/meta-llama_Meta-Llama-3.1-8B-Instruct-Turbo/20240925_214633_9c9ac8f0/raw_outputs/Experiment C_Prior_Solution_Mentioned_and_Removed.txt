***Answer to Question 1:*** 
Given the context, Bond is now being held captive by Blofeld and Crushak, and Bond's wrists are pinned in place with piano wire, which is likely to cause him considerable pain and make it difficult for him to move or escape. This situation does not look promising for Bond's chances of escape, and Crushak's orders to shoot him if he attempts to speak further reduce his chances. Therefore, the answer is: 1. Not very likely

***Answer to Question 2:*** 
This passage is extremely suspenseful as it has a captive situation, a chase (when Bond takes advantage of the bird crashing into the wall), a large and intimidating guard, a threat of death if Bond attempts to escape, and overall a tense atmosphere. The use of sensory details (e.g., Bond's eyes growing accustomed to the dark, the feeling of the piano wire cutting into his flesh) and the manner in which Blofeld and Crushak treat Bond (e.g., tying him up, threatening to kill him) adds to the suspenseful nature of the passage. Therefore, the answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful.
