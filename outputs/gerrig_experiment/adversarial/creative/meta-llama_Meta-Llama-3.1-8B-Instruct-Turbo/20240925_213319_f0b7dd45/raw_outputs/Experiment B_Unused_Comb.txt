**Answer to Question 1:** 
It is likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Although Bond and Vesper are described as the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, the passage suggests that Bond is not yet defeated and is still confident and capable. He is able to throw one of the gunmen, and later smiles at his reflection in the mirror, indicating that he is still in control. This suggests that Bond may find a way to escape.

The correct answer is: 5. Moderately likely

**Answer to Question 2:** 
This passage is suspenseful, as it describes a tense situation where Bond is in a precarious position and being held by Le Chiffre's men. However, Bond is able to show his skills and confidence, and there is a sense of uncertainty about the outcome of the situation. This creates a sense of suspense.

The correct answer is: 5. Moderately suspenseful
