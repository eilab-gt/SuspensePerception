***Answer to Question 1:*** 
Given the passage, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. He has already been caught and captured by Blofeld and his gunman, Crushak. Additionally, Bond's wrists are being pinched by piano wire wrapped around the chair's corners and his arms, making it difficult for him to escape. 

However, Bond does have the opportunity to make a few unexpected moves, such as knocking out the light and pulling up the rug to distract Blofeld, so it's not entirely hopeless. So I would answer: 3. Slightly likely.

***Answer to Question 2:*** 
The passage is quite suspenseful. It starts with a dramatic situation where Bond and Blofeld are face to face, with a gun involved. However, the action is rapidly interrupted by unexpected events, including the bird crashing into the glass wall, Bond's attempted escape, and the introduction of more danger. The tension is heightened by the fact that Bond is being held captive, and he is facing the possibility of being harmed by the gunman, Crushak. The suspenseful atmosphere is also built up by the vivid descriptions of the setting and the reactions of the characters, making it 7. Extremely suspenseful
