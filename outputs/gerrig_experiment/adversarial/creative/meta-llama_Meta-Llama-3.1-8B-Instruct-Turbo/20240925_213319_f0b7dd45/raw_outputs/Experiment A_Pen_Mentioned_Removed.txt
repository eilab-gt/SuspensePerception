Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely
Based on the passage, Bond is caught by Le Chiffre's henchmen and Vesper is being led away. Although Bond manages to twist his shoe out of his attacker's hand and kick him, it's unclear if he will be able to successfully escape from the two gunmen and Le Chiffre. The passage suggests that Bond is being subdued and disarmed, which makes his chances of escape appear unlikely.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful
The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond facing a life-threatening situation. He is being pursued and disarmed by his attackers, but he manages to fight back and potentially hide his fountain pen, suggesting that he may still have a chance to escape or defend himself. The quick pace of the events and the sense of danger that Bond is in contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
