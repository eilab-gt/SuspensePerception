**Answer to Question 1:**
Given the situation, Bond is currently restrained by piano wire and there are two gunmen present, which makes his escape less likely. However, he has managed to create an opportunity to escape in the past, and his resourcefulness has often helped him in such situations. Considering the current circumstances, I would say the likelihood of Bond's escape is **Somewhat likely**, as he has already begun to plan his escape and seems to be anticipating his opportunity.

**Answer to Question 2:**
The passage is a turning point in the story, where the reader is aware that Bond is in a desperate situation, but still holds out hope that he might be able to escape. The sudden introduction of a bird, the violence of the guards, and the complex plot twist add to the suspense. I would rate this passage **Extremely suspenseful**, as the reader is aware that Bond is in grave danger and that the stakes are high. The tension is palpable, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.
