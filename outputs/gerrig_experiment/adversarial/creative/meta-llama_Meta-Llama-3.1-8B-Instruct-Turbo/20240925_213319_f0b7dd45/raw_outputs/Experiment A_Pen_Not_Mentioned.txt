**Answer to Question 1:** 1. Not very likely
It is unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre as he is a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Although Bond is described as being agile and showing some skills in combat, the fact that he is being dragged to his feet and the presence of the two gunmen with guns trained on him indicate that his chances of escape are low.

**Answer to Question 2:** 7. Extremely suspenseful
This passage is extremely suspenseful as it describes Bond being caught, held prisoner, and being manhandled by Le Chiffre's men. The use of action-packed language such as "crashed to the ground", "agilely", "with a motion in which he took great pride", and "hurled himself down the passage after her" creates a sense of tension and urgency, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
