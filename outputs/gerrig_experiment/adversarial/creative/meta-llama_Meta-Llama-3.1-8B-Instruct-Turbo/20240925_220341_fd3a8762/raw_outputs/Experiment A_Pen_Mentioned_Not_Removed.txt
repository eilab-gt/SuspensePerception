**Question 1:** 
Given that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, with the thin man keeping his gun trained on Bond's chest and the Corsican stripping Bond's revolver out of its shoulder holster, it seems like they have the upper hand. However, Bond is a skilled and agile individual, and he manages to secretly move his fountain pen into his breast pocket, suggesting he is still planning something. Therefore, I would say that it's somewhat likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre, although the odds are still stacked against him. So the answer is: 
2. Somewhat likely.

**Question 2:**
This passage is suspenseful because it suggests that Bond is planning to escape, but the situation seems grim. The use of phrases like "his plan was to do as much damage as possible" and "move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, he righted himself with minimal damage" create tension and anticipation, implying that something is about to happen. Additionally, the action is unfolding quickly, and the reader is not sure what will happen next. Therefore, I would say that this passage is: 
5. Moderately suspenseful.
