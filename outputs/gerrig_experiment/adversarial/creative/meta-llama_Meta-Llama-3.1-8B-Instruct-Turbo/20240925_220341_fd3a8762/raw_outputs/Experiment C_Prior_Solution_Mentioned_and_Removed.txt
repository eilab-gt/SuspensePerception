Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"*** 
I would answer: 1. Not very likely

The passage states that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, which suggests that they are in a precarious situation with little opportunity to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and potentially violent situation with a villain, Riley, holding a captive (Taylor) and taking control of a situation that seems to be spinning out of control. The scene is filled with action, and the use of action verbs like "crashed", "grunted", "shot", and "contorted" creates a sense of urgency and drama.
