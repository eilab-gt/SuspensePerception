**Answer to Question 1:**
Given the situation, I would choose **1. Not very likely**. Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre's men and overpowered, and he is currently being searched for any hidden weapons. His attempts to fight back have been thwarted, making it unlikely for him to escape at this point.

**Answer to Question 2:**
I would choose **6. Very suspenseful**. The passage is filled with tense moments and close calls for Bond. The situation is intense, with Bond being pinned down and searched, and the narrative creates a sense of urgency and danger, making it a very suspenseful passage.
