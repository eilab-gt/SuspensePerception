Based on the passage, the situation seems grim for Bond as he is a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. The fact that Le Chiffre's plan has been successful and Bond is being subdued suggests that the situation is dire for Bond. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

This makes the reader wonder what will happen next, creating a sense of suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as:

5. Moderately suspenseful
