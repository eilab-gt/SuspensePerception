To answer Question 1 from the provided excerpt is incorrect because the information given about the excerpt from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' was supposed to answer it, but the provided excerpt was different.

So I will make an educated guess by combining the provided information with my general knowledge of the James Bond series. 

Question 1: Given that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, it is likely that they are in a precarious situation with limited freedom. Considering Bond's character and the situation, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping is low. Therefore, the answer is:

1. Not very likely

To answer Question 2 from the provided excerpt is also incorrect because the information given about the excerpt from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' was supposed to answer it, but the provided excerpt was different.

However, I can make an educated guess by combining the provided information with the context of the James Bond series. The passage you provided does seem to be suspenseful, with elements of surprise, such as the bird crashing into the glass and Morgan's unexpected actions.

Question 2: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, I would say that the level of suspense is:

7. Extremely suspenseful
