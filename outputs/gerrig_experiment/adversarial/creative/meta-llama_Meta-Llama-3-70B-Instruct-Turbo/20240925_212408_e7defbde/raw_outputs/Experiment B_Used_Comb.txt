I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the initial description. The passage appears to be about a character named Jordan, not James Bond, and does not mention Vesper or Le Chiffre.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Taylor?"***
I would answer: 3. Slightly likely. The passage shows Jordan trying to defend himself, but ultimately getting caught and trapped. Although he manages to land a good shove, he's eventually overpowered and disarmed.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage has some intense moments, such as the sudden burst of the door, the fight, and the searching of Jordan. The tone is ominous, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Jordan next. However, the suspense is not extremely high, as the passage is more focused on the action and Jordan's attempts to defend himself rather than building up to a cliffhanger.
