I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the initial description. The passage appears to be a different scene with different characters, including Jordan, Drew, and Cameron.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the initial description:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond is a skilled agent, but Blofeld has laid a successful trap, and Bond is currently a prisoner. It's uncertain how Bond will escape or if he will escape at all.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's predicament as a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper. However, the passage is brief and doesn't build up to a climactic moment, so the suspense is moderate rather than extreme.
