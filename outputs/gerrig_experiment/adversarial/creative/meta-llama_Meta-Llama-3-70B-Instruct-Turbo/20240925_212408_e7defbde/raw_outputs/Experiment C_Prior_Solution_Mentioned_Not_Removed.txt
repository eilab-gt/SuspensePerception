It seems like you've provided a different excerpt from the book. The original passage mentioned James Bond, Blofeld, and Vesper, but this new passage mentions Riley, Mr. Riley, and Jordan. I'll answer the questions based on this new passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from Mr. Riley?"***
I would choose option 2: Somewhat likely. The passage shows Riley trying to escape, but ultimately being caught and tied up by Jordan. However, since Riley was able to outwit a guard in a previous encounter, it's possible that he might find a way to escape again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Riley being held at gunpoint, trying to escape, and ultimately being tied up and threatened. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
