It seems there's been a mistake! The provided passage doesn't match the original description. The passage appears to be a different scene, possibly with a character named Riley, and not Bond and Vesper. 

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from the situation?"***
Since Riley is trapped and outnumbered, I'll choose:
4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage has some action and tension, but it's not extremely intense. I'll choose:
5. Moderately suspenseful
