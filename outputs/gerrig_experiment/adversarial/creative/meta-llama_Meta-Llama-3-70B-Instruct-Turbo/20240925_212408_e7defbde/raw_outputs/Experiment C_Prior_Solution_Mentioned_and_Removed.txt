I apologize, but it seems you provided a different passage than the original one mentioned. The passage you provided does not mention James Bond, Blofeld, or Vesper, which are the main characters in the original passage.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the new passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from his captors?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Alex being captured and tied up, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Alex being captured, threatened, and tied up. The mention of the guard's previous death and the orders to shoot Alex if he speaks adds to the sense of danger and suspense.
