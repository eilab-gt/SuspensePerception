I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the original text. The original text describes a scene from Ian Fleming's novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", while the provided passage appears to be a different scene from a different story.

However, I can answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from Jordan?"***
Since Alex is currently tied up and at the mercy of Jordan and his henchman, I would say that it's not very likely that Alex will escape. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Alex being captured and threatened by Jordan and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly man" and "painfully into Alex's flesh", adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would say that the passage is:

6. Very suspenseful
