I think there may be a mistake here. The passage provided doesn't seem to match the description of the excerpt from Ian Fleming's "Casino Royale". The passage appears to be about a character named Jordan, not James Bond. 

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the passage provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Alex?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't give enough information to determine the likelihood of Jordan's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 5: Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger with the sudden invasion of Jordan's hotel room and the subsequent search and disarming of Jordan. However, it's a relatively short passage, and the level of suspense is not extreme.
