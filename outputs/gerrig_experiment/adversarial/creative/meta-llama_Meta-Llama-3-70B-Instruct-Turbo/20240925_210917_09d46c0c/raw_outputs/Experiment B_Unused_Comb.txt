I apologize, but it seems that the passage provided does not match the original description. The passage appears to be a different scene, involving a character named Jordan, and not James Bond and Vesper.

To answer the questions, I would need the correct passage from Ian Fleming's "Casino Royale". If you could provide the correct passage, I would be happy to assist you.

However, if you'd like, I can try to answer the questions based on the provided passage, keeping in mind that it's not the correct passage. Here are my answers:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Jordan?"***
Since the passage doesn't provide clear context or clues about Jordan's chances of escape, I would choose:
4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage has some intense moments, such as the sudden invasion of Jordan's room and the rough handling by the gunmen. However, the tone of the passage seems more focused on Jordan's pride in his abilities and his reactions to the situation, which somewhat reduces the suspense. I would choose:
5. Moderately suspenseful
