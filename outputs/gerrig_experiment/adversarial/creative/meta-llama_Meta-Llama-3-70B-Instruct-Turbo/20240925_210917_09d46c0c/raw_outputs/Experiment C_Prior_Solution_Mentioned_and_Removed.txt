I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the original passage mentioned. The original passage was from Ian Fleming's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", but the passage provided appears to be from a different story. 

However, I can still answer the questions based on the new passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from Alex?"***
I would answer: 2. Somewhat likely. The passage shows Riley attempting to escape, but being caught and restrained by Alex and his accomplice. While Riley has shown some resourcefulness in the past, his current situation seems precarious.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Riley trying to escape and being caught, and the threat of being shot if he speaks. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly man" and "piano wire bit more painfully into Riley's flesh", adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
