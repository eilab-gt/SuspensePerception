I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional text you provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, which suggests that Bond's chances of escape are not great. However, James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and it's possible that he might find a way to escape. Without more information, it's difficult to say how likely it is that Bond will escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger by describing Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. This situation is inherently suspenseful, as the reader wonders what will happen to them next. However, the passage is relatively short and doesn't reveal much about Blofeld's plans or the exact nature of the danger they're in, which limits the level of suspense.
