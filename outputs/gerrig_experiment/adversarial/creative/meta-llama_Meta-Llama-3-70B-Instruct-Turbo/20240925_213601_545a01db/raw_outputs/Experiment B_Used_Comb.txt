I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional text provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. It simply states that Bond and Vesper are prisoners, but it doesn't give any hints about their chances of escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond creates a sense of danger and raises questions about what will happen next. However, the passage is relatively short and doesn't build up to a cliffhanger, which is why I wouldn't rate it as extremely suspenseful.
