I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional passage provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I'll choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine Bond's chances of escape. While Bond has been outsmarted by Blofeld and is currently a prisoner, Bond's history of escaping from difficult situations makes it difficult to predict his fate.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I'll choose answer 5: Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates tension by placing Bond and Vesper in a precarious situation, prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape, which creates suspense. However, the passage is more of a setup for the rest of the story, and the suspense is not extremely high at this point.
