I'll answer the questions based on the original passage provided, not the additional passage that was added.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't give any clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. It sets up a precarious situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners, but it doesn't provide enough information to make a judgment about the likelihood of Bond's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. The situation is precarious, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. However, the passage is more of a setup for the situation rather than an intense action sequence, which is why I wouldn't rate it as extremely suspenseful.
