I'll answer the questions based on the original passage, not the additional text.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, so it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape. However, the passage doesn't provide any hints or clues about how Bond might escape, so it's impossible to say for certain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 5: Moderately suspenseful. The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen. The fact that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond creates a sense of danger and raises questions about how Bond will get out of this situation. However, the passage doesn't have any particularly dramatic or intense moments, so the suspense is moderate rather than extreme.
