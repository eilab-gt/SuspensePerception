***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. However, it's a James Bond story, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from tight spots. There's no clear indication in the passage whether Bond will escape or not, so I'm neutral on the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being captured and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the "painfully" twisting piano wire, adds to the sense of unease. The sudden introduction of unexpected events, like the bird crashing into the glass wall, also increases the suspense. The passage effectively builds tension and leaves the reader wondering what will happen to Bond next.
