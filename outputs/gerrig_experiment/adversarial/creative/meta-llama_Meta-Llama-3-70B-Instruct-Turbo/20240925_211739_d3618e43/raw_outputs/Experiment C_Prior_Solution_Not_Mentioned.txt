It seems that the provided passage is not the correct one, as it doesn't match the description of the excerpt from Ian Fleming's tenth James Bond novel, 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Drew will escape from Jordan and Cameron?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Drew's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Drew being trapped and threatened by Jordan and Cameron, and the use of vivid descriptions like the contorted face and painful wire binding adds to the suspense.
