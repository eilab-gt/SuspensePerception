I apologize, but it seems that the passage provided is not the correct answer to the questions. The passage appears to be describing a scene involving a character named Taylor, Jordan, and other characters, whereas the initial prompt mentioned a passage from Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, 'Casino Royale', featuring James Bond, Le Chiffre, and Vesper.

To answer the original questions, I would need the correct passage from 'Casino Royale'. However, based on the initial prompt, I can try to provide answers:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Since Bond is a skilled secret agent and the protagonist of the story, I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Given that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful
