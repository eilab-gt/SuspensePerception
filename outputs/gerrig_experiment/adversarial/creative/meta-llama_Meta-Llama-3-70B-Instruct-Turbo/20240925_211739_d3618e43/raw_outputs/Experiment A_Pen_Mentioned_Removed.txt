I apologize, but the passage provided is not the same as the one described in the initial prompt. However, I can still answer the questions based on the new passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Considering the situation described in the passage, where Bond is being searched and disarmed by Le Chiffre's gunmen, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping is:
2. Somewhat likely

Bond is a skilled agent, and we know from the initial prompt that he has already caused Le Chiffre to lose a considerable amount of money. However, in this passage, he seems to be at a disadvantage, being outnumbered and outgunned.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would rate the suspense level of this passage as:
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with action, and Bond is in a precarious situation. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape, and the tension is heightened by the mention of the gunmen, the search, and the removal of Bond's weapons. The fact that Alex seems to be anticipating Bond's thoughts adds to the sense of danger
