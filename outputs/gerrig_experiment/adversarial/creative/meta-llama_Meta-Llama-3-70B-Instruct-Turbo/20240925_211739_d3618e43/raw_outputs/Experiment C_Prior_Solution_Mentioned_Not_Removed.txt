It seems that the passage provided does not match the description of the excerpt from Ian Fleming's novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". The passage provided appears to be a different story with a character named Riley being captured and tied up by a man named Jordan.

However, I'll do my best to answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Since the passage does not mention Bond or Blofeld, I'll answer based on the context of the passage provided. It seems that Riley is in a precarious situation, and it's difficult to say how likely it is that Riley will escape from his captors. Therefore, I'll choose:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Riley being captured and tied up by Jordan. The use of phrases like "pointing a gun at you", "knocking out the large light", and "piano wire bit more painfully into Riley's flesh" creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about Riley's fate. Therefore, I'll choose:

6. Very suspenseful
