It seems like you've provided a different passage than the original one mentioned. The passage you've provided appears to be a scene where Alex is being held captive by another character, also named Alex, and his henchman Jamie.

To answer the questions based on this passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from his captors?"***
I would answer: 3. Slightly likely. The passage shows Alex being overpowered and restrained by Jamie, and the threat of being shot if he tries to speak to him. However, Alex has managed to outwit a guard in a previous encounter, which suggests he might have some skills that could help him escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere with the use of violence, threats, and physical restraint. The character Alex is in a dangerous situation, and the reader is left wondering if he will be able to escape or if he will be harmed or killed. The passage builds suspense by introducing the henchman Jamie, who seems brutal and efficient, and the threat of being shot if Alex tries to speak to him.
