I think there's been a mistake! The passage provided doesn't match the initial description. It seems to be a different scene with a character named Riley, not James Bond. 

However, I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from his captors?"***
I'll choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't give a clear indication of Riley's chances of escape, but it does show him being resourceful and skilled, which might increase his chances.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I'll choose answer 5. Moderately suspenseful. The passage creates tension by introducing sudden violence and danger, and Riley's situation is precarious. However, the tone of the passage is somewhat lighthearted, with Riley's pride in his agility and the smile from his captor, which reduces the overall suspense level.
