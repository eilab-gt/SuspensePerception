I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the description. The passage appears to be a different scene from a different story, and it does not mention James Bond, Blofeld, or Vesper.

However, if I were to answer the questions based on the original description, I would say:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
6. Very likely (James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's common for him to escape from tight situations in the series.)

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
5. Moderately suspenseful (The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper being captured by Blofeld, which creates suspense and raises questions about their fate.)
