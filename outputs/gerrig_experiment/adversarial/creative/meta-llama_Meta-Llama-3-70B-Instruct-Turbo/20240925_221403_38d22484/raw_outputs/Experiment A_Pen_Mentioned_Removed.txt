Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Answer: 3. Slightly likely

Although Bond is a skilled agent, he is currently a prisoner and has been disarmed. However, his ability to think quickly and make plans (as evidenced by his decision to move his fountain pen into his breast pocket) suggests that he may still have a chance to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The description of the scene, including the "silent, spidery summons" and the rough handling of Bond, adds to the sense of danger and unease. The fact that Bond is trying to think of a way to escape and is being closely watched by his captors also increases the suspense.
