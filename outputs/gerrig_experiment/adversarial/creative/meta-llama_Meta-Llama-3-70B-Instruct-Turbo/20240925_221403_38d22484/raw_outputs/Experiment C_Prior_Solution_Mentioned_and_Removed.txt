I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the initial description. The passage provided appears to be a different story with different characters, and it does not mention James Bond, Blofeld, or Vesper.

To answer the questions based on the initial description:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely (James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's trap.)

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful (The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper as prisoners, and it's unclear what will happen to them, creating suspense.)
