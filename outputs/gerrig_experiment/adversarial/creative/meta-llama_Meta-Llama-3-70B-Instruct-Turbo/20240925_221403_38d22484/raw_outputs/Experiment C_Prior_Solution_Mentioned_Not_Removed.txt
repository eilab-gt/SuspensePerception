I think there may be a mistake here. The passage provided doesn't seem to match the description of an excerpt from Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. The passage appears to be from a different story altogether.

Assuming the passage is correct, I'll do my best to answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
This question doesn't apply to the provided passage, as there is no Bond or Blofeld in the passage.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the passage, I would rate the suspense level as:
6. Very suspenseful

The passage describes a tense and dramatic scene with a character (Jordan) being outmaneuvered and captured by his adversaries. The use of descriptive language and the sudden introduction of a bird crashing into the wall creates a sense of surprise and raises the tension. The character's actions and dialogue also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
