***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has attempted to escape and has shown resourcefulness in the past, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. It's unclear whether he will be able to escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the "painfully" tightening piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from this precarious situation.
