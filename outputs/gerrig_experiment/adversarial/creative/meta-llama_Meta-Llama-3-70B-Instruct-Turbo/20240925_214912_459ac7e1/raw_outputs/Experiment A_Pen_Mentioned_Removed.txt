Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage shows Bond being captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. While Bond is resourceful and tries to make a move, he is ultimately overpowered. However, it's a James Bond novel, and we know that Bond often finds a way to escape from precarious situations. So, it's hard to say for sure whether he will escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense scene where Bond is being captured and disarmed. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "slammed", "sharply", and "brusquely" creates a sense of urgency and violence. The fact that Bond is trying to think on his feet and make a move, but is ultimately overpowered, adds to the suspense. The passage also ends with Le Chiffre's ominous statement "Let's not waste time", which implies that something sinister is about to happen
