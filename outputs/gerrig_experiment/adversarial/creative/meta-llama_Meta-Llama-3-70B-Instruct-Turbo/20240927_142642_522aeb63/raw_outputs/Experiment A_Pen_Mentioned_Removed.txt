Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond is a skilled agent, the situation seems dire, with him being captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre's henchmen. However, Bond's quick thinking and attempt to conceal his fountain pen suggest that he might still have a plan or resource that could aid his escape. The outcome is uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being captured and at the mercy of Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of words like "spidery summons" and "crashed to the ground" adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is trying to think of a way to escape or do damage to his captors adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
