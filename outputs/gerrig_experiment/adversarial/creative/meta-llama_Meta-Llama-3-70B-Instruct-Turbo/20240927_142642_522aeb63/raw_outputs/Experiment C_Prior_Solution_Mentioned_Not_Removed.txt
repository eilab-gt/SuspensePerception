I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the description of being an excerpt from Ian Fleming's novel 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. The passage appears to be from a different story altogether.

If you could provide the correct passage from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', I'd be happy to help you answer the questions.
