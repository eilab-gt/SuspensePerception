I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the initial description. The passage appears to be from a different story, featuring characters named Jordan, Drew, and Cameron. It does not mention James Bond, Blofeld, or Vesper.

However, I can provide answers based on the passage provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Drew will escape from Jordan and Cameron?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Drew's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Drew being held captive and threatened by Jordan and Cameron. The use of a sudden distraction, the bird crashing into the window, and the subsequent struggle adds to the suspense.
