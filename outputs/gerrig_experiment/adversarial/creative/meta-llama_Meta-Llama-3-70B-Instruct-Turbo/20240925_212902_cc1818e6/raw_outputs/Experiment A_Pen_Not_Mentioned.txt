I apologize, but the passage you provided does not match the initial passage. The initial passage described Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, while the new passage shows a scene where Bond is trying to rescue Vesper and gets caught by the gunmen.

Assuming I should answer the questions based on the new passage, here are my responses:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Since the passage shows Bond being caught and disarmed, I would say it's currently Not very likely (Option 1) that he will escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage has a sense of urgency and danger, with Bond trying to rescue Vesper and getting caught in the process. The action is fast-paced, and the situation is precarious, making it Very suspenseful (Option 6).
