It seems that there is a mistake. The passage provided is not from Ian Fleming's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", but rather a different story. I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from the situation?"***
Since the passage doesn't mention James Bond, I'll assume the question is about Alex. Based on the passage, Alex is in a difficult situation, tied up with piano wire and guarded by a menacing figure named Jamie. Given the circumstances, I'd say:
4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with a sense of danger and captivity. The introduction of Jamie, the large and ugly man, adds to the sense of unease. The fact that Alex is tied up and threatened with death if he speaks to Jamie increases the suspense. I'd say:
6. Very suspenseful
