I apologize, but the provided passage is not the same as the original passage mentioned. The original passage only set the scene, while this new passage is a continuation of the story. Based on the new passage, I'll answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I'll choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond is in a precarious situation, being a skilled agent, he might still find a way to escape. However, the passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I'll choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with action, and Bond is in a dangerous situation. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "slammed", "crashed", and "roughly stripped" creates a sense of urgency and tension, making the passage very suspenseful.
