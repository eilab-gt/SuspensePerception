I apologize, but the passage you provided does not match the original passage you mentioned. The original passage talked about James Bond, Le Chiffre, and Vesper, while the new passage talks about Jordan, Taylor, and a hotel room. 

However, I can still answer the questions based on the new passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Jordan will escape from Taylor?"***
I would answer: 3. Slightly likely. Although Jordan has shown some agility and fighting skills, he is currently trapped and outnumbered by Taylor and his gunmen.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Jordan is suddenly attacked, searched, and trapped by Taylor and his men. The use of action words like "burst", "leapt", "whirled", "shove", and "crashed" adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
