I apologize, but the provided passage does not match the initial description. The initial description mentioned that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, but the provided passage does not mention Le Chiffre and instead features characters named Alex and the Corsican. 

However, I can still answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Alex?"***
Since the passage does not provide enough information about the overall situation and the skills of the characters involved, I would choose:
4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage is quite suspenseful, with Bond being caught and searched, and his attempts to escape or defend himself being thwarted. The use of phrases like "whistle of pain", "slammed himself back against the wall", and "crashed to the ground" creates a sense of urgency and action. Therefore, I would choose:
6. Very suspenseful
