I apologize, but the passage provided does not match the initial description. The passage appears to be from a different story, featuring a character named Riley, not James Bond or Vesper. Therefore, I cannot answer the questions based on the provided passage.

If you could provide the correct passage from Ian Fleming's novel "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", I would be happy to assist you.
