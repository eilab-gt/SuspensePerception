Based on the passage, I would answer:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and Crushak is explicitly instructed to shoot him if he tries to escape or speak to him. Additionally, Bond is already a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, making escape seem unlikely at this point.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, wounded, and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. The sudden arrival of the large bird, the unexpected attack on Bond, and the ominous tone of Blofeld's speech all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next.
