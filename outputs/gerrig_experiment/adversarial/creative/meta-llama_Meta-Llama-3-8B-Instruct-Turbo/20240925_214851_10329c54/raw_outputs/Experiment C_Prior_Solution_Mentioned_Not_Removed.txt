***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped in Blofeld's office with no obvious means of escape. He has been tied up with piano wire, and the two gunmen, including Crushak, are watching him closely. Additionally, Bond is injured and in a disadvantageous position. Given these circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of outside intervention or a clever plan.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is aware that he is in grave danger. The description of the setting, the characters, and the actions creates a sense of foreboding and menace. The use of phrases like "I am not amused" and "eliminating such irritations" also adds to the tension. Overall, this passage is masterfully crafted to keep the reader on edge and wondering what will happen next.
