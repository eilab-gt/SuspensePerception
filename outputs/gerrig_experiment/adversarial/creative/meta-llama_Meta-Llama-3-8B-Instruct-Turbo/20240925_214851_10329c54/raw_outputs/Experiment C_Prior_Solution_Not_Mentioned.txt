Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is currently a prisoner, pinned down by piano wire and facing a large and ugly gunman.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because Bond is trapped and facing a dangerous and unpleasant situation. The description of the setting and the actions of the characters make the scene feel tense and intense, with a sense of danger and uncertainty. The use of descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape or what will happen to him next, which keeps them engaged and on the edge of their seat.
