***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they seem to be in control of the situation. Bond has tried to escape, but was thwarted by the Corsican's quick thinking and Le Chiffre's orders to search him. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from their clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage, I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trying to escape, but is thwarted at every turn. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be caught. The use of vivid language and the quick-paced action also adds to the suspense.
