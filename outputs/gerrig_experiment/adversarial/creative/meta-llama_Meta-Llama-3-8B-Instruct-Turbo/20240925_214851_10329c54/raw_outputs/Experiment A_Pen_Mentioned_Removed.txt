Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and that Le Chiffre has taken away Bond's fountain pen (which could have been a potential means of escape or self-defense), it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a situation where Bond, who is a skilled spy and agent, is captured and disarmed by his enemies. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape or find a way to defeat their captors. The passage also creates tension and suspense through the use of vivid descriptions, such as the sudden and violent twist of Bond's shoe, and the sense of urgency and danger that permeates the scene.
