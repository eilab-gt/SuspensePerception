Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it's unlikely that Bond will escape easily. The passage describes Bond being dragged to his feet, having his revolver taken away, and being searched. Bond's efforts to harm the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper are described as a "plan" but the situation seems dire, making it not very likely that Bond will escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a high-stakes, intense situation where the protagonist (Bond) is trapped and outnumbered. The use of action verbs like "dragged", "twisted", "searched", and "crashed" creates a sense of urgency and tension. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will manage to escape or overcome his captors. The inclusion of Vesper, a character with whom Bond has developed feelings, adds emotional depth to the scene, making it even more suspenseful.
