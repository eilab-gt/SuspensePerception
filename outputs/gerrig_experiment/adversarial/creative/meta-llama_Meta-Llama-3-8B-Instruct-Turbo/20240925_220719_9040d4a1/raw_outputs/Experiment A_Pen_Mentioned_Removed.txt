***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner, being held by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed, and his only resource seems to be a hidden fountain pen in his breast pocket. The passage implies that he has been injured and is being led away by the gunmen. Given his circumstances, it seems unlikely that he will escape in the near future.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it sets up a high-stakes situation where Bond is in a precarious position, injured and disarmed, with no clear way to escape. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, whether Bond will be able to use his wits to escape, and what the consequences will be if he is caught. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "crashed to the ground", adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
