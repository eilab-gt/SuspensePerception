Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given the situation where Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape easily. He has been disarmed and is being held by three men, making it difficult for him to break free. The passage also suggests that Bond is feeling "puny and impotent" after being caught off guard, which implies that his chances of escape are slim.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The sudden burst of action, such as Bond's failed attempt to kick one of the gunmen, adds to the suspense. The description of the gunmen's actions, such as searching Bond and taking away his revolver, creates a sense of vulnerability and danger. The passage also uses vivid language to describe the scene, such as "Bond felt puny and impotent" and "the door burst in toward him", which adds to the overall sense of suspense and tension.
