Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and there is no clear indication of how Bond plans to escape or what resources he has available to him. He does mention wanting to "do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen", but it's unclear what his plan is beyond that.

Answer to Question 2:
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are being held captive and are at the mercy of their captors. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and what Bond's plan is to escape. The use of vivid language, such as "spidery summons" and "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest", adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
