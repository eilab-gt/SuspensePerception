Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and there's no indication of any obvious plan or opportunity for escape. They seem to be at Le Chiffre's mercy, which makes escape seem unlikely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's filled with unexpected twists and turns, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The sudden appearance of the gunmen, Riley's resourceful but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to escape, and the ominous tone all contribute to a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is left feeling anxious and invested in the characters' fate.
