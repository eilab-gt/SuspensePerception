Based on the passage from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are likely to be in a vulnerable position. Blofeld has already laid a successful trap for Bond, and it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from their current situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and there is a sense of uncertainty about what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the crash of the bird into the wall of glass, adds to the sense of surprise and alarm, making the passage very suspenseful.
