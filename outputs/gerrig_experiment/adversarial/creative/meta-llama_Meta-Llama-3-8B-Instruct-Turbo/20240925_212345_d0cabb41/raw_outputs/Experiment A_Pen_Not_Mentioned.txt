Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond has just been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are stripping him of his gun and searching him. It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from this situation, especially since he is being held by three trained individuals.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and tension. Bond is trying to escape and save Vesper, but he is being thwarted by Le Chiffre's traps and the actions of the gunmen. The use of quick and intense action, such as Bond's kick and the Corsican's swift response, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape.
