Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is at a disadvantage, being captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre's men. He is also unable to do much damage to the gunmen, and Le Chiffre has gained the upper hand. It is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily from this situation.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a high-stakes situation where Bond, who was supposed to be in control, is now in a precarious position. The use of quick and violent action, as well as the close call with the Corsican's gun, creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or regain the upper hand.
