Answering Question 1:

I would choose answer 1: "Not very likely" as Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and Bond is not shown to have any apparent means of escape. Blofeld's trap seems to have been successful, and Bond's situation looks dire.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose answer 6: "Very suspenseful" as the passage creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The unexpected events, such as the bird crashing into the wall of glass, add to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next and whether they will be able to escape from their captors. The dark and ominous tone of the passage also contributes to its suspenseful nature.
