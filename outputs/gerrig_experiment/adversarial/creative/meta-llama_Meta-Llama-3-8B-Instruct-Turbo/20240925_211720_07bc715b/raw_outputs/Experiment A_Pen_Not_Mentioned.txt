Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently at a disadvantage. He has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and his attempts to escape have been thwarted. The Corsican was able to twist Bond's shoe out of the way, causing him to crash to the ground, and the two gunmen were able to disarm and strip Bond of his revolver. Given this situation, I would choose:

1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond's chances of escape are low at this point.

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I find this passage to be:

6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tense action, with Bond trying to escape and Le Chiffre's gunmen working to capture him. The sudden twists and turns, such as the Corsican's quick and delicate shot out of his left hand, keep the reader on edge and wondering what will happen next. The passage effectively builds tension and creates a sense of urgency, making it very suspenseful.
