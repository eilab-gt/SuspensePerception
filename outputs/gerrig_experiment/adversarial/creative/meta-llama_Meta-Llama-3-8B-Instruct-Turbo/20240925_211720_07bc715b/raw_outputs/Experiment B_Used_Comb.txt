Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

Based on the passage, Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Bond has been overpowered and disarmed. Given these circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Answer to Question 2:
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense moment in the story. The sudden arrival of the gunmen, the violent struggle, and the feeling of helplessness and impotence that Taylor (and by extension, Bond) experiences creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way out of this predicament.
