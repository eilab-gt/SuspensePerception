***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer 1. Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, and they seem to be in a precarious situation. The fact that Blofeld has successfully trapped Bond and Vesper suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim at the moment.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer 6. Very suspenseful. This passage is very intense and suspenseful, with a lot of action and tension. The sudden crash of the bird into the wall, the gunfight, and the attempted escape all contribute to a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that the characters are trapped and at the mercy of their captors adds to the sense of suspense and uncertainty.
