Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. Given the circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will escape without a significant effort or plan.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger from the start. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped, and the scene is set for a potentially violent confrontation. The descriptive language used to paint the scene, such as the "large bird" crashing into the wall and the "ugly" man, adds to the suspense. Overall, the passage effectively builds tension and anticipation, making it a thrilling and suspenseful read.
