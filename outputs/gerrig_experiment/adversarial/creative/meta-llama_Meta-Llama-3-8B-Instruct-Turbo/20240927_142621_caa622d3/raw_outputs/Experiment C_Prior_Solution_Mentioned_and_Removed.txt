I think there might have been a mistake in the passage. The provided passage seems to be from a different story, not Ian Fleming's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". The original passage mentioned Bond and Vesper being the prisoners of Blofeld, but the provided passage talks about Morgan, Taylor, and Crushak.

However, I'll try to answer the questions based on the original passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are prisoners, and they're in the hands of Blofeld and his gunmen. Without any information about Bond's skills or the situation, it seems unlikely that they will escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper trapped and no clear escape plan. The fact that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for Bond adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will get out of this situation.
