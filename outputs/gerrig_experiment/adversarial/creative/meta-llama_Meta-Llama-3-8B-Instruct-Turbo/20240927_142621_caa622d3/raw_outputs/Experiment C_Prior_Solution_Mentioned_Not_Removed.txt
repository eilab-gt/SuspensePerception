I apologize, but the passage provided does not appear to be from Ian Fleming's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". It seems to be a different story or scene.

However, based on the original passage provided, I can still answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are likely to be in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation. Without any additional information or context, it seems unlikely that Bond would be able to escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors. The fact that Bond has been caught in Blofeld's trap and is now a prisoner adds to the suspense, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next.
