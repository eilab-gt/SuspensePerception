Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and there is no indication of any immediate escape plan, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape without some help or unexpected turn of events.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes Bond being captured and disarmed, with no clear way out or obvious chance of escape. The situation is intense and dire, with Bond's life potentially in danger. The use of short, punchy sentences and the focus on the immediacy of the situation creates a sense of urgency and tension, making it extremely suspenseful.
