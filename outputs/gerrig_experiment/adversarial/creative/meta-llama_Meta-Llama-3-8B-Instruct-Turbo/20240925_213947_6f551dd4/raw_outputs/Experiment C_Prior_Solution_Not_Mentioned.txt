**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond is a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the large and ugly man. Bond's arms are pinned by piano wire, and he is at the mercy of his captors. The situation seems grim, and it will likely take some clever thinking and resourcefulness for Bond to escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tension and suspense. Bond is trapped, and his captors are unsympathetic. The setting is dark and ominous, with the large bird crashing into the wall and the hall light revealing another gun pointing at Bond's chest. The use of descriptive language, such as "ugly man" and "large and very ugly man", adds to the sense of unease. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next. The passage is expertly crafted to build tension and keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
