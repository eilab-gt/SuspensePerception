Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is tied up in a chair with piano wire and surrounded by Blofeld's henchmen.

Answer to Question 2:
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful, with Bond being captured and held captive by Blofeld and his henchmen, and the tension builds as Bond tries to find a way to escape. The sudden appearance of the bird crashing into the window and the introduction of the second gun add to the suspense and create a sense of unease. The passage is well-written and effectively builds a sense of tension and suspense in the reader.
