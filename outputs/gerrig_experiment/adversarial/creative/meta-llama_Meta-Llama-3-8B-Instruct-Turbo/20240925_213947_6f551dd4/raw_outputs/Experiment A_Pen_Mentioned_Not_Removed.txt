Answering Question 1:

I would choose answer 1. Not very likely. Although Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, he is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and he has already been outmaneuvered by Le Chiffre's trap. The situation is precarious, and Bond's chances of escape seem slim at this point.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose answer 7. Extremely suspenseful. This passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of tension and urgency. The reader is aware of Bond's precarious situation and the danger he is in, and the author's use of vivid imagery and rapid-fire action sequences keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. The sudden twists and turns, such as the Corsican's swift and unexpected actions, add to the suspense and make the passage feel intensely thrilling.
