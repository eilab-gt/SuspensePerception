Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***: 1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being captured by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the large and ugly man. Bond is pinned down by piano wire and is unable to move. While Bond does manage to pull up the rug to distract Blofeld, it's unclear how he would be able to escape from his predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes Bond being captured and pinned down by Blofeld's henchmen, with no clear way for him to escape. The tension is heightened by the description of Bond's struggles and the ominous tone of Blofeld's dialogue. The unexpected twist of the bird crashing into the wall of glass adds to the suspense, making it a thrilling and engaging passage.
