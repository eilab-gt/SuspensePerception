Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and being held at gunpoint. He's being dragged down a passage, and his options for escape appear to be limited. Given these circumstances, it's unlikely that he will escape easily or without facing more danger.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is highly suspenseful because it describes Bond being overpowered and held captive by Le Chiffre's men. The tension is palpable as Bond is searched, disarmed, and dragged away. The reader is left wondering: How will Bond escape or fight back? Will Vesper be safe? The use of quick, action-packed sentences adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making this passage very suspenseful.
