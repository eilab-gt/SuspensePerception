Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

Although Bond is able to use his agility and quick thinking to dodge the attack and retrieve his fountain pen, he is still a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has managed to temporarily escape from the Corsican, but he is still being pursued by the other two men. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without further action or help.
