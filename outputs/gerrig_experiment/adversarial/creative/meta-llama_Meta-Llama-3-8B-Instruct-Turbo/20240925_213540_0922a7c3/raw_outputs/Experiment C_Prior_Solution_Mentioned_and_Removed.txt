Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, with no clear opportunity to escape. Blofeld also has a plan to eliminate Bond, and Crushak is devoted to making it happen. The situation looks quite dire for Bond, making it unlikely that he will escape.

Answer to Question 2:
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and high-stakes situation where Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what kind of obstacles he will face. The added element of Blofeld's orders to kill Bond if he tries to speak, and the large, ugly man's presence, adds to the sense of danger and tension. The sudden arrival of the large bird and the subsequent struggle creates a sense of chaos and unpredictability, making the passage very suspenseful.
