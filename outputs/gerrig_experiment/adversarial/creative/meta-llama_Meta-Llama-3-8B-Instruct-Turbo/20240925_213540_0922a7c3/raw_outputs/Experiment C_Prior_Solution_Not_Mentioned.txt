Answering Question 1: I would choose option 1, "Not very likely", as Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the ugly man. He is physically restrained and has no obvious means of escape.

Answering Question 2: I would choose option 7, "Extremely suspenseful", as the passage is filled with twists and turns, with Bond's situation becoming increasingly dire. The unexpected events, such as the bird crashing into the wall and the revelation of the gun pointing at Bond's chest, keep the reader on the edge of their seat, eager to know what will happen next. The tense and foreboding atmosphere, as well as the sense of danger and captivity, contribute to the high level of suspense.
