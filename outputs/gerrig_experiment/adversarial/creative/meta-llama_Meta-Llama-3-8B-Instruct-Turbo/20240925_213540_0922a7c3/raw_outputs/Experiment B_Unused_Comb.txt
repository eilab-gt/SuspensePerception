Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, as they have him prisoner and have already taken away his gun and searched him for other weaponry. Bond's attempts to resist and fight back have been unsuccessful, and he appears to be at the mercy of his captors.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, and that his situation is precarious. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "Bond felt puny and impotent" and "Bond looked in the mirror of his hotel room to make certain that his black tie was centered in his collar", adds to the sense of suspense and creates a sense of intimacy with Bond's thoughts and feelings. The fact that Bond has been defeated and is at the mercy of his enemies adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive.
