***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose answer 1: Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, and there doesn't seem to be any clear opportunity for them to escape. Blofeld has successfully trapped them, and it's unclear how they will be able to get out of this situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with a captive character (Riley) being tortured and threatened, and a sinister and ruthless villain (Blofeld) in control. The reader is left with a sense of uncertainty and fear for the characters' fates, making it a very suspenseful passage.
