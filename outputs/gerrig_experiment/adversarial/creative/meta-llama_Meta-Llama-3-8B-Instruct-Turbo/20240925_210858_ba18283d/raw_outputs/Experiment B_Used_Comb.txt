Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond as being trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, with no clear indication of an immediate escape plan. Additionally, Bond is described as feeling "puny and impotent", suggesting that his situation is quite dire.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it sets up a tense and uncertain situation for the protagonist (Bond). The sudden and unexpected attack by the gunmen creates a sense of shock and alarm, and the description of Bond's feelings of powerlessness adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty about Bond's fate, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
