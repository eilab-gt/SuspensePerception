Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond and Vesper being prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, with no clear indication of how they will escape. The situation seems dire, with no obvious opportunity for Bond to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tension and suspense, with a sense of danger and uncertainty. The use of vivid language, such as "large bird crashing into the wall", "large and very ugly man", and "painfully into Alex's flesh" creates a sense of unease and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, making it extremely suspenseful.
