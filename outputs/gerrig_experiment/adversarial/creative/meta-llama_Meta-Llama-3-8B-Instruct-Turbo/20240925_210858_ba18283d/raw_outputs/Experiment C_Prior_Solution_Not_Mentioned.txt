**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, and there is no indication in this passage that they will escape easily or soon. Blofeld has laid a successful trap, and Bond and Vesper are at his mercy.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is highly suspenseful because it sets up a tense and precarious situation for the characters. The unexpected twist of the bird crashing into the glass wall creates a moment of surprise, and then Morgan's attempt to escape is thwarted by the large and ugly man. The passage also creates a sense of foreboding and menace, as Alex's words and actions suggest that he is capable of cruelty and will not hesitate to punish those who cross him. The use of vivid descriptions and the dark, ominous atmosphere adds to the sense of suspense and tension.
