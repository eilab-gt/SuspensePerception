Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a rather precarious situation, having been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He is outnumbered and outgunned, and the passage doesn't suggest any obvious means of escape or rescue. Therefore, it's unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.
