**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond being captured by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, and being thoroughly searched by them. Le Chiffre and Taylor seem to be in control, and Bond's ability to roll agilely and hide his fountain pen suggests that he is trying to conserve his resources for a potential escape attempt. However, the passage does not give a clear indication of how Bond will manage to escape, making it seem unlikely.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of action words like "hurled", "whistled", "slammed", and "crashed" creates a sense of intensity and chaos. The description of the Corsican's quick and delicate movements also adds to the tension, making the reader feel like Bond is in grave danger. The passage ends on a cliffhanger, with Bond being thoroughly searched and Le Chiffre urging his henchmen to "not waste time", leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
