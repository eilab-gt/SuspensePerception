I think there's been a mistake! The passage you provided doesn't match the one from Ian Fleming's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" that we were supposed to use to answer the questions.

However, I can still answer the questions based on the passage you provided.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I'll assume that Bond is not present in the passage, but rather Jordan is the character being trapped. Given the situation, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

It seems like Alex has Jordan pinned down, and Morgan is securing him with piano wire. It looks like a difficult situation for Jordan to escape from.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Based on the sudden introduction of a bird crashing into the wall, the darkness of the office, and the tension between Alex and Jordan, I would answer:

6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of surprise, uncertainty, and danger, making it a suspenseful read.
