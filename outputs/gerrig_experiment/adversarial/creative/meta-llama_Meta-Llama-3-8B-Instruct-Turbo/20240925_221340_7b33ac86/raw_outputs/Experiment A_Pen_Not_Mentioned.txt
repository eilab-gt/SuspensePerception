Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***: 1. Not very likely

Bond is already a prisoner, being held at gunpoint by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, and there is no indication of a clear plan for escape. It seems like a challenging situation for Bond to escape from.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is intense and dramatic, with Bond being held captive, the threat of violence, and the uncertainty of the situation. The use of phrases like "brusquely stripped", "unquiet chest", and "Let's not waste time" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
