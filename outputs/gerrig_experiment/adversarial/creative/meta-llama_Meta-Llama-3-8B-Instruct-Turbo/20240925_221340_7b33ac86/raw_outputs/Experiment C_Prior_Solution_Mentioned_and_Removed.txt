I think there's been a mistake! The passage provided is not from Ian Fleming's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", but rather from a different text. Therefore, I cannot accurately answer the questions based on the provided passage.

However, if you would like to provide the correct passage from "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", I'd be happy to help you answer the questions!
