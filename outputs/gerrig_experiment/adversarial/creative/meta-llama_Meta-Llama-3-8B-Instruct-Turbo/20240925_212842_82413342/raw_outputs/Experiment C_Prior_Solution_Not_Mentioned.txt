Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. The sudden and unexpected interruption by the bird, the use of darkness and lighting to create tension, and the threat of the large and ugly man, Mr. Cameron, all contribute to a sense of suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Drew (and potentially Bond) next, making it a very suspenseful passage.
