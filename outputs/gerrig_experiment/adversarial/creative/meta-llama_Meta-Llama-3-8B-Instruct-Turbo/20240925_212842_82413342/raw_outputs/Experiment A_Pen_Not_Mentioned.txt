Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"*** 1. Not very likely

Bond is already a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has just been disarmed and is being handled roughly. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"*** 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because Bond is in a vulnerable position, having just been caught by his enemies, and it's unclear what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions and the intensity of the situation create a sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen to Bond and Vesper.
