Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, with no obvious means of escape mentioned in the passage. Bond is likely to be in a difficult situation, and his chances of escape seem low.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and the situation is escalating with each new development. The use of a unexpected event (the bird crashing into the wall of glass) and the menacing tone of the characters creates a sense of uncertainty and fear, making the passage very suspenseful.
