Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

Given the current situation where Bond is being held by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Vesper is being led away, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

Bond is currently outnumbered and outgunned, and he's been disarmed. He's also just been caught by surprise, and it's unclear what his next move would be. The fact that Le Chiffre and his men are already in control, and Bond's plan to escape seems to have been foiled, suggests that his chances of escape are low.

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I would answer:

7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is incredibly suspenseful because it's clear that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the outcome is far from certain. The sudden twist where the Corsican shoots out Bond's shoe, and the rapid turn of events that follows, creates a sense of tension and unpredictability. The fact that Bond's plan to escape is foiled, and he's being held by Le Chiffre's men, adds to the sense of urgency and danger
