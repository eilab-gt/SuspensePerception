***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given the situation and the fact that Le Chiffre has successfully set a trap and Bond has been disarmed and caught, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as 2: Somewhat likely. 

While Bond's capture and disarmament put him at a disadvantage, Bond's previous quick thinking and actions in the passage (e.g., using the backward kick and attempting to move his fountain pen) indicate that he is resourceful and capable of taking action in difficult situations. Therefore, it is somewhat likely that he will find a way to escape, but it will likely require some creative and resourceful thinking.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would rate the passage as 6: Very suspenseful. The passage has a sense of urgency, danger, and tension. The reader is aware that Bond has been captured by a ruthless adversary, and Le Chiffre's sinister tone ("Come my dear friend, let's not waste time") suggests that something ominous is about to occur. Additionally, Bond's capture and the fact that his escape options seem limited creates a sense of urgency
