***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Given the information in the passage, I would choose answer 6. Very likely. James Bond is portrayed as a resourceful and skilled operative, and his actions suggest that he is planning to cause damage to his captors and possibly exchange information with Vesper. The fact that he managed to subtly move his fountain pen into his breast pocket, potentially hiding it from his captors, also indicates that he might have a plan for escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage describes a tense and violent confrontation between Bond and his captors, with Bond trying to cause damage and plan an escape. The use of vivid and dynamic language, such as "Like lightning", "shot out his left hand", "whistle of pain", and "crashed to the ground", creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will succeed in his plan, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
