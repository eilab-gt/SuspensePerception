Based on the passage provided, I must note that it does not match the description given at the beginning. The passage does not describe James Bond, Blofeld, or Vesper. It appears to be about someone named Alex and another character also named Alex. 

However, considering the passage and focusing on the character Alex, I will answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from captivity?"***
Based on the passage, I would choose option 5: Moderately likely. Alex has managed to outwit a guard before, but this time he is facing a different character, Jamie, who is described as very large and ugly, and has orders to shoot if Alex attempts to speak to him. The circumstances are not ideal for escape, but Alex has demonstrated resourcefulness in the past.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Alex facing danger and captivity. The presence of guns, violence, and the menacing character Jamie contributes to the suspense. The fact that Alex has a history of escaping captivity and is now in a precarious situation raises questions about his chances of survival
