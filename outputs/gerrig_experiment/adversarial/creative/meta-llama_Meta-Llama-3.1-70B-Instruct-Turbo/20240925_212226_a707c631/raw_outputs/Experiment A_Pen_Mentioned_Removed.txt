Although the original passage provided initially didn't contain these specific details, the additional passage offers some insight into Bond's predicament.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given the situation and the additional information provided, the answer would be: 
5. Moderately likely.

Bond appears to be resourceful and has already shown his willingness to take action (e.g., his initial kick at the gunman). Although the odds are against him at the moment, with Le Chiffre's men holding him captive and having confiscated his gun, Bond's agility and quick thinking (as seen when he moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket) suggest that he might still have an opportunity to escape or create a distraction.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The answer would be: 
6. Very suspenseful.

The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond in a precarious situation and the threat of physical harm or worse hanging over him. The speed and violence of the action, combined with the deliberate and calculated movements of the antagonists, all contribute to a highly suspenseful scene.
