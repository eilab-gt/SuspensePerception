The passage you provided does not match the one described at the beginning of the question. The passage seems to be from a different story and features characters named Jordan and Drew, rather than James Bond and Blofeld.

However, I will answer the questions based on the original passage described.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent and has a history of escaping from difficult situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension by describing Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, which puts the reader in a state of anticipation and concern for the characters' safety.
