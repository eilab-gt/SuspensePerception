The passage provided does not match the original passage mentioned. It appears to be a different story with characters named Riley. 

However, I will answer the questions based on the first passage mentioned.

Answer 1: Considering Bond's skills and experience, and the fact that this is a spy novel, I would say the likelihood of Bond escaping is high. Therefore, my answer is: 6. Very likely.

Answer 2: The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond and Vesper as prisoners, which creates suspense. However, it's a brief excerpt and doesn't provide many details about the situation, so the suspense level might not be extremely high. My answer is: 5. Moderately suspenseful.
