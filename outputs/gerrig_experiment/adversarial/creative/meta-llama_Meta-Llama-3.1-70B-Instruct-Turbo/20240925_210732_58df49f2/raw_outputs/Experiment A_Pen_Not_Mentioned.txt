***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the given passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 4 (Neutral or Uncertain). Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in attempting to rescue Vesper and trying to take down the gunmen, the odds are currently stacked against him. He is outnumbered, outgunned, and his plan has been foiled. However, considering Bond's character and the context of the novel, it is difficult to say for certain that he will not find a way to escape.
