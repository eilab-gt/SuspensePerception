This text is from a different passage and story than the original. 

However, I will still answer the questions based on this new passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Alex will escape from Jordan?"***

Considering the situation, I would say: 5. Moderately likely. The passage suggests that Alex has outwitted Jordan's guards in the past, indicating that Alex has some ability to escape or manipulate his captors. However, the current situation seems bleak, with Alex being tied to a chair and guarded by a menacing individual.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would say: 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, including the bird crashing into the glass, the gunfight, and the brutal treatment of Alex by Jordan's guard. The fact that Alex's previous escape attempt led to the death of Jordan's guard adds to the stakes, making it clear that the consequences of failure will be dire. The passage effectively builds tension and creates a sense of urgency, making it extremely suspenseful.
