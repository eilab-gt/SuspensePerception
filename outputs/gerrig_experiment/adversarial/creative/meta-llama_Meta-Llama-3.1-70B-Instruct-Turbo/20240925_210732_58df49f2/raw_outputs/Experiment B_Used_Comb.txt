Although the provided text for answering the questions appears to be about Jordan, not James Bond or Le Chiffre, it can still be used to make an educated guess.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond (or Jordan) will escape from Le Chiffre (or Alex)?"***
I would choose option 5. Moderately likely

The passage suggests that Jordan is a skilled and agile person, which increases the likelihood of his escape. However, it also shows that he is currently trapped and at the mercy of Alex and his assistants.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage has all the elements of suspense: a surprise attack, a hero who is skilled but currently helpless, and a villain who seems to be in control. The detailed description of the action and the attention to the hero's emotions also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
