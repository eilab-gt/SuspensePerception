This new passage doesn't match the original excerpt provided, but based on the new passage I will answer the questions:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Riley will escape from Alex?"**
6. Very likely

This answer is based on the character's previous success in escaping, although it's now uncertain as Alex has taken measures to prevent it, assigning a new, devoted guard, and explicitly stating that the guard has orders to shoot Riley if he tries to speak or escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage creates suspense by putting the main character, Riley, in a precarious situation, as he is held captive and being threatened by the villain Alex, and a devoted, potentially brutal guard. The previous failed escape attempt also adds tension, and the present situation seems even more dire, making it suspenseful.
