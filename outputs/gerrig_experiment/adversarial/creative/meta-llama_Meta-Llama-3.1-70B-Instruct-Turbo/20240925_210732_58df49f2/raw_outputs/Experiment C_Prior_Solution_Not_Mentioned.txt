It seems like there's been an error in the text provided. The passage seems to be from a different story and not 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. However, based on the original prompt, I will answer the questions using the initial passage provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 5. Moderately likely. James Bond is a skilled spy and has managed to get out of difficult situations in the past, but at this point, he and Vesper are trapped by Blofeld and his two gunmen, which makes the situation challenging. Still, given Bond's abilities, there is a moderate chance he might find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates a tense atmosphere by describing Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld, and there is an inherent risk of danger associated with being held captive by a powerful and ruthless adversary. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, making the passage very suspenseful.
