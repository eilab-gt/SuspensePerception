I will only be answering based on the first passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 7: Extremely likely. James Bond is the protagonist of the novel, and it's typical for protagonists in action novels to find a way to escape from danger. Additionally, James Bond is portrayed as a skilled and resourceful agent.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension by describing Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Le Chiffre, a criminal with two gunmen, and implies that they are in grave danger. This cliffhanger-like situation creates suspense and anticipation for the reader to find out what happens next.
