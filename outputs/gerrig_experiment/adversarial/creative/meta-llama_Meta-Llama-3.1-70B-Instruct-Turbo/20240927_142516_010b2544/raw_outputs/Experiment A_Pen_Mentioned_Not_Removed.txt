I'll answer the questions based on the original passage provided, without considering the additional text.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the situation, Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which puts him at a disadvantage. However, James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character. Given his profession and abilities, I would rate the likelihood of his escape as follows: 

5. Moderately likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage sets a tense atmosphere, with Bond and Vesper being taken captive by Le Chiffre's men. The situation is precarious, and the reader can sense the danger Bond is in. The fact that Bond has already achieved his initial goal of causing Le Chiffre financial losses but is now in a vulnerable position adds to the tension. I would rate the suspense level as follows: 

6. Very suspenseful
