***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4, Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a situation where Bond is at a disadvantage, as a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. However, it also describes Bond as having "suddenly decided" and mentions his plan to "do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen." This suggests that Bond is resourceful and determined, which leaves open the possibility of escape. However, the passage does not provide enough information to make a definitive assessment of the likelihood of Bond's escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6, Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension by describing Bond's capture and his precarious situation as a prisoner. The presence of guns and the rough treatment of Bond by the gunmen contribute to a sense of danger and urgency. The fact that Bond is planning to take action and "do as much damage as possible" adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape.
