The provided passage does not relate to the original context. It seems to be an unrelated excerpt. 

However, I will answer the questions based on the initial passage about Ian Fleming's novel 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given the context, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld is Moderate (Option 5: Moderately likely). As Bond is a skilled secret agent, it's likely that he will find a way to escape. However, the fact that Blofeld has laid a successful trap and Bond is currently a prisoner suggests that it might not be an easy escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level as Extremely suspenseful (Option 7: Extremely suspenseful). The passage creates tension by setting up a situation where the protagonist, Bond, is in danger, and his fate is uncertain. The fact that he has been captured by the villain, Blofeld, and is at their mercy creates a high level of suspense and anticipation for what will happen next.
