***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would rate this a 7: Extremely likely. 

This is because James Bond is the protagonist of the novel, and it's typical for the main character in a story to escape from a difficult situation and continue the plot. Bond is also portrayed as a skilled and resourceful character, so it's likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre's trap.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would rate this a 7: Extremely suspenseful. 

The passage creates tension and suspense by describing Bond's situation as precarious, with Le Chiffre's gunmen holding him captive and seemingly having the upper hand. The mention of Bond's "unquiet chest" and the gunmen's rough handling of him also contribute to the sense of danger and urgency, making the reader wonder what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape.
