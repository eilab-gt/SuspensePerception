***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given the situation, with Bond being a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, it might seem unlikely that Bond will escape. However, Bond is portrayed as a resourceful and determined character. He is also attempting to do as much damage as possible and has managed to subtly move his fountain pen to a more secure location, indicating he might be planning something. Considering Bond's character and these hints of planning, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as 'Moderately likely' (option 5).

Additionally, there are hints that Bond might be planning an escape, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The passage effectively conveys the danger and urgency of the situation, making the reader invested in the outcome. I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 'Very suspenseful' (option 6).
