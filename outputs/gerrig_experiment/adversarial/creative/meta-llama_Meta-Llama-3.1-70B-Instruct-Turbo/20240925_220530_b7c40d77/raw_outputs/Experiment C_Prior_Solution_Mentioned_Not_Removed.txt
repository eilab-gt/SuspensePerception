Based on the provided information about James Bond and the passage, I will answer the questions:

However, the passage you provided is not relevant to the James Bond excerpt. It seems like an unrelated story about Taylor being held captive by Jordan. 

Assuming you want me to answer the questions based on the James Bond excerpt, here are my answers:

1. Since the passage is from an Ian Fleming James Bond novel, where Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape difficult situations, and considering that no information is provided in the passage about the specific circumstances of Bond's captivity, I will choose: 
6. Very likely

2. The passage sets up a situation where the main character, Bond, is in a precarious situation, being held captive by a villain with two gunmen. This creates tension and anticipation, which are key elements of suspense. Therefore, I find the passage:
7. Extremely suspenseful
