Based on the initial passage provided about James Bond and not the additional passage, I'll answer the questions:

Answer to Question 1: 
I would choose option 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently trapped, he is a skilled spy, and his ability to outmaneuver and escape his captors is a key part of the James Bond character.

Answer to Question 2: 
I would choose option 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates tension by revealing that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld, which puts them in a precarious and life-threatening situation, leaving the reader wondering how they will manage to escape.
