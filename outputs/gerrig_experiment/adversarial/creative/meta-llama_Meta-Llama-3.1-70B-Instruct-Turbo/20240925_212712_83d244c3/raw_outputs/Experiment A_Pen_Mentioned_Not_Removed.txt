The new excerpt was provided but not used in the original prompt, however based on the original passage for answering the two questions and new excerpt, however, the answer can also align with the additional information.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given that Bond is a skilled secret agent and has shown quick reflexes in the new excerpt, and that he moved his fountain pen (which may potentially be used for escape) deeper into his breast pocket without being noticed, the likelihood of Bond escaping increases. Therefore, I would rate it as 6. Very likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite suspenseful because it sets up a situation where Bond and Vesper are in danger and Le Chiffre's intentions are malicious. The sudden action in the new excerpt where Bond attempts to intervene and is quickly caught also heightens the tension. Therefore, I would rate it as 7. Extremely suspenseful.
