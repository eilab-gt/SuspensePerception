***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
 
The correct answer would be 6. Very likely. James Bond is the main protagonist of the story and it would be unlikely for the main character to be defeated or held captive permanently, especially in the early part of the novel. Additionally, Bond has already demonstrated his resourcefulness and quick thinking by attempting to rescue Vesper and doing damage to the two gunmen.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The correct answer would be 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tense moments, with Bond attempting to escape and being thwarted, and the added element of Vesper being led away creates a sense of urgency. The detailed descriptions of the action and the quick thinking and agility of Bond also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. The ominous presence of Le Chiffre and his henchmen also raises the stakes, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
