***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Considering James Bond is the protagonist and a skilled secret agent, and given the typical formula of spy novels, it is reasonable to expect that Bond will find a way to escape or be rescued. Therefore, I would answer: 6. Very likely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Given the information provided, Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. This creates tension and raises concerns about their safety and potential rescue or escape. The fact that Blofeld has successfully laid a trap for Bond suggests that the villain is formidable, adding to the suspense. I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful.
