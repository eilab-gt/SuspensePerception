It appears the passage was altered and does not match the initial description of the excerpt from 'Casino Royale'. The passage now seems to be a rewritten and altered scene with incorrect character names (Riley instead of Bond and Le Chiffre). However, I will attempt to answer the questions based on the altered passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond (Riley) will escape from Le Chiffre (Riley's opponent)?"***

Considering the rewritten passage, I would say that option 5. Moderately likely is the most fitting. Although the character (Riley) initially puts up a good fight, he is eventually subdued and trapped. However, given the character's demonstrated agility and resourcefulness, it's possible that he may still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the passage as 6. Very suspenseful. The sudden and unexpected turn of events, the character's (Riley) initial bravery and quick thinking, and the dramatic turn of the tables with him being trapped, create a high level of tension and suspense.
