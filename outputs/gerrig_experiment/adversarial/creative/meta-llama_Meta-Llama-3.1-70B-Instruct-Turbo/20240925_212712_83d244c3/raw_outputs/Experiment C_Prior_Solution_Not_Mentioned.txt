I think there's been a mistake. The passage provided appears to be from a different story, not Ian Fleming's 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. However, I will answer the questions based on this passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Drew will escape from Jordan and Cameron?"***
Given the situation, I would say the answer is: 3. Slightly likely

Drew managed to create a distraction and temporarily gain the upper hand, but ultimately, he was caught and tied up by Cameron. He is now at the mercy of his captors, which makes it less likely for him to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would say the answer is: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tense moments, from the bird crashing into the glass wall to Drew's attempted escape and his subsequent capture. The fact that Drew is now tied up and at the mercy of Jordan and Cameron creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
