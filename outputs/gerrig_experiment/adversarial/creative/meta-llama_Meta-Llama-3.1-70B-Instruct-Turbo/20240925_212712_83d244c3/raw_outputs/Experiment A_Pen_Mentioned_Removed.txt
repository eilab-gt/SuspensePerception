Based on the additional excerpt, I will answer the questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering Bond's predicament, I would say that it is 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently at a disadvantage, being a prisoner of Le Chiffre, his actions and decisions suggest that he is resourceful and determined. The fact that he attempted to attack the gunmen and managed to move his fountain pen (which may be a potential tool for escape) into a more secure position, shows that he is already planning his next move.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the passage, I would say that it is 7. Extremely suspenseful. The scene is tense and action-packed, with Bond trying to escape and the gunmen responding with force. The fact that Bond's plan is to do as much damage as possible and try to communicate with Vesper adds to the sense of urgency. Additionally, the reader is aware that Le Chiffre has successfully trapped Bond and Vesper, making the situation seem hopeless, which heightens the suspense.
