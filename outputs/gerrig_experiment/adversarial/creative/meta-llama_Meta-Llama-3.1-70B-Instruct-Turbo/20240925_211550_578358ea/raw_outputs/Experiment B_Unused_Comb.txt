It appears that the provided text is not the actual excerpt from Ian Fleming's 'Casino Royale', but rather a passage with similar themes and character names replaced with 'Riley'. 

However, I will answer the questions based on the information provided in the original prompt.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character who often finds ways to escape difficult situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage effectively creates tension and suspense as Bond and Vesper are captured by Le Chiffre and his men, setting the stage for a dramatic and intense confrontation.
