It appears you've included a different passage for the questions, but I'll answer them based on the original passage you provided:

 ***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
My answer is: 6. Very likely

As this is a James Bond novel, it's expected that Bond will find a way to escape and ultimately triumph over the villain, despite the current predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
My answer is: 5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage creates tension by putting Bond and Vesper in a perilous situation as prisoners of Blofeld. However, since we don't have more context about the situation and the passage is quite brief, it's not extremely suspenseful. The suspense level is moderate, as we expect Bond to find a way out, but the specifics of how he will escape are unknown.
