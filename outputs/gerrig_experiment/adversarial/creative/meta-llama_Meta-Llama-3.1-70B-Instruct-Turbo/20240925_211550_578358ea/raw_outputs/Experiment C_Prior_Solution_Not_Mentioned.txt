The passage provided does not match the initial description. The passage seems to be from a different story with characters Jordan, Drew, and Cameron, rather than James Bond, Blofeld, and Vesper.

However, I will provide answers based on the initial description provided at the beginning.

1. ***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Answer: 5. Moderately likely

James Bond is a skilled and resourceful secret agent. Given his background and expertise, it's reasonable to assume he has a decent chance of escaping from Blofeld, despite being a prisoner.

2. ***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates tension by mentioning that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, implying they are in a life-threatening situation. This setup creates suspense, as the reader wonders how Bond will escape and what consequences might arise from this predicament.
