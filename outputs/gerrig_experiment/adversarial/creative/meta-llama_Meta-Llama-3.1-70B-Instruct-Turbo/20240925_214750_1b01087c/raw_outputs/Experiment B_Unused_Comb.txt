**Answer to Question 1:**
Given the information from the passage, I would say that it is "4. Neutral or Uncertain" that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Although Bond has shown some quick reflexes and self-defense skills in the past, the current situation shows him as being overpowered and trapped by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, making his chances of escape uncertain.

**Answer to Question 2:**
I would rate the passage as "7. Extremely suspenseful". The scene unfolds with a sudden and intense turn of events, from Bond's confident preparations for a dinner date to the violent and unexpected invasion of his hotel room by Le Chiffre and his men. The passage effectively builds tension as Bond is overpowered, disarmed, and left feeling "puny and impotent", leaving the reader with a sense of uncertainty and concern for Bond's well-being.
