***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 5: Moderately likely. Given the context of the passage and the series of James Bond novels, Bond is known for his resourcefulness and cunning. Despite being caught and disarmed, Bond has managed to create some chaos and it's possible he might find another opportunity to escape or outsmart his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension, with Bond trying to create an opportunity to escape and Le Chiffre's assistant catching him off guard. The use of phrases like "Like lightning" and "very quickly" emphasizes the rapid and intense action taking place, while the capture and disarming of Bond raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
