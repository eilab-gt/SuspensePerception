Based on the passage provided (which is actually from the first book 'Diamonds are Forever', but it is not from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'):

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage presents a situation where Bond is in a difficult position, with his arms tied up with piano wire and a guard with orders to shoot him if he tries to speak, this is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from such situations. 

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because Bond's situation appears dire, with a man with a gun watching him closely and orders to shoot if Bond attempts to speak. This creates tension and raises questions about how Bond will manage to escape from this predicament.
