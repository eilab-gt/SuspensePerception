***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Given Bond's character as a skilled and resourceful spy, it's possible he will find a way to escape or at least put up a fight. However, the odds are against him at this point, so it's not extremely likely that he'll escape.

Additionally, the passage hints at Bond's plan to fight back and try to escape, which raises questions about whether he will succeed or not, keeping the reader engaged and suspense
