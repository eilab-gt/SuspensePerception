***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the passage, Bond has already shown some resourcefulness and athleticism by attempting to take down the gunmen, but ultimately being overpowered. However, it is a James Bond novel, and it's typical for the protagonist to face danger and find ways to escape or overcome adversity. Given the information provided and the genre of the novel, I would say the answer is: 

6. Very likely 

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

This passage creates a high level of tension as Bond is overpowered, disarmed, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The sudden turn of events and the physical struggle between Bond and the gunmen contribute to the suspense. The ending of the passage, where Le Chiffre addresses Bond with a sense of impending doom ("Come my dear friend. Let's not waste time"), further increases the suspense. I would rate the suspense level as: 

7. Extremely suspenseful
