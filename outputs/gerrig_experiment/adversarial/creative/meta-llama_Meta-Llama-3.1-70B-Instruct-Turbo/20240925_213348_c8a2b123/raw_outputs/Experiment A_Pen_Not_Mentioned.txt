Based on the provided passages, here are the answers to the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering that Bond has managed to catch the attention of Le Chiffre, shown his determination to resist and escape, and demonstrated his agility and fighting skills, the chances of his escape seem possible but still uncertain. He has also shown his intentions to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and exchange words with Vesper. Given these factors, the likelihood of his escape can be considered moderately high, but not extremely high as he is still outnumbered and at a disadvantage.

Answer: 6. Very likely
