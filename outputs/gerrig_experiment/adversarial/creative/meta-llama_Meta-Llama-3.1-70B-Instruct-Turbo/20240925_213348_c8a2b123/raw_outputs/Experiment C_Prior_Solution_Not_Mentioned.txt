Given the additional passage provided, I can make a more informed assessment.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage shows Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunman, Crushak, James Bond is a character known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations. Given his past experiences and the fact that he has managed to cause Blofeld financial losses, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape from his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a high level of tension and suspense by depicting Bond being held captive and threatened by Blofeld and his gunman. The use of vivid imagery, such as the bird crashing into the wall and the darkness of the office, adds to the sense of chaos and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is being held in a precarious position, with a gun pointing at his chest and piano wire biting into his flesh, raises the stakes and creates a sense of urgency, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
