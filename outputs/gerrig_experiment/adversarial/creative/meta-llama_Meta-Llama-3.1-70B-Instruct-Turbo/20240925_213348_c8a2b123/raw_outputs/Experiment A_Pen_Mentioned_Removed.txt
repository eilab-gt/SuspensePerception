Based on the passage, I'll answer the questions:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Although Bond is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the passage shows Bond's resourcefulness and quick thinking. He attempts to escape, tries to create an opportunity to exchange words with Vesper, and even manages to conceal his fountain pen, which might be useful for a future escape plan. Given these factors, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as follows:

Answer: 6. Very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is full of action, tension, and suspense. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The fact that Le Chiffre and his men are actively working to subdue and disarm Bond adds to the tension. The passage's use of phrases like "Like lightning," "whistled past his hip," and "snatched away" creates a sense of urgency and rapid action, contributing to the suspense. 

Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful
