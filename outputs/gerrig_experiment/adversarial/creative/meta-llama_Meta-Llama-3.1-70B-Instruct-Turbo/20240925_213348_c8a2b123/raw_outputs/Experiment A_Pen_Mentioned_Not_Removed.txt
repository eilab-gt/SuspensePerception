***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

The passage suggests that James Bond is a resourceful and agile individual, as seen in his attempt to attack the gunmen and his ability to minimize damage when thrown to the ground. He also manages to secretly move his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, which may indicate that he has a plan or a potential tool for escape. While Bond is currently in a precarious situation, his actions suggest that he is actively trying to escape and may have a chance of success.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful due to the tense situation Bond is in, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of action-packed and descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall", creates a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is trying to escape and Vesper is being led away adds to the sense of tension and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
