***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Given that Bond has successfully managed to create some distractions and has a track record of escaping from captivity in the past, I would rate the likelihood of his escape as: 
5. Moderately likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite suspenseful due to the tense situation, the use of distractions (like the bird crashing into the wall), and the fact that Bond has a history of escaping. However, since Bond is currently tied up, the suspense level isn't the highest possible. I would rate the passage as: 
6. Very suspenseful
