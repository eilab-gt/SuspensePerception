***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would choose 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre and is currently being held by two gunmen, the passage also shows Bond's quick thinking and resourcefulness in trying to take action (e.g., kicking the thin man and attempting to move his fountain pen to a safer position). These actions suggest that Bond is already planning his escape and is not one to give up easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere by describing the precarious situation Bond is in, with Le Chiffre and his two gunmen controlling the situation. The reader is aware that Bond is in grave danger, and the passage's fast-paced action and short sentences add to the sense of urgency and suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being disarmed and is seemingly out of options heightens the tension and suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
