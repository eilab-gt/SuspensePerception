***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the given passage, I would answer: 6. Very likely

This conclusion is drawn from Bond's skills and agility shown in the passage, such as his quick decision to try and cause damage to the gunmen and his ability to minimize damage to himself when brought down to the ground. Additionally, the passage does not convey a sense of hopelessness or inevitability, which would suggest that escape is unlikely.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Based on the given passage, I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage has a fast-paced and intense action sequence that builds tension and suspense. The reader is presented with a high-stakes situation where Bond is in danger, and his ability to escape or counterattack is uncertain. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as 'Like lightning', 'whistle of pain', 'spidery summons', and 'agilely', adds to the sense of urgency and tension, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
