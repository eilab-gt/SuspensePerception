**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is a prisoner and Le Chiffre's men have taken his gun, the passage suggests that Bond is not easily subdued and has already tried to escape, demonstrating his quick thinking and agility. The text also implies that Bond has a plan to create chaos and potentially exchange words with Vesper, which could lead to a chance for escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is filled with action, tension, and a sense of urgency, creating a high level of suspense. Bond's attempted escape, Le Chiffre's sinister presence, and Vesper's unknown fate all contribute to a sense of unease and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The use of vivid and dynamic language, such as "whistled past his hip" and "crashed to the ground," adds to the sense of intensity and suspense.
