Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely. 

Although Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, Bond has already demonstrated his resourcefulness and agility in the passage. He is able to think and react quickly, as shown by his attempt to defend himself against the gunmen. However, he is currently outmatched and outnumbered, so his chances of escape are not extremely high. 

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful. 

The passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond facing a desperate situation. The use of vivid and dynamic language, such as "He crashed to the ground", "barked Le Chiffre", and "They twisted him around in search of other weaponry" adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape his predicament, which heightens the suspense.
