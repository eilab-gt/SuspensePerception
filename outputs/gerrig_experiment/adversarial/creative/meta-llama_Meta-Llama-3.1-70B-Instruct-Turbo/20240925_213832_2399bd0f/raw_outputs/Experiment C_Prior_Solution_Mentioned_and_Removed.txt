***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose 6. Very likely. The passage suggests that Bond is already planning and trying to escape, and his quick thinking has allowed him to momentarily gain an advantage. Given Bond's past success in outwitting his captors, it's likely he will find a way to escape again.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being held captive by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The sudden distraction of a bird crashing into the window and Bond's quick thinking add to the sense of urgency and unpredictability. The physical threat to Bond's life and his precarious situation create a sense of suspense that keeps the reader engaged and wondering what will happen next.
