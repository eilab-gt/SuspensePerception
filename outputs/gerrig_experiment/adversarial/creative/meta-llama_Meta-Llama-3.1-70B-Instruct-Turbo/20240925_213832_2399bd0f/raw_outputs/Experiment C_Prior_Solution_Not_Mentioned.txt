***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, it appears that Bond is in a precarious situation. He is tied up with piano wire and at the mercy of Blofeld and his two henchmen. However, Bond has managed to pull up a corner of the rug, which might indicate an attempt to create an opportunity for escape. Given Bond's resourcefulness in the past and his determination, it's unlikely that he would give up easily. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as "Moderately likely" (option 5).

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is quite suspenseful, as it sets up a tense and ominous situation for Bond. He's trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld, with guns pointed at him. The presence of henchmen, the use of piano wire to restrain Bond, and the ominous tone of Blofeld's words all contribute to a sense of tension and foreboding. The sudden interruption by a bird crashing into the wall and the reveal of another gun pointing at Bond's chest add to the suspense. I would rate the suspense level of this passage
