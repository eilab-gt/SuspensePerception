Based on the passage provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently being held captive, the passage suggests that he is resourceful, quick-thinking, and has already managed to avoid giving up his fountain pen, which could potentially be a useful tool in his escape. Additionally, Bond has a plan to "do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen" and exchange words with Vesper, indicating that he is thinking strategically about his situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Bond's attempted escape, the quick thinking and action of the Corsican gunman, and the ominous tone of Le Chiffre's dialogue. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not, creating a high level of suspense.
