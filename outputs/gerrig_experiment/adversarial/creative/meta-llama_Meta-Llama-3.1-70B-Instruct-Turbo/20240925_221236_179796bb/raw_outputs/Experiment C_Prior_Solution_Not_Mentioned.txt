It seems there is an unrelated passage provided. I will still answer the questions based on the original passage about James Bond.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given James Bond's character as a resourceful and skilled spy, I would say that it is 6. Very likely that he will escape from Blofeld. However, the situation seems dire, so I wouldn't go as far as "Extremely likely".

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

This passage is quite suspenseful as Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The fact that Bond's mission to ruin Blofeld has led to this outcome adds to the tension. Therefore, I would rate the passage as 6. Very suspenseful.
