The passage provided does not seem to match the original prompt, but rather appears to be a continuation or unrelated scene. However, I will answer the questions based on the initial passage from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would rate this as: 6. Very likely

As a James Bond novel, it's typical for the protagonist to find a way out of such predicaments, often through his skills and cunning.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate this as: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a tense situation, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. This puts the protagonist in a vulnerable position, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next and how Bond will manage to escape.
