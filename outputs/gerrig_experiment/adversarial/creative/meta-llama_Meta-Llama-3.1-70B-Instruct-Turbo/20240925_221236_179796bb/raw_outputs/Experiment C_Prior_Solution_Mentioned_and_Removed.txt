It appears you've provided a different passage for the questions. Since I need to answer the original questions based on the initial passage from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', I'll proceed accordingly.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his resourcefulness and cunning. Although he is currently a prisoner, it's likely that he will find a way to escape. 

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense atmosphere by describing Bond and Vesper as prisoners of Blofeld, with two gunmen holding them captive. The fact that Blofeld has successfully laid a trap for Bond adds to the sense of danger and raises questions about how Bond will manage to escape, making the passage suspenseful.
