***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Very likely". Although the passage portrays Bond in a precarious situation, given that it is a James Bond novel, it is highly likely that Bond will find a way to escape from his captors. This is a typical plot development in Bond stories, where Bond faces danger but ultimately manages to outsmart and outmaneuver his adversaries.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of the passage as "Very suspenseful" (6) or possibly even "Extremely suspenseful" (7). The passage effectively creates tension by describing the precarious situation Bond is in, being held captive by Le Chiffre's men, and the uncertainty surrounding his and Vesper's fate. The use of vivid language, such as the description of the "wikFHF, spidery summons" and the "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest," adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
