 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld. However, considering Bond's history in the series, it is plausible to assume that he has a decent chance of finding a way out of this situation. Therefore, I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Answer Question 2: The suspense in this passage primarily comes from the fact that Bond and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld, and their fate remains uncertain. The tension is further heightened by the description of Blofeld's cunning and successful trap. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
