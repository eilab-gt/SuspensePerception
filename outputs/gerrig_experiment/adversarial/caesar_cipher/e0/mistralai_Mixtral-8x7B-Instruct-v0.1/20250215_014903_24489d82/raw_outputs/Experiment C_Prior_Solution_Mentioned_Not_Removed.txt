 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a challenging situation, being the prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, there's a possibility that he might find a way to escape. A moderate level of likelihood seems appropriate here, so I would choose option 5, "Moderately likely".

Answer Question 2: The passage does build up some suspense as it describes a critical situation for the main character, Bond. However, without knowing the immediate consequences of this situation or how it will develop, it's hard to judge the level of suspense accurately. Based on the information given, I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".
