 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, Bond and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld and his gunmen. There is no mention of any immediate plans for Bond to escape, or any weaknesses in Blofeld's operation that might suggest an easy escape for Bond. Therefore, it seems that Bond's escape is not likely in the immediate future. I would select option 1, "Not very likely."

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation in which Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Blofeld, a dangerous criminal figure. The stakes are high, and there is a sense of uncertainty about what will happen next. This level of tension and uncertainty can create a suspenseful atmosphere for the reader. Therefore, I would select option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
