Here are my answers based on the provided text:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

The text describes Bond as a prisoner in a dangerous situation. While he's resourceful and skilled, Le Chiffre has him trapped with gunmen.  It's not clear if Bond has any immediate plans or advantages, so "somewhat likely" seems most fitting.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage sets up a clear conflict and danger for Bond. We know he's in a vulnerable position, and Le Chiffre's actions are threatening.  There's a sense of anticipation about what will happen next, making it moderately suspenseful.
