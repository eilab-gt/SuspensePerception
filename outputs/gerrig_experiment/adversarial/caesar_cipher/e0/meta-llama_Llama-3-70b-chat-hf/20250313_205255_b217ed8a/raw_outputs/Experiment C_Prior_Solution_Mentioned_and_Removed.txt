***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's unlikely that Ian Fleming would let his protagonist be captured and defeated so easily. Bond has a reputation for escaping from tight spots, and it's likely that he will find a way to outsmart Blofeld and his henchmen.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. The description of the scene, including the details of Bond's surroundings and the dialogue between Blofeld and Bond, adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper next.
