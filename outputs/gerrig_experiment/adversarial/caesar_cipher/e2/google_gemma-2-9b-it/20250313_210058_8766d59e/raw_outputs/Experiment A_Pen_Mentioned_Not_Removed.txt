Here are my answers based on the provided text:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

The passage describes Bond as a prisoner in a dangerous situation.  While he's resourceful and skilled, Le Chiffre has set a trap and has the upper hand.  It's not clear if Bond has any immediate plans for escape, but his character suggests he won't go down without a fight.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage sets up a clear conflict and danger for Bond. We know he's trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, which creates tension. However, without more details about Bond's immediate situation or plans, the suspense isn't at its highest level.
