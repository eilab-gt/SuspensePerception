1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given James Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Bond has been in difficult situations before and has always managed to extricate himself. Additionally, the presence of Vesper might provide an additional motivational factor for Bond to orchestrate an escape.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it sets up a high-stakes situation where Bond and Vesper are in the hands of a dangerous adversary. The text hints at the imminent threat and the potential for violence or torture, which creates tension and a sense of urgency for the reader. The fact that Bond has been captured despite his mission success adds to the suspense, as it is uncertain how he will manage to turn the tables on Le Chiffre.
