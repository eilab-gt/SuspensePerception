 Answer Question 1: 2. Somewhat likely
Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

Explanation:

Question 1: Although Bond has been captured, it is stated that Le Chiffre has laid a "successful trap" for Bond, implying that Le Chiffre might underestimate Bond's abilities and not finish him off immediately. Additionally, Bond is described as a skilled and resourceful agent, which might allow him to find a way to escape. However, there is no information in the passage about how Bond will escape or if he has any immediate plans to do so. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping is somewhat likely.

Question 2: The passage describes a dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond has been successful in causing Le Chiffre to lose a considerable amount of money, which has led to this situation. The tension and danger of the situation are heightened by the fact that Bond and Vesper are in a vulnerable position, and Le Chiffre has a personal grudge against Bond. Therefore, the passage is very suspenseful.
