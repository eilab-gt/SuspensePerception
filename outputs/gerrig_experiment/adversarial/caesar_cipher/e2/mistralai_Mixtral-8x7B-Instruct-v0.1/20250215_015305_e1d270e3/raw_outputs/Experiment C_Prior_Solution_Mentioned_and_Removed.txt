 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld. However, considering Bond's history in the series, it is plausible to assume that he has a chance of escaping. Therefore, I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Answer Question 2: The suspense in this passage is moderately high due to the uncertainty of Bond's fate. However, without knowing the full context of the scene, it is difficult to definitively say. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
