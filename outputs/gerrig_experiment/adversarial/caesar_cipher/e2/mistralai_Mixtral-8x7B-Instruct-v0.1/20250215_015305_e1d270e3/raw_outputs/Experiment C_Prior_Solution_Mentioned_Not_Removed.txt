 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being the prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and skills, it's plausible that he might find a way to escape. Given the limited context, I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Answer Question 2: The suspense in a narrative often depends on the reader's engagement and knowledge. While the passage does describe a tense situation, without knowing the outcome, it's hard to definitively assess the suspense. However, given that Bond is in a precarious position, there is an element of suspense. I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain". If I were to make an assumption based on the genre and character, I might choose option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
