 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being the prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, there's a chance he might escape. A moderate level of likelihood seems appropriate, so I would choose option 5, "Moderately likely".

Answer Question 2: The passage does build up some suspense as it describes a critical situation for the main character, Bond. However, without more context or dramatic events in this specific passage, I would rate the suspense as moderate. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
