Answer to Question 1: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond is in a precarious situation, being held prisoner by Blofeld and his gunmen, the narrative does not give any clear indication of the likelihood of his escape. Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping dangerous situations suggest that an escape is possible, but the current circumstances, including the presence of armed guards and the lack of any apparent means of escape, make it uncertain.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes involved and the uncertainty of Bond's fate. Bond and Vesper are in immediate danger, and the tension is heightened by the description of their capture and the ominous dialogue between Blofeld and his henchman, Fuxvkdn. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape this situation, if at all, which creates a strong sense of suspense.
