 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, Bond and Vesper have been captured by Blofeld and his gunmen, so it seems like they are in a difficult situation. However, since this is a work of fiction and Bond is the main character, there is a good chance he will find a way to escape. I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld. The stakes are high and the outcome is uncertain, which can make for a suspenseful reading experience. I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
