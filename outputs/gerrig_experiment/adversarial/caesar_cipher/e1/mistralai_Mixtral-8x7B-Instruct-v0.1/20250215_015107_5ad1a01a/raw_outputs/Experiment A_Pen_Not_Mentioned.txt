 Answer Question 1: 2. Somewhat likely
Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

Explanation:

Question 1: Although Bond has been captured, it is stated that Le Chiffre has laid a "successful trap" for Bond, implying that Le Chiffre might underestimate Bond's abilities and not finish him off immediately. Additionally, Bond's resourcefulness and determination to escape are well-established in the series, making it somewhat likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Question 2: The passage describes a dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, creating a sense of suspense. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, making the passage very suspenseful.
