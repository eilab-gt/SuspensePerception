 Answer Question 1: 2. Somewhat likely
Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

Explanation: Based on the passage, Bond and Vesper are currently the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, since this is a fictional story, there is a possibility that Bond might escape or find a way to overcome the situation. Given the context, it seems somewhat likely that Bond will escape, but it is also uncertain how he will manage to do so. Additionally, the suspenseful element comes from the danger that Bond is in, making the reader curious about how he will get out of this situation.
