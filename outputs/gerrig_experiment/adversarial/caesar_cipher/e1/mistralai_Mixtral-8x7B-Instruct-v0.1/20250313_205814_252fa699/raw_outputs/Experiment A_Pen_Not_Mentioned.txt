 Answer Question 1: 2. Somewhat likely
Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

Explanation:

Question 1: Based on the passage, Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre, so it seems unlikely that he will escape easily. However, considering Bond's skills and experience as a secret agent, it is plausible that he might find a way to escape, albeit with some difficulty. Hence, I have chosen option 2, "Somewhat likely."

Question 2: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. This creates a strong sense of suspense, as the reader is left wondering about the outcome of this situation. Therefore, I have chosen option 6, "Very suspenseful."
