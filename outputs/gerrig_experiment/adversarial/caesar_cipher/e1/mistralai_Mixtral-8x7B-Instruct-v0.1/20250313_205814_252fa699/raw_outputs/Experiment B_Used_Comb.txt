 Question 1: Based on the passage, it is not clear exactly how likely Bond is to escape from Le Chiffre, as more context would be needed to make an accurate assessment. However, given that Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape dangerous situations, one might assume that there is a moderate to high likelihood that he will find a way to escape. So, I would choose option 5, "Moderately likely," or option 6, "Very likely," depending on how optimistic one wants to be.

Question 2: The passage does contain a certain level of suspense, as Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, without knowing the specific details of their predicament or what happens next, it is difficult to say for sure how suspenseful the passage is. Based on the information provided, I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain,"
