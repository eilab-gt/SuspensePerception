1. Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
Given the context that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his gunmen, and considering Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from perilous situations, it is reasonable to assume that there is a good chance of Bond finding a way to escape. However, the exact likelihood cannot be determined without more information about the circumstances of their capture and the resources available to Bond. Therefore, a neutral or uncertain stance seems appropriate:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

2. Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
The passage describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are in the hands of the enemy, which is a classic setup for suspense. Readers are likely to be curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to outwit Blofeld.
