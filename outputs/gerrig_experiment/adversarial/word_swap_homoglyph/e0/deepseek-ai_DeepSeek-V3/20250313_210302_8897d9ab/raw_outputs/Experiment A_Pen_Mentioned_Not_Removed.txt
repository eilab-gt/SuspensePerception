1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under close surveillance by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His attempts to resist have been thwarted, and the situation appears dire, making escape seem "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the tension of Bond's capture, his failed attempt to fight back, and the looming threat from Le Chiffre and his men. The uncertainty of Bond's fate and the rapid action contribute to the suspense.
