Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently restrained and under guard, he has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations. His quick thinking with the rug and the bird distraction show he's still resourceful.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond is captured, threatened, and physically restrained. The introduction of the menacing Crushak and Blofeld's explicit instructions to shoot Bond on any attempt at communication heighten the suspense.
