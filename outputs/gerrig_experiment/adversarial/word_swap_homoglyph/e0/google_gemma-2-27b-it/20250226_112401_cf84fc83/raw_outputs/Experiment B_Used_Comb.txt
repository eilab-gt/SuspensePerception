Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The fact that he's described as feeling "puny and impotent" suggests a temporary setback rather than a guaranteed defeat.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, Bond's initial struggle, and his ultimate capture create a sense of danger and uncertainty. Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and the detail about the comb add to the tension, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
