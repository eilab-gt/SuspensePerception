Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld's introduction of Crushak, a seemingly brutal and dedicated enforcer, makes a clean escape seem less probable. However, Bond's history of cunning and resilience suggests he might still find a way out.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's explicit threat create a palpable sense of danger. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and the painful restraint add to the suspense.
