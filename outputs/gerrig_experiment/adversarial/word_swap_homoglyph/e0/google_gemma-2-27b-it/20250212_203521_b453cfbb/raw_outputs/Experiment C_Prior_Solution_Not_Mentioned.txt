Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control, and Crushak appears to be a formidable opponent.  Escape doesn't seem impossible, but it will be very difficult.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through several elements:

* **Bond's capture:** The initial capture and Blofeld's calm demeanor create tension.
* **The distraction:** The bird incident offers a brief glimmer of hope, raising the stakes when it fails.
* **Crushak's introduction:** The description of Crushak as "very large and very ugly" adds a sense of menace.
* **Bond's restraint:** The detailed description of Bond being tied up emphasizes his vulnerability.
* **Blofeld's threat:**  Blofeld's parting words leave the reader wondering what further danger awaits Bond.
