Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. The fact that Le Chiffre seems to anticipate Bond's moves suggests a difficult situation.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, there's a sense of urgency in his actions, and Le Chiffre's calm demeanor adds to the feeling that Bond is in serious danger. The description of the Corsican's quick and precise movements heightens the suspense.
