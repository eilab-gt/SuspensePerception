Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about Crushak's dedication to eliminating "irritations" suggests a formidable obstacle. However, Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations leaves room for hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's menacing tone all contribute to a sense of impending danger. The description of Crushak's "ugly" appearance and the painful tightening of the piano wire further heighten the suspense.
