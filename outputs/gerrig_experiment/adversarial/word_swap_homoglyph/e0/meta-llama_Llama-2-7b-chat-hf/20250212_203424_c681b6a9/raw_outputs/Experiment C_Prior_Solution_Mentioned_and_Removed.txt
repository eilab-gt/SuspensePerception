  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, the situation this time seems more dire, with Bond being tied up and surrounded by two gunmen. It's possible that Bond could find a way to escape, but it's also possible that he could be captured and held captive by Blofeld.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond being captured by Blofeld and his gunmen, and the use of descriptive language and the mention of the large bird crashing into the wall of glass creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage also hints at the possibility of Bond's capture and death, which adds to the suspense. Overall, the passage is quite suspenseful and keeps the reader engaged.
