  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, the situation this time seems more dire, with Bond being tied up and surrounded by Blofeld's gunmen. However, Bond is a resourceful and skilled agent, so it's possible that he could find a way to escape or outsmart his captors.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage sets up a tense and dangerous situation for Bond, with Blofeld's gunmen closing in on him and Bond unable to escape. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of tension create a sense of urgency and suspense, making it difficult to put the passage down.
