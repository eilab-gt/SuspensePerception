I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, he is still restrained by the piano wire and surrounded by Blofeld's gunmen. It is unclear how he will be able to escape from this situation.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. Bond is in a dangerous situation, trapped by Blofeld's gunmen and unable to escape. The use of descriptive language and the tension created by the situation make for a very suspenseful passage.
