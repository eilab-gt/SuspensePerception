***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been resourceful in the past, but he is currently in a precarious situation with Crushak guarding him and being tied up with piano wire. The outcome is uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes involved, the danger Bond is in, and the uncertainty of his fate. The sudden appearance of the bird, Bond's quick thinking, and the subsequent confrontation with Crushak all contribute to a sense of tension and suspense.
