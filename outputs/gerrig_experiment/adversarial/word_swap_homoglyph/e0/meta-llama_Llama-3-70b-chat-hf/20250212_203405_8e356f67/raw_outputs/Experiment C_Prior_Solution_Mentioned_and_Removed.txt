***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it's likely that the author will find a way for him to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of details like the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh and the threat of being shot if he speaks adds to the sense of suspense and raises the stakes for the protagonist.
