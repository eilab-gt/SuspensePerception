***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, this is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations. The fact that Bond was able to take advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall and momentarily gain the upper hand suggests that he is still resourceful and capable of finding ways to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The description of the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh and the ominous tone of Blofeld's dialogue create a sense of tension and danger. The fact that Bond is unable to escape at this moment and is left to "contemplate his rude behavior" creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about what will happen to him next, making the passage very suspenseful.
