I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and action-packed scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "slammed", "twisted", and "roughly" creates a sense of urgency and danger, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next.
