Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is facing a large and ugly gunman named Crushak. Blofeld has also made it clear that he intends to eliminate Bond, and Bond has no clear means of escape. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and he is facing a ruthless and cunning enemy. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" gunman, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
