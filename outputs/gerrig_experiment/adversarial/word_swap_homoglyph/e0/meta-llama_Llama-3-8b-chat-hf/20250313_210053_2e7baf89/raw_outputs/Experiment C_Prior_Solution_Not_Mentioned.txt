Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and others, and is being held captive in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and the chair's corners. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's capture and imprisonment by Blofeld, and the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape or what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful wrapping of piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the suspense and tension in the passage.
