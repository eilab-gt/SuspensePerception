Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by piano wire. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape from Blofeld's clutches. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" man, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the tension and suspense. The reader is also left wondering what will happen to Vesper, who is not mentioned in this passage but is likely to be a concern for Bond.
