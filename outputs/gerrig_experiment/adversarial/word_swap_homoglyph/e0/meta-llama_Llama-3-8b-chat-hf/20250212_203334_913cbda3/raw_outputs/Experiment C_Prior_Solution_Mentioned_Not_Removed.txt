Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has mentioned that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, implying that Bond is in grave danger. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is taunting him, implying that he will not be treated kindly. The description of Crushak's ugly face and his menacing behavior adds to the sense of unease. The use of vivid language, such as "the large bird crashed into the wall of glass", "the large and very ugly man", and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Bond's escape. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
