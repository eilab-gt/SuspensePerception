Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from this situation, especially since he is outnumbered and outgunned.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Bond is being disarmed and searched. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be harmed. The use of action and violence, such as the fight between Bond and the Corsican, adds to the suspense and creates a sense of tension.
