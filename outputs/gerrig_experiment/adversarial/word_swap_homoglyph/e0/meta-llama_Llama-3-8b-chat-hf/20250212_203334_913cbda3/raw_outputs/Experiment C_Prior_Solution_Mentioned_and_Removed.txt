Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him, which makes it even more unlikely that Bond will be able to escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the setting, including the dark office and the large and ugly Crushak, adds to the sense of foreboding. The fact that Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Bond if he tries to escape also creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
