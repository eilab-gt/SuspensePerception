Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is facing a large and ugly gunman named Crushak. Blofeld has also made it clear that he intends to eliminate Bond, so it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and he is facing a ruthless and powerful enemy. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" gunman, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape or survive his captivity.
