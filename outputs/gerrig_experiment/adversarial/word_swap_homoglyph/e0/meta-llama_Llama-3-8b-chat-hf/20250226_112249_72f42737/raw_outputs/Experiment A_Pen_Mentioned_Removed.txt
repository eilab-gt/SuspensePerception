Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed and is at their mercy. It's unlikely that he will escape without a plan or some kind of help.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond is in danger, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage", creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is also left wondering what Le Chiffre's intentions are, adding to the suspense.
