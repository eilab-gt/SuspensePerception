Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled. He managed to briefly overpower one of the gunmen and displayed agility in avoiding the Corsican's attack.  However, he's now disarmed and outnumbered, with Le Chiffre directly involved. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is packed with tension. Bond's quick thinking and action create a sense of urgency, but his capture and the threat of Le Chiffre's presence leave the reader on edge, wondering what will happen next.
