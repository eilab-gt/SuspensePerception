Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is clearly resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and has already anticipated Bond's attempt to intervene.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond's attempt to help Vesper is thwarted, he's quickly overpowered, and Le Chiffre's calm demeanor adds to the feeling that things are not going well for Bond.  We're left wondering what Le Chiffre's plans are and how Bond will manage to escape this situation.
