 Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?" - Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. There is no indication that Bond has any means of escape at the moment, so I would have to say that it is "not very likely" that he will escape from this situation without some external help or intervention.

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?" - I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of danger and urgency. The fact that Bond is a well-known and beloved character only adds to the suspense, as the reader is invested in his safety and well-being. Additionally, the use of descriptive language and specific details helps to bring the scene to life and make it feel more immediate and real. Overall, I would say that this passage is very effectively suspenseful.
