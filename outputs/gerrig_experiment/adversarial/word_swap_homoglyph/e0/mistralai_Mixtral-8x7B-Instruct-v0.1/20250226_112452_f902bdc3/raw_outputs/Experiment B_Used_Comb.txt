 Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?" - Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not provide enough context on what happens next. However, considering Bond's skills and experience, one might assume that he has a chance to escape or turn the situation around, so I would choose "moderately likely" as my answer.

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?" - I find this passage to be "very suspenseful" because it sets up a dangerous situation for Bond, who was previously confident and in control, and now finds himself trapped and vulnerable. The detailed description of Bond's capture and the taunting behavior of Le Chiffre adds to the tension and anticipation of what will happen next.
