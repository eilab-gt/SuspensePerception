 Question 1: Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." This assessment is made considering Bond''s resourcefulness and past experiences, but it is also tempered by the fact that he is currently restrained with piano wire and under the watch of Blofeld's henchman.

Question 2: Regarding the suspense level of the passage, I would rate it as "very suspenseful." The author has effectively created a tense atmosphere through the use of descriptive language and the portrayal of Bond's predicament, leaving the reader curious about Bond's fate and how he will manage to escape.
