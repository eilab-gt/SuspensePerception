Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Crushak has been instructed to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him, which further reduces the likelihood of Bond's escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The description of Crushak's ugly face and his menacing behavior adds to the sense of unease, and Blofeld's cold and calculating tone makes him a formidable and intimidating villain. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape or survive his captivity, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
