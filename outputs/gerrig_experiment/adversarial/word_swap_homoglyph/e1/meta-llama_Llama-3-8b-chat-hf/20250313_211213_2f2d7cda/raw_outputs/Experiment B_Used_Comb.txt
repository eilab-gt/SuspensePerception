Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught off guard and is now trapped with no clear means of escape. He has been disarmed and his comb, which could potentially be used as a weapon, has been taken away from him. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of danger and uncertainty. Bond, who was previously confident and in control, is now caught off guard and at the mercy of his captors. The sudden and unexpected attack, combined with Bond's vulnerability and Le Chiffre's menacing tone, creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will fall into Le Chiffre's trap.
