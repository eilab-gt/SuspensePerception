Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught and is now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been disarmed and his comb has been taken away, leaving him feeling puny and impotent. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond has been caught off guard and is now at the mercy of his captors. The description of the gunmen bursting into the room, guns drawn, is intense and frightening. The fact that Bond is unable to defend himself and is being searched and disarmed adds to the sense of suspense. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness, which adds to the overall sense of tension and suspense.
