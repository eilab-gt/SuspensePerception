Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which is causing him pain. Blofeld has also warned Bond that Crushak will shoot him if he tries to speak to him. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of Crushak's ugly face and Blofeld's sinister tone adds to the sense of unease. The use of vivid language, such as "the large bird crashed into the wall of glass", "the rug on which Blofeld stood", and "the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh",
