***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured and is now tied up by Crushak, who has orders to shoot if Bond even attempts to speak. This situation seems dire, but given Bond's history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations, the likelihood of his escape is uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes involved. Bond is captured and tied up, and his life is in immediate danger with Crushak's orders to shoot if Bond attempts to speak. The tension is heightened by the fact that Bond is a skilled agent who has escaped from dangerous situations before, leaving the reader uncertain about the outcome.
