***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, he is currently restrained and under the watchful eye of Crushak, who has been ordered to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak. This situation introduces uncertainty regarding Bond's ability to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and suspense. Bond's precarious situation, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the description of Bond being painfully tied up with piano wire all contribute to a sense of imminent danger. The fact that Bond's fate is uncertain and that he is at the mercy of a character described as "very large and very ugly" with a gun, adds to the suspense.
