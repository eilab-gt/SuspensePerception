Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown to be resourceful and cunning.  The passage highlights his quick thinking in using the distraction to try and escape.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's initial attempt at escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushhak, and the brutal way Bond is restrained. The threat of violence and the knowledge that Bond is trapped with a ruthless killer create a high level of suspense.
