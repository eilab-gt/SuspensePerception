Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and disarmed, he displays his usual resourcefulness and agility.  The passage emphasizes his ability to think quickly and adapt to dangerous situations.  However, he is outnumbered and at the mercy of Le Chiffre's cunning.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence shattered as he is ambushed. The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's menacing smile create a sense of impending danger. Bond's feeling of "puny and impotent" heightens the suspense, leaving the reader wondering how he will escape this predicament.
