***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Given the information provided and the context of the situation, it seems that Bond's chances of escape are compromised but not impossible. He has already shown quick thinking and physical agility in his attempt to follow Vesper and in his effort to conceal an action from his captors. However, he is outnumbered and outgunned, and his captors are alert and cautious. Considering these factors, I would rate his likelihood of escape as:

5. Moderately likely

Bond is a resourceful and experienced agent, which suggests he may have a plan or the ability to create an opportunity for escape. Yet, the situation is dangerous and his adversaries seem competent, which tempers the likelihood of his immediate escape.
