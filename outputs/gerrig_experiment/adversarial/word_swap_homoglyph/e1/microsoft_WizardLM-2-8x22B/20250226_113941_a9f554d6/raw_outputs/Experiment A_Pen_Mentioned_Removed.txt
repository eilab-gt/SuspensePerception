1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**
   - Given the context that Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, and considering the narrative tension that is characteristic of James Bond stories, it is reasonable to expect that Bond has a good chance of escaping. However, the immediate situation seems dire, with Bond being disarmed and outnumbered. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as:
     3. Slightly likely

2. **How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
   - The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation, the mention of weapons, and the potential for Bond to devise a plan even in these circumstances contribute to a high level of suspense. Based on this, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as:
     6. Very suspenseful
