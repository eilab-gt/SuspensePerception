Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness by using the bird distraction and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about Crushak being "devoted to eliminating such irritations" suggests a formidable opponent. However, Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations leaves room for some hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's menacing tone all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Crushak's "ugly" appearance and the painful tightening of the piano wire further heighten the suspense.
