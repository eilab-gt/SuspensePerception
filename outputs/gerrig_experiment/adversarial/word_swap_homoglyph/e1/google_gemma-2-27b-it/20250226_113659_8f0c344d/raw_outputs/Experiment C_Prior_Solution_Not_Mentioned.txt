Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued by Crushak.  Blofeld seems confident in his control, but Bond's history suggests he's resourceful and unlikely to stay captive indefinitely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's calm but threatening demeanor. The ending leaves the reader wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
