Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and fighting skills, he's outnumbered and outgunned. The fact that Le Chiffre seems to anticipate Bond's moves adds to the difficulty.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a desperate situation, outnumbered and facing a cunning opponent. The quick action and close calls keep the reader on edge.
