Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness by using the bird distraction and attempting to escape, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's explicit instructions and Crushak's menacing presence suggest a significant challenge for Bond. However, Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations leaves room for hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, followed by his capture and the introduction of the brutal Crushak, creates a palpable sense of danger. Blofeld's cold demeanor and explicit threat against Bond heighten the suspense, leaving the reader wondering how Bond will overcome this seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
