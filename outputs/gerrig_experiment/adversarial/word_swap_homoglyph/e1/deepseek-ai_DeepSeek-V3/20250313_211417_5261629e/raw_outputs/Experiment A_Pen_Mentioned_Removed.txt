1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

**Explanation:**  
- **Question 1:** Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under close surveillance by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His attempts to resist have been thwarted, and he is now completely at their mercy. The situation appears dire, making escape seem "not very likely."
