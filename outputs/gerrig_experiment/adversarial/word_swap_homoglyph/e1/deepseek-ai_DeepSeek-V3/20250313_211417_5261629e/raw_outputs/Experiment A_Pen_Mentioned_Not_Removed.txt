***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***  
**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful  

**Explanation:**  
1. Bond’s resourcefulness and quick thinking, such as his attempt to attack the gunmen and his subtle movement of the fountain pen, suggest he has a plan or at least the potential to escape. However, the situation is still precarious, making his escape only moderately likely at this point.  
2. The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes situation, Bond’s desperate actions, and the tension created by Le Chiffre’s calm yet menacing demeanor. The uncertainty of Bond’s fate and the immediate danger he and Vesper are in heighten the suspense.
