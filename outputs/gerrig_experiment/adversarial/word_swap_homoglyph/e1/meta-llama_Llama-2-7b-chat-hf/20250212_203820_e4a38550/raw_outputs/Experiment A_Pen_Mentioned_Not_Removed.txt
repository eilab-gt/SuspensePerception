Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to evade the gunmen and cause some damage, Le Chiffre seems to be a formidable opponent who has laid a successful trap for Bond. It's unclear at this point in the passage how Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While Bond is in a dangerous situation and trying to escape from Le Chiffre's gunmen, the passage doesn't feel overly suspenseful or tense. There is a sense of urgency and danger, but it's not quite at the level of a highly suspenseful passage.
