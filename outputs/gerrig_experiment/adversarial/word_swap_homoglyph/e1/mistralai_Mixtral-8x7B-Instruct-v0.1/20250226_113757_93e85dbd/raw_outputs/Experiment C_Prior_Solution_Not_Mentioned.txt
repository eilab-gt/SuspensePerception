 Question 1: Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." This is because, although Bond is currently in a difficult situation and has been overpowered by Blofeld and his men, Bond has proven himself to be a resourceful and skilled character in the past. However, the text does not provide enough information to make a more definitive assessment.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author uses descriptive language and vivid imagery to create a tense and dramatic atmosphere, and the situation in which Bond finds himself is certainly precarious. The use of the ominous character of Mr. Crushak and the details of Bond's restraint add to the suspense and uncertainty of the outcome.
