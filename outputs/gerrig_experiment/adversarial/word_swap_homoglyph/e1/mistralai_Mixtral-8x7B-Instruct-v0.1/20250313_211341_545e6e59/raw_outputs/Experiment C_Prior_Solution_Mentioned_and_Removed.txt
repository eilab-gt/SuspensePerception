 Question 1: Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Bond is currently a prisoner and in a difficult situation, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible circumstances. However, the presence of Crushak, who has been ordered to shoot him if he tries to speak, adds an extra layer of challenge.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author does an excellent job of building tension and uncertainty, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and how (or if) he will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches. The use of descriptive language and vivid imagery also helps to draw the reader in and keep them engaged in the story.
