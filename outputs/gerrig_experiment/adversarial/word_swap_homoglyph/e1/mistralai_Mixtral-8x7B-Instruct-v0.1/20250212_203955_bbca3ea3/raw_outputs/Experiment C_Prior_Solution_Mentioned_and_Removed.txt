 **Question 1:** Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely." While Bond is currently a prisoner and in a seemingly precarious situation, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. However, the presence of the large and menacing Mr. Crushak, who has orders to shoot Bond if he speaks, does make the situation more challenging.

**Question 2:** I find this passage to be "Very suspenseful." The author does an excellent job of building tension and suspense through the use of descriptive language and the depiction of Bond's dangerous situation. The presence of the menacing Mr. Crushak, who has orders to shoot Bond if he speaks, only adds to the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations leaves the reader wondering if and how he will be able to escape this time.
