 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him of his revolver. Although Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, it will likely be difficult for him to escape without any weapons. Therefore, I would answer "2. Somewhat likely" for this question.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but is ultimately captured and disarmed. This type of scene is often intended to create suspense and tension in the reader, as they are left wondering what will happen to Bond next. Therefore, I would answer "6. Very suspenseful" for this question.
