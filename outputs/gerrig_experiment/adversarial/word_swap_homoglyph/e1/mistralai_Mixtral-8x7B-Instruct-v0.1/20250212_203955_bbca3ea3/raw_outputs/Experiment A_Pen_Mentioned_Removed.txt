 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his men, and they have already disarmed him of his gun and what appears to be a fountain pen that may be a concealed weapon. Although Bond is a skilled and experienced agent, it is unclear if he has any other resources or allies to help him escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:
4. Neutral or Uncertain.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond has been captured and is at the mercy of his enemy, Le Chiffre. The scene is described with a sense of urgency and danger, as Bond tries to resist and escape but is quickly overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. The outcome of the situation is uncertain, and there is a sense of anticipation and suspense as to what will happen next. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as:
5. Moderately suspenseful.
