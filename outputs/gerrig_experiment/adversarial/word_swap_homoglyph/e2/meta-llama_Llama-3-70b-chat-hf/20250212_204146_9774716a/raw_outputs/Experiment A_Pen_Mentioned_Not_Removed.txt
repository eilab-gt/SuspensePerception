***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Bond trying to make a move to escape, but being caught and disarmed by Le Chiffre's henchmen. While Bond is resourceful and has managed to move his fountain pen deeper into his pocket, it's unclear whether this will be enough to help him escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and dramatic moments, such as Bond's sudden decision to act, the Corsican's quick reflexes, and the rough treatment by the gunmen. The sense of danger and uncertainty is palpable, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next.
