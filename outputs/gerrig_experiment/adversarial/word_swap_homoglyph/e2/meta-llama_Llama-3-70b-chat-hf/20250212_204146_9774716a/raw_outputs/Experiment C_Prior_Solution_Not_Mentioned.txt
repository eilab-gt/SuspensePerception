***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it's unlikely that the author would kill him off or leave him captive for the rest of the book.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "painfully" tight piano wire and the "very large and very ugly" Mr. Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this predicament.
