Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is facing a large and ugly gunman named Crushak. Blofeld has also made it clear that he intends to eliminate Bond, so it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and he is facing a ruthless and formidable opponent in Blofeld. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his predicament.
