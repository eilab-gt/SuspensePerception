Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which is causing him pain. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation without some kind of outside help or a clever plan.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is taunting him and threatening him with violence. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his predicament.
