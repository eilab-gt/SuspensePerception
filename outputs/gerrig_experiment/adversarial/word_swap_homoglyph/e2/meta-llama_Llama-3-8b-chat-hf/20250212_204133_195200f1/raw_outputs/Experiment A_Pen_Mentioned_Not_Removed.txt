Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Bond is being searched for weapons. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be caught. The use of descriptive language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage", adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
