Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has mentioned that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, which suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the setting, including the dark office and the large and ugly Crushak, adds to the sense of foreboding. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate, such as whether he will be able to escape or if he will be killed by Crushak. The suspense is heightened by Blofeld's cold and calculating demeanor, which suggests that he is not interested in negotiating or showing mercy. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
