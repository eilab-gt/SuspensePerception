Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed and is at their mercy. It's unlikely that he will escape without a plan or some kind of assistance.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond is in danger, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket", creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him and Vesper.
