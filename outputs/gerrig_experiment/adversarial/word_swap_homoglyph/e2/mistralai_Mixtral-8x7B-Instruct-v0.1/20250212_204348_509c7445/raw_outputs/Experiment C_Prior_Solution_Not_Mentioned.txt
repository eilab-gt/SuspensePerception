 **Answer to Question 1:** Based on the information provided in the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Bond is currently in a difficult situation, he has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past, which could potentially help him escape. However, he is also physically restrained and outnumbered, making escape challenging.

**Answer to Question 2:** I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author has created a tense atmosphere through the use of descriptive language and the actions of the characters. Bond is in a dangerous situation, and the reader is left wondering if and how he will escape. The introduction of a new character, Mr. Crushak, also adds to the suspense, as it is unclear how he will factor into the situation. Overall, the passage is well-written and effectively builds tension.
