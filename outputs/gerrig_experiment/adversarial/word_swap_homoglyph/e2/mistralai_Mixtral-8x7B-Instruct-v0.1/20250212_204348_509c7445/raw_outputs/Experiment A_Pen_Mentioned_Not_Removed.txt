 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Although Bond does show some resourcefulness in trying to escape and cause damage, it is unclear if he will be able to successfully escape from this situation. Therefore, I would answer "3. Slightly likely" for this question.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation in which Bond is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. There is a sense of uncertainty and suspense as to what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape. Therefore, I would answer "5. Moderately suspenseful" for this question.
