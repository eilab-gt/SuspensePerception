 Question 1: Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Bond is currently a prisoner and in a seemingly precarious situation, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. However, the text does not provide enough information to make a more definitive assessment.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author uses vivid language to describe the danger that Bond is in, and the tension is heightened by the presence of the menacing character, Crushak. Additionally, the fact that Bond has been captured before and managed to escape adds to the suspense, as the reader wonders if he will be able to do so again.
