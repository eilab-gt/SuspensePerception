 Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?" - Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not provide enough context on what happens next. However, considering Bond's skills and resourcefulness, one might assume that there is a possibility of him escaping, let's say "moderately likely" (5).

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?" - I find this passage to be "very suspenseful" (6). The sudden turn of events, where Bond goes from being confident and in control to being trapped by Le Chiffre and his men, creates a sense of uncertainty and tension that keeps the reader engaged and eager to find out what happens next.
