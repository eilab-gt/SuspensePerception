 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not provide enough context about the situation or Bond's abilities. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond being held captive and disarmed, and Le Chiffre appearing menacing and in control. This creates a sense of suspense for the reader as they do not know what will happen next. Therefore, I would select option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
