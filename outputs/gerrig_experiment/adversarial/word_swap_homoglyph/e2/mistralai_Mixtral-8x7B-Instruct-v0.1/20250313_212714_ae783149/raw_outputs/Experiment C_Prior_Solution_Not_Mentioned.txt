 Question 1: Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." This is because, although Bond is currently in a difficult situation and has been overpowered by Blofeld and his men, Bond has proven himself to be a resourceful and skilled character in the past. However, the text does not provide enough information to make a more definitive assessment.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author uses descriptive language and dramatic irony to build tension and create a sense of uncertainty about what will happen to Bond. The use of phrases such as "Bond took advantage of the distraction" and "As Bond's eyes grew accustomed to the dark" suggest that Bond is actively trying to escape and that the situation is still in flux. This creates a sense of anticipation and suspense for the reader.
