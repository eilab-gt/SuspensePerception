***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been resourceful in the past, but he is currently restrained and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, as Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of a large bird crashing into the window as a distraction, followed by Bond's quick thinking to pull up the rug, adds to the suspense. The description of Crushak and the method of restraining Bond with piano wire also heightens the sense of danger and suspense.
