***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under close surveillance by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His attempt to escape was quickly thwarted, and he is now being thoroughly searched. The situation appears dire, making escape seem "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to Bond's desperate attempt to escape, the physical confrontation, and the tension as Le Chiffre and his men methodically strip Bond of his weapons and resources. The stakes are high, and the outcome remains uncertain, contributing to the suspense.
