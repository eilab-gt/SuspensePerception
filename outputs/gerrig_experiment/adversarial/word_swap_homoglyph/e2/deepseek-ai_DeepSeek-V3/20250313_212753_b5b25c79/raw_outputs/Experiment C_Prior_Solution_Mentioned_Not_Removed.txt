***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tightly restrained with piano wire, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak is devoted to ensuring Bond does not escape. The situation seems dire, making escape "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is filled with tension, from the bird crashing into the glass to Bond's failed escape attempt and his subsequent restraint. The threat of Crushak and Blofeld's menacing tone heightens the suspense, making it "very suspenseful."
