1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's history of escaping from captivity and his ability to take advantage of distractions, as demonstrated in the excerpt, it seems moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld again. His resourcefulness and experience in such situations suggest that he has a fair chance of outwitting his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful. It begins with a tense confrontation, includes an action sequence with Bond attempting to create an opportunity for escape, and ends with Bond being secured in a precarious situation by a formidable and menacing character. The stakes are high, and the narrative elements combine to create a sense of danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate, which is the essence of suspense.
