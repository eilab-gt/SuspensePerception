Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The distraction with the bird and his initial attempt to escape suggest he won't go down without a fight. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's quick thinking, but he's quickly overpowered. The introduction of Crushak and the graphic description of Bond's binding create a sense of danger and uncertainty about his fate.
