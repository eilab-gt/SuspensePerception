Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly skilled and resourceful, he is currently outnumbered, disarmed, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre.  The passage emphasizes Bond's initial agility and quick thinking, but he is now trapped and Le Chiffre seems to be in control.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence shattered as he is ambushed. The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's smug demeanor create a sense of danger and uncertainty.  We know Bond is capable, but the situation is precarious, leaving the reader wondering how he will escape.
