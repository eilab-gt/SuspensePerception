Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The distraction with the bird and his initial attempt to escape suggest he won't go down without a fight. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's quick thinking, but it's immediately countered by Blofeld's calm threat and the introduction of the menacing Crushak. The description of the wire tightening around Bond's arms adds a physical element of suspense. 


Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of the choices further!
