Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled. The fact that he managed to land a blow on one of the gunmen, even while being caught off guard, suggests he's not easily defeated.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, Bond's initial struggle, and his ultimate capture create a strong sense of tension. The description of Le Chiffre's cold demeanor and Bond's feeling of helplessness further heighten the suspense.
