Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued by Crushak.  Blofeld seems confident in his control, but Bond's resourcefulness and history suggest he might find a way out, though it won't be easy.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the cat-and-mouse game between Bond and Blofeld. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, and the introduction of the menacing Crushak raises the stakes. The ending leaves Bond in a precarious situation, making the reader wonder how he will get out of it.
