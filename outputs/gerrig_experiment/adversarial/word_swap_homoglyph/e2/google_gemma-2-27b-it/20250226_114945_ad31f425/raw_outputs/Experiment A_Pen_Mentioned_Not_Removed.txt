Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control of the situation.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, there's a sense of urgency in his actions, and the description of Le Chiffre's cold demeanor adds to the suspense.  The ending line, "Let's not waste time," implies something ominous is about to happen.
