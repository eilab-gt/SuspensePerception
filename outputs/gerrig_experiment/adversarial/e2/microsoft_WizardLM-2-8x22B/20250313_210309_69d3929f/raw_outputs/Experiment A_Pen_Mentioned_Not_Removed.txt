1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's training and resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament. His quick thinking and physical prowess, as demonstrated by his attempt to follow Vesper and his agile recovery after being tripped, suggest that he is capable of seizing an opportunity to turn the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The physical confrontation, Bond's quick but unsuccessful attempt to resist, and the mention of a concealed item (the fountain pen) all contribute to a high level of suspense, leaving the reader curious and anxious about Bond's fate and how he might use his wits and available resources to escape.
