***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. Although he is currently trapped and tied up, it's likely that he will find a way to escape, given his skills and experience.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the "distressingly" tight wire, adds to the tension and creates a sense of urgency. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next.
