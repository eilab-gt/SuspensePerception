***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. Although he is currently trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it is likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of descriptive language, such as the "really large and very ugly" henchman, adds to the tension and creates a sense of foreboding. The fact that Bond is being tied up and threatened with death also increases the suspense, making the reader wonder how he will manage to escape.
