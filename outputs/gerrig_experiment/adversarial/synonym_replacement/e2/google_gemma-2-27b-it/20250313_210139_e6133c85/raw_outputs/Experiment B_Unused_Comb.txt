Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. The excerpt doesn't give us enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, the description of Le Chiffre's menacing presence, and Bond's initial struggle create a strong sense of suspense. The fact that he's now trapped and seemingly powerless adds to the tension.
