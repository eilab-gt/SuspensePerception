 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been captured by Blofeld and his men, and is currently tied up in a chair with a piece of wire digging into his flesh. Given this, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld anytime soon. So, I would answer "Not very likely" for this question.

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond has been captured by Blofeld and is in a precarious situation. The author uses vivid language to describe the danger that Bond is in, such as the wire digging into his flesh and the presence of armed guards. This creates a sense of tension and suspense for the reader, as they are left wondering what will happen to Bond next. Therefore, I would answer "Very suspenseful" for this question.
