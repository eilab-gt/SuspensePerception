 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Le Chiffre and his men, so I would say it's not very likely that he will escape on his own at this point. However, since this is a work of fiction, it's possible that Bond may escape or be rescued later on in the story.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The sudden appearance of Le Chiffre and his men and Bond's capture creates a sense of tension and uncertainty about what will happen next. However, since Bond has been in similar situations before and has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations, it's possible that the suspense may be short-lived.
