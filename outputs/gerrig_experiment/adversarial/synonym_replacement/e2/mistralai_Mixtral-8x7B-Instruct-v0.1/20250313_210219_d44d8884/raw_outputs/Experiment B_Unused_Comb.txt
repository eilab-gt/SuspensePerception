 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been caught off-guard and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men, which suggests that his chances of escaping are not very high at the moment. So, I would choose option 1, "Not very likely".

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and dramatic scene in which Bond, who had been confidently making plans to dine with Vesper, is suddenly ambushed and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men. This creates a strong sense of suspense, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape from this dangerous situation. Therefore, I would choose option 6, "Very suspenseful".
