1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being outnumbered and captured, Bond's skills and experience as a secret agent suggest that he has a reasonable chance of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is suddenly confronted by his enemy and his henchmen. The detailed description of the confrontation, including Bond's quick thinking and physical prowess, creates a sense of immediacy and danger. The fact that Bond is captured but not yet defeated, along with Le Chiffre's taunting, adds to the suspense, leaving the reader to wonder how Bond will extricate himself from this perilous predicament.
