***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured and is being restrained by Crushak, but given Bond's history of escaping from difficult situations, it is neither certain that he will escape nor that he will not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it involves a high-stakes situation where Bond, a character known for his resourcefulness, is captured and in immediate danger. The tension is heightened by the presence of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the use of the piano wire, which creates a sense of imminent physical harm for Bond. The uncertainty of Bond's fate adds to the suspense.
