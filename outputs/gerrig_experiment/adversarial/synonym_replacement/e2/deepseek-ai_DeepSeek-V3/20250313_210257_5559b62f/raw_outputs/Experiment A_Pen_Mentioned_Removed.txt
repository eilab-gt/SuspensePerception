1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under close watch by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His attempts to resist have been thwarted, and he has no obvious means of escape at this moment.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the tension of Bond's capture, his failed attempt to fight back, and the immediate threat posed by Le Chiffre and his men. The stakes are high, and the situation feels precarious.
