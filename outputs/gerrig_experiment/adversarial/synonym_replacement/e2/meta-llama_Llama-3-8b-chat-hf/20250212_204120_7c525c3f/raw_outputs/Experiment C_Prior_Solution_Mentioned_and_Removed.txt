Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has made it clear that Crushak is authorized to eliminate any attempts to escape or speak to him. The situation seems dire, and Bond's chances of escape appear slim.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and the reader is aware that he is in a precarious situation. The description of the setting, the characters, and the actions creates a sense of foreboding, making the reader feel like something bad is about to happen. The use of vivid language, such as "large and very ugly man", "deform his face into what he might have intended as a smile", and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
