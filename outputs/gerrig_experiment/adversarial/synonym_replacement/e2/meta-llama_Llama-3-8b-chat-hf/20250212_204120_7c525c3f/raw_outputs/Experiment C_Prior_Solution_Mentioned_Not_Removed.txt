Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is now a prisoner, tied up in a wooden armchair, and being guarded by two men, including the large and ugly Crushak.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is gloating over his capture. The description of Crushak as "large and very ugly" adds to the sense of menace, and the use of vivid language, such as "the big man contort his face into what he might have intended as a grinning. It made him look no less ugly", creates a sense of unease. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, keeping the reader engaged and curious.
