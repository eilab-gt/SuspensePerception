Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is now a prisoner, tied up in a wooden armchair, and being guarded by two men, including the large and ugly Crushak.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of Crushak as "large and very ugly" adds to the sense of unease, and Blofeld's cold and calculating demeanor makes him a formidable and intimidating villain. The use of vivid language, such as "the big man contort his face into what he might have intended as a grinning" and "the conducting wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding.
