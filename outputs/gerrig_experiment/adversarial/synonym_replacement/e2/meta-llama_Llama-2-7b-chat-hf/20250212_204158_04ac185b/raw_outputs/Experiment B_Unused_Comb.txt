  Great, thank you for providing the passage from Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, 'Casino Royale'. Based on the passage, here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond is shown to be resourceful and able to defend himself, he is also trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The passage does not provide any clear indication of how Bond will escape or if he will escape at all.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The sudden appearance of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the description of Bond's quick thinking and agility, and the mention of Bond being trapped and searched for weapons all contribute to a sense of tension and suspense. The passage also leaves the reader wondering how Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches, adding to the suspense.
