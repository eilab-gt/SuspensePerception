Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to create a distraction and potentially escape, he is still pinned down by the two gunmen and is in a vulnerable position. Blofeld also seems to be determined to keep Bond captive, so it's not clear how easily Bond will be able to escape.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency with Bond being held captive by Blofeld's gunmen, the passage doesn't feel overly suspenseful or tense. There is a sense of anticipation and uncertainty, but it's not a particularly intense or suspenseful moment in the passage.
