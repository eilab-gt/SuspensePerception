Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown to be resourceful and cunning.  The passage highlights his quick thinking in using the distraction to his advantage.  However, Blofeld seems more prepared this time, with the added threat of Crushak and his brutal orders.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond momentarily gain an advantage, only to be quickly thwarted. The introduction of Crushak and his violent nature adds a layer of fear and uncertainty. The threat of Bond being "torn" if he tries to speak heightens the suspense significantly.
