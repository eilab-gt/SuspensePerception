Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows his usual resourcefulness and fighting skills, he's clearly outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to have anticipated Bond's every move and has taken precautions to disarm him.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence turn to surprise and then to a desperate struggle. The description of the gunmen and Le Chiffre's actions creates a sense of danger.  The ending, with Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and the line "Net ball's not godforsaken time," leaves the reader wondering what Bond's fate will be.
