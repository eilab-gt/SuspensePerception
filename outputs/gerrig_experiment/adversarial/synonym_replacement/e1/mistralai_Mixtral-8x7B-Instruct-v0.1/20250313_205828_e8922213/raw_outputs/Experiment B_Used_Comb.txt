 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Le Chiffre and his men, so I would say it's not very likely that he will escape on his own at this point. However, since this is a work of fiction, it's possible that Bond may escape or be rescued later on in the story.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The sudden appearance of Le Chiffre and his men and the ensuing struggle create a tense atmosphere, and the fact that Bond is now a prisoner adds to the suspense. However, since the passage does not provide much information about what will happen next, the suspense is not at its maximum level.
