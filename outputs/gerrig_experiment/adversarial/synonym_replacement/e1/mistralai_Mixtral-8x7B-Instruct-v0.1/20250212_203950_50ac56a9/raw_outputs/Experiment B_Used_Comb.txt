 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Le Chiffre and his men, so I would say it's not very likely that he will escape on his own at this point. However, since this is a work of fiction, it's possible that he could still escape or be rescued later on in the story.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. While we know that Bond has been captured, we don't yet know what Le Chiffre plans to do with him or how Bond will ultimately escape. The details of Bond's capture are also described in a way that creates tension and anticipation for the reader.
