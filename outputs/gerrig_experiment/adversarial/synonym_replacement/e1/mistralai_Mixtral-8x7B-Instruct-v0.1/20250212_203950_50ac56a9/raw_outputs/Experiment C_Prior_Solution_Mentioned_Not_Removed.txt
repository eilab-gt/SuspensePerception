 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history and expertise as a secret agent, it is not impossible for him to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "somewhat likely" (option 2).

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and facing an uncertain future. The fact that Bond was able to outwit his captors in the past adds an element of uncertainty to the situation, as the reader is left wondering if he will be able to do so again. Additionally, the introduction of a new and formidable gunman, Crushak, adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
