Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. This does not bode well for Bond's chances of escape, especially since he is outnumbered and outgunned.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors, and that Bond is being disarmed and searched. The use of vivid language and descriptive phrases, such as "spidery summons", "whistling of pain", and "delicately, shot out his left hand", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
