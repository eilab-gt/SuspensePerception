Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has made it clear that Crushak is authorized to eliminate any attempts to escape or speak to him. This suggests that Bond's chances of escaping are low.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The description of Crushak's ugly face and Blofeld's sinister tone adds to the sense of foreboding, making the reader feel like something bad is about to happen. The use of vivid language, such as "the large light that had lit up the elbow room" and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
