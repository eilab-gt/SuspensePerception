Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has taken control of the situation. Bond's attempt to escape was foiled by Crushak's intervention, and he is now at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is in control. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" man Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The fact that Bond is being tortured and pinned down by wire also creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive the situation.
