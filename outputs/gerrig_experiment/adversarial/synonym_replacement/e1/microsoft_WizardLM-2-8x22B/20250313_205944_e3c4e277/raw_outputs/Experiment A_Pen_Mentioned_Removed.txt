1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a history of dealing with dangerous adversaries suggests that he has a fair chance of eventually getting out of this predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is a prisoner and has already attempted to escape, only to be subdued by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The detailed description of the physical confrontation and Bond's quick thinking to conceal his intentions add to the suspense, leaving the reader to wonder what will happen next and how Bond will manage to turn the situation to his advantage.
