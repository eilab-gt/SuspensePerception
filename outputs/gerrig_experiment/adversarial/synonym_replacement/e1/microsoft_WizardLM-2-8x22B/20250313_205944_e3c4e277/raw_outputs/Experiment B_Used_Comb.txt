1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he was able to incapacitate one of the gunmen and has already assessed his situation indicates that he is actively looking for an opportunity to turn the tables.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events where Bond, after a moment of vulnerability, is confronted by his nemesis and his henchmen. The detailed description of the confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the uncertainty of his predicament create a tense atmosphere that keeps the reader engaged and anxious to know how Bond will manage to escape.
