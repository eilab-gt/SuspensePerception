  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, the situation this time seems more dire, with Bond being tied up and surrounded by two gunmen. Blofeld also seems to have taken precautions to prevent Bond from escaping, such as using piano wire to restrain him.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The use of descriptive language and the tension created by the situation (Bond being trapped and threatened by Blofeld's gunmen) make for a very suspenseful read. The passage also builds on the tension by introducing a new character, Crushak, who is described as "really large and very ugly," which adds to the sense of unease and danger.
