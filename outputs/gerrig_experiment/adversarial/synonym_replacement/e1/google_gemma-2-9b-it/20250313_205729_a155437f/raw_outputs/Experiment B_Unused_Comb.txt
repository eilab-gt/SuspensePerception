Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly skilled and resourceful, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. Le Chiffre seems to have anticipated Bond's every move and has him firmly in his grasp.  However, Bond's history suggests he's not one to go down easily.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence shattered as he's ambushed. The description of the gunmen, Le Chiffre's calm demeanor, and the detail about the comb being taken away all contribute to a sense of impending danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
