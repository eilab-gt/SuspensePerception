Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and at a disadvantage, the excerpt hints at his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet.  He managed to use the distraction to his advantage initially, and Blofeld's words suggest Bond has outsmarted him before.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension with Bond's capture, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's threat.  The description of the wire tightening around Bond's arms adds a physical element of suspense. However, it's not yet at a point of extreme danger or cliffhanger.
