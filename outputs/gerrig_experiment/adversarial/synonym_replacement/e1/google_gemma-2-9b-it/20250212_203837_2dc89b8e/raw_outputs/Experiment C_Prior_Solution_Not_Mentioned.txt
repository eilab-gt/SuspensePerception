Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and bound, the excerpt shows his quick thinking and resourcefulness. He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand.  This suggests he might find another opportunity to escape, but Blofeld seems prepared and dangerous.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond is trapped, Blofeld is menacing, and the description of the binding is quite vivid.  However, it lacks the immediate, life-or-death urgency that would make it extremely suspenseful.
