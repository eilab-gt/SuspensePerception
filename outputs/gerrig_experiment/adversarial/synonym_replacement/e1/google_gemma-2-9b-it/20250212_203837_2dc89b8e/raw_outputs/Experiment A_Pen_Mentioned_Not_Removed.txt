Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Explanation:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He managed to briefly disrupt Le Chiffre's plan and even concealed his pen, suggesting he's looking for opportunities. However, he's outnumbered and disarmed, making a clean escape unlikely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Explanation:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The description of the physical struggle and Le Chiffre's calm demeanor add to the suspense.  We know Bond is in trouble, but his resourcefulness keeps us guessing about his next move.
