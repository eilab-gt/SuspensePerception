Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly skilled and resourceful, he's currently disarmed and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men.  The passage highlights Bond's quick thinking and agility, but it also emphasizes his vulnerability.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence turn to surprise and then to a struggle for control. The description of the gunmen, Le Chiffre's smirk, and the line "Net ball's not godforsaken time" all contribute to a sense of impending danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
