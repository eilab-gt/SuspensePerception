Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages a momentary advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken precautions against further escape attempts.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the menacing tone of Blofeld. However, Bond's capture and restraint somewhat diminish the suspense, leaving the reader wondering about his ultimate fate.
