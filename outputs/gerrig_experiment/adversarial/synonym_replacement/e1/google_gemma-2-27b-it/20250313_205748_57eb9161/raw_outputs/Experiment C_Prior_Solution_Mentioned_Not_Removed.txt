Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond manages to momentarily gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about Crushak being "devoted to eliminating such irritations" suggests a formidable opponent. However, Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations leaves room for hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's menacing tone all contribute to a sense of impending danger. The description of Crushak's appearance and actions adds to the suspense.
