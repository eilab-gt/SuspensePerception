***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and tied up, the passage does not convey a sense of hopelessness. Bond has already shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the window. Additionally, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it is likely that he will find a way to escape from his predicament.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the "forte piano wire" that is "biting more distressingly into Bond's flesh", creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, which adds to the suspense.
