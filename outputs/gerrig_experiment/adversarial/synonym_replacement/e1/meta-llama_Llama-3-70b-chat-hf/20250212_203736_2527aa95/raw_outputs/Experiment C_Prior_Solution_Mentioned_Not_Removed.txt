***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being trapped and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. However, Bond has a history of escaping from difficult situations, and the passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large and very ugly" henchman and the painful wrapping of piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of danger and tension. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate, which adds to the suspense.
