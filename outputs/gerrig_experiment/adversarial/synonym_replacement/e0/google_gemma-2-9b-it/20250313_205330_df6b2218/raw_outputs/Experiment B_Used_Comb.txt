Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly skilled and resourceful, he's currently disarmed and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men.  The passage highlights Bond's quick reflexes and ability to take immediate action, but it also emphasizes his vulnerability.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We know Bond is in a dangerous situation, and the details of his capture and Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor create a sense of unease.  However, it's not yet at a point of extreme peril or cliffhanger.
