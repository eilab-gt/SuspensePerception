Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and at a disadvantage, the excerpt hints at his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet.  The mention of his previous escape and Blofeld's comment about Crushak being responsible this time suggest that Bond might find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension with Bond's capture, the threat from Crushak, and Blofeld's menacing tone.  The description of the wire tightening around Bond's arms adds to the physical danger and suspense. However, it's not yet at a point of extreme, heart-pounding suspense.
