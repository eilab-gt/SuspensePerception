Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, the excerpt shows him to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He manages to initiate a fight, even if it's quickly interrupted.  His attempt to conceal his weapon suggests he's already strategizing.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The descriptions of the physical confrontation and Le Chiffre's watchful eye create a sense of immediate danger. The ending, with Le Chiffre's calm invitation, leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, eager to know what happens next.
