Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. Le Chiffre seems to be in control, and Bond's initial attempt to escape was thwarted. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The quick movements, the descriptions of the gunmen's actions, and Le Chiffre's calm demeanor all contribute to a sense of impending danger.
