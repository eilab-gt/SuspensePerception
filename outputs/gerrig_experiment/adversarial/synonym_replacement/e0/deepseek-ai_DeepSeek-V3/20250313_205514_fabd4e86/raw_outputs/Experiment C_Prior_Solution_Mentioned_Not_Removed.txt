***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1:** Bond is tightly bound with piano wire, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak is devoted to ensuring Bond doesn’t escape. The situation seems dire, making escape seem "not very likely."  
- **Question 2:** The passage is suspenseful due to the tension created by Bond’s capture, the threat of violence, and the uncertainty of what Blofeld might do next. The description of the wire cutting into Bond’s flesh and the menacing presence of Crushak heighten the suspense.
