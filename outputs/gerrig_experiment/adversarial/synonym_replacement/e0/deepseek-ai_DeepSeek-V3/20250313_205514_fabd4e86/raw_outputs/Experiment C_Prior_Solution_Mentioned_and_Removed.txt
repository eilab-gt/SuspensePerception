***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tightly bound with piano wire, guarded by a devoted and intimidating henchman, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Bond will not be given any opportunities to escape. The situation seems dire, making escape "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes situation, Bond's failed attempt to escape, and the menacing presence of Blofeld and Crushak. The tension is palpable, especially with the detailed description of Bond's restraints and the threat of violence.
