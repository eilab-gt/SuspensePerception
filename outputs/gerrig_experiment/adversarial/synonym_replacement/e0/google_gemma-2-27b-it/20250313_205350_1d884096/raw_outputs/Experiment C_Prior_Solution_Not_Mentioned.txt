Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages a momentary advantage, he's quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld seems to be in control and intends to keep Bond captive. However, Bond is resourceful and has escaped tricky situations before, leaving a glimmer of hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's calm but menacing demeanor. The description of Bond being tied up adds to the tension.  We're left wondering what Blofeld's ultimate plan is and if Bond will find a way out.
