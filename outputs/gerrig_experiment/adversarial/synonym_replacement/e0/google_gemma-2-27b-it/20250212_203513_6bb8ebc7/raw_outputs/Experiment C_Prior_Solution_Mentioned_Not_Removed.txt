Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond manages to momentarily gain an advantage by using the distraction of the bird, he is quickly subdued by Crushak.  Blofeld seems confident in Crushak's ability to keep Bond contained, but Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations suggests he still has a chance.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond briefly gains the upper hand, only to be thwarted. Blofeld's calm demeanor and the introduction of the menacing Crushak heighten the sense of danger. The description of Bond being bound painfully adds to the suspense.
