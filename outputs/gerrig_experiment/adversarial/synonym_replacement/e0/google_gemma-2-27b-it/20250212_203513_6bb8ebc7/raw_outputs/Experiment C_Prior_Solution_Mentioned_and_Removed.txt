Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages to momentarily gain an advantage, Blofeld quickly regains control and introduces a new, seemingly more formidable guard, Crushak. This suggests that escape will be difficult, but Bond's history of cunning and resourcefulness leaves a sliver of hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, a menacing new character is introduced, and Blofeld explicitly threatens Bond with violence. The description of Crushak's appearance and demeanor adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty.
