  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to outwit Blofeld's guards in the past, the situation seems more dire this time around, with Bond being tied up and surrounded by two gunmen. It's unclear if Bond will be able to find a way out of this predicament.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The sudden appearance of the bird crashing into the wall of glass, followed by the unexpected turn of events with the gunman appearing and tying up Bond, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty that keeps the reader on edge. The use of dark and the description of the ugly world gunman as "really large and very ugly" adds to the overall sense of foreboding and danger.
