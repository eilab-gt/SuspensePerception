***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, he is currently restrained and under the watch of Crushak, who has been described as large and ugly, and is ordered to be particularly vigilant.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, as Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemy, Blofeld. The introduction of Crushak, who is described as large and ugly, and the detail of how he restrains Bond with piano wire, adds to the suspense. The threat of violence and the mention of a previous guard's death also contribute to the high level of suspense.
