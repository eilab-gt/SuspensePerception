***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured before and managed to escape, but the current situation with Crushak and the painful piano wire restraints adds uncertainty to the outcome.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, as Bond is captured and restrained by a formidable adversary. The use of piano wire to bind Bond adds a sense of danger and pain, while the mention of a previous guard's death and the introduction of Crushak as a new threat heightens the suspense.
