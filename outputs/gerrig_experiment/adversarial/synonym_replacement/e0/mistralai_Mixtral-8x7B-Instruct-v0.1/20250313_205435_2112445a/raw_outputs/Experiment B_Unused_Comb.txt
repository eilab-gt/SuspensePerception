 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his men, so it seems unlikely that he will escape without some difficulty. I would choose option 1, "Not very likely."

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation in which Bond is at the mercy of his enemy, Le Chiffre. This seems like a suspenseful situation to me, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape. I would choose option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
