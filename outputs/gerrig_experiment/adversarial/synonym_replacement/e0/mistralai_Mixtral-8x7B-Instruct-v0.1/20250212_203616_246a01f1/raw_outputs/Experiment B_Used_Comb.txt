 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Le Chiffre and his men, so I would say it's not very likely that he will escape on his own at this point. However, since this is a work of fiction, it's possible that Bond may escape or be rescued later on in the story.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The sudden appearance of Le Chiffre and his men creates a tense and dangerous situation for Bond, and the fact that he is now their prisoner raises the stakes and makes the reader wonder what will happen next.
