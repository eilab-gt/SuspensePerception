 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been captured by Blofeld and his men, and is currently tied up in a chair with a piece of wire digging into his flesh. Given this, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld anytime soon. So, I would answer "Not very likely" for this question.

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond is trying to escape from Blofeld's clutches, only to be caught and tied up by one of Blofeld's men. The stakes are high, as Bond's life is in danger, and the scene is described in detail, with a focus on the growing tension between Bond and Blofeld. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Very suspenseful".
