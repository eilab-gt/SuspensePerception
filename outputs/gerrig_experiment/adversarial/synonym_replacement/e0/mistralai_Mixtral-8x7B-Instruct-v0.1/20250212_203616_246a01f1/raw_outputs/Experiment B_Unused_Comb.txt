 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Le Chiffre and his men, so I would say it's "not very likely" that he will escape at this point.

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being captured by his enemy after a brief struggle. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful."
