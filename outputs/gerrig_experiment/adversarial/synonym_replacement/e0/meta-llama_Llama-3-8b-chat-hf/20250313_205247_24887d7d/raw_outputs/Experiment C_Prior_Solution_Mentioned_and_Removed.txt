Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has made it clear that Crushak is authorized to eliminate any attempts to escape or speak to him. The situation seems dire for Bond, making it unlikely that he will escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak, and the threat of violence and death is palpable. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of suspense and danger.
