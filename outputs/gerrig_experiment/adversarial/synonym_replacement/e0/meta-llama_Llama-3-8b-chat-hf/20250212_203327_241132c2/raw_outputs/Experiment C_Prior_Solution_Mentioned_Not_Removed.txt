Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld, given that he is now a prisoner, tied up in a wooden armchair, and being guarded by two men, including the large and ugly Crushak.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the setting, including the dark office and the large and ugly Crushak, adds to the sense of foreboding. The dialogue between Blofeld and Bond is also tense and menacing, making the reader feel like something bad is about to happen.
