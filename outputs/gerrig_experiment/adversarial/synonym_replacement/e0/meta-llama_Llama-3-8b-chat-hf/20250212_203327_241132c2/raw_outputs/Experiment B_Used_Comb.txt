Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond has been caught off guard and is now trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has managed to disarm one of the gunmen, but he is still outnumbered and outmaneuvered. It's unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden burst of the door and the appearance of the gunmen is a shocking and unexpected event. The fact that Bond is caught off guard and is unable to defend himself adds to the sense of suspense. The description of the scene, including the use of words like "burst", "guns drawn", and "crash to the ground", creates a vivid and intense atmosphere that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
