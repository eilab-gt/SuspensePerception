Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained and threatened. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and threatened by Blofeld and Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions and the sense of urgency and danger creates a sense of suspense that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
