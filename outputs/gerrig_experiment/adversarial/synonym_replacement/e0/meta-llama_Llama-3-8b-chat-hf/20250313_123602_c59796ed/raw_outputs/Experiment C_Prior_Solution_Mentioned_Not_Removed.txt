Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and is being restrained by piano wire. Additionally, Blofeld has made it clear that he intends to eliminate Bond, and has a skilled and ruthless henchman, Crushak, to carry out the task.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, and that Blofeld and Crushak are determined to eliminate him. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful restraint of piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape or survive his captivity.
