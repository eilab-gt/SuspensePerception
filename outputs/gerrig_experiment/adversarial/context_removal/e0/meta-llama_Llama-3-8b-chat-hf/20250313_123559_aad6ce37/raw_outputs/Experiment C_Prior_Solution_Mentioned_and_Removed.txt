Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair and has been warned that if he tries to speak to Crushak, he will be shot. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of dark lighting, the sound of the bird crashing into the wall, and the ominous tone of Blofeld's voice all contribute to a sense of foreboding. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what will happen to Bond next.
