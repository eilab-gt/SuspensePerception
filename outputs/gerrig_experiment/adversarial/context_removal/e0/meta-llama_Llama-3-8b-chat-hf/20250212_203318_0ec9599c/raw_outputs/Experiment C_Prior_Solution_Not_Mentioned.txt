Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He has been tied up in a wooden armchair and is at the mercy of his captors. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's capture and imprisonment by Blofeld, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of dark and ominous language, such as "the dark of the office" and "the large man contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", adds to the suspense. The reader is also left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from his predicament, which creates a sense of tension and anticipation.
