Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. This does not seem like a favorable situation for Bond to escape, so I would say it's not very likely.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Bond is being disarmed and searched. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be harmed. The use of words like "spidery", "unquiet", and "brusquely" adds to the sense of tension and foreboding, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
