Answering Question 1:

I choose option 1: Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he's being guarded by two gunmen. The situation doesn't look promising for his escape.

Answering Question 2:

I choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tension and suspense. The sudden crash of the bird into the wall, the distraction it provides, and Bond's attempt to take advantage of it all create a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is trapped and being guarded by two gunmen, with no clear way to escape, adds to the suspense. The darkening of the room and the revelation of another gun pointing at Bond's chest only heightens the tension. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
