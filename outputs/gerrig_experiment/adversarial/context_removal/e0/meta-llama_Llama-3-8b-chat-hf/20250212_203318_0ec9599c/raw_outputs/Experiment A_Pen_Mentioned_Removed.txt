Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and disarmed. Bond's plan to cause damage to the gunmen and exchange words with Vesper has been foiled, and he is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and disarmed, and his captors are taking him away from Vesper. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on their captors. The use of short, sharp sentences and the focus on Bond's actions and thoughts creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
