Answering Question 1:

I choose option 1: Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he's being guarded by two gunmen, including Crushak. The situation doesn't look promising for Bond's escape.

Answering Question 2:

I choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation for Bond. He's trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he'll manage to escape. The use of a sudden and unexpected event (the bird crashing into the wall) adds to the suspense, and the reader is left on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what will happen next.
