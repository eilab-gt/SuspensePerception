Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. This does not look like a promising situation for Bond's escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond and Vesper are trapped, and Bond is being disarmed and searched. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors. The use of phrases like "crashed to the ground", "agilely", and "trained on Bond's unquiet chest" adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
