 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "moderately likely." While Bond is currently a prisoner and has been outmaneuvered by Blofeld, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. However, it is also possible that Bond may not be able to escape in this particular instance, so it is not a certainty.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I would rate this passage as "very suspenseful." The author has created a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond as a prisoner and facing an enemy who has previously captured and outsmarted him. The use of descriptive language and the inclusion of details such as the "large bird" crashing into the window and the "piano wire" used to bind Bond all contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. The fact that Bond has been able to escape from captivity in the past also adds an element of uncertainty and anticipation, as readers may be wondering if he will be able to do so again in this situation.
