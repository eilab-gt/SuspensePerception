 Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his men, and they have taken steps to secure him in a chair with piano wire. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily or in the near future. Therefore, I would answer Question 1 as follows:

1. Not very likely

As for Question 2, the excerpt describes a tense and dramatic situation in which Bond is trying to escape from Blofeld and his men, only to be caught and restrained. This creates a sense of suspense, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or not. Therefore, I would answer Question 2 as follows:

5. Moderately suspenseful
