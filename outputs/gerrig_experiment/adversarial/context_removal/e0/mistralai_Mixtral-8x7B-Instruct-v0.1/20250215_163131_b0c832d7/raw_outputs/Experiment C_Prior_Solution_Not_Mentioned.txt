 Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his men, and they have taken steps to secure him in a chair with piano wire. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will easily escape from his current situation, so I would answer Question 1 with option 1: "Not very likely."

As for Question 2, the excerpt describes a tense and dramatic scene in which Bond is trying to escape from Blofeld's office and is ultimately captured. This type of scene is often intended to be suspenseful, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and how he will manage to escape from his predicament. Therefore, I would answer Question 2 with option 5: "Moderately suspenseful."
