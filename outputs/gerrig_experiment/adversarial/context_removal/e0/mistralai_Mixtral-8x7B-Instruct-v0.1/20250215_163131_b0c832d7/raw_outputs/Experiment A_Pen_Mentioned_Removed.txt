 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is trying to resist and cause damage to the gunmen, but he has been captured and disarmed. The outcome of his plan to escape is not revealed in the excerpt. Therefore, I would answer "4. Neutral or Uncertain" to Question 1.

Question 2: As for Question 2, the passage describes a tense and suspenseful situation where Bond is trying to escape and protect Vesper. The use of language such as "spidery summons," "as much damage as possible," and "hurried words" adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would answer "5. Moderately suspenseful" to Question 2.
