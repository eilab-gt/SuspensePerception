 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we know that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. However, it is important to note that Bond has a history of escaping from dangerous situations and completing his missions. Considering this, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as moderately likely (option 5).

Question 2: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and Bond is planning to escape and communicate with Vesper. The level of suspense in this passage is moderately suspenseful (option 5) as the outcome of Bond's plan is uncertain, and there is a risk of danger to his life.
