 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is trying to resist and cause damage to the gunmen, but he has been disarmed and captured. The outcome of his escape is uncertain at this point, so I would choose "4. Neutral or Uncertain."

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and Bond is trying to resist and cause damage, I would choose "5. Moderately suspenseful." The tension is building as the situation is uncertain and potentially dangerous for Bond and Vesper.
