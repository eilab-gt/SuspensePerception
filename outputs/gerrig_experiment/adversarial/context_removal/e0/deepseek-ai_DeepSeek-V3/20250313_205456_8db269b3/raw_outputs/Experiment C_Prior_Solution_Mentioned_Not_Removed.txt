***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tightly restrained with piano wire and under the watch of Crushak, who seems more competent than Blofeld’s previous guard. This makes escape seem unlikely at this moment.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes situation, Bond’s failed attempt to escape, and the tension created by Blofeld’s menacing demeanor and the threat of further danger.
