Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, Blofeld has also laid a successful trap for him and has a pair of gunmen guarding him. It's not clear how much control Bond has over his situation, and Blofeld seems to have the upper hand.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency in the scene, the outcome is not entirely clear, and Bond has a chance to escape. The use of descriptive language and the tension between Bond and Blofeld help to create a sense of suspense. However, the passage is not extremely suspenseful, as the outcome is not completely unpredictable and there is a sense of familiarity to the situation.
