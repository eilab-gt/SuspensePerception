  Answer Question 1:

The likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is: Somewhat likely. Although Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond, Bond is still determined to escape and cause damage to the two gunmen. His plan to exchange a few words with the girl and hide his fountain pen in his breast pocket suggests that he is still hoping to find a way out of the situation.

Answer Question 2:

The passage is: Very suspenseful. The use of words such as "crashed," "rolled," "searched," and "twisted" create a sense of urgency and tension, and the fact that Bond is being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen adds to the suspense. The passage also sets up a sense of uncertainty, as Bond's plan to escape is not yet clear and Le Chiffre's intentions are not fully revealed.
