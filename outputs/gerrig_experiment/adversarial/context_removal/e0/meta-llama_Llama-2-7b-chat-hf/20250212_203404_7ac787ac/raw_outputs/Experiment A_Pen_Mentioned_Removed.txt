Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to outsmart Le Chiffre and cause him to lose money gambling, Le Chiffre has also laid a successful trap for Bond and has him and Vesper under his control. It's unclear at this point in the passage how Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While Bond is in a dangerous situation and is being held captive by Le Chiffre, the passage doesn't provide a lot of tension or suspense. The focus seems to be more on Bond's plan to escape and the interactions between Bond and Le Chiffre, rather than on the suspense of the situation.
