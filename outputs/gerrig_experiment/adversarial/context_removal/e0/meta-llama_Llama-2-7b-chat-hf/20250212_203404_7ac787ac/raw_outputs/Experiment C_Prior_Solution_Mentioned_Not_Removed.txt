  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, Blofeld has already laid a successful trap for him and has a gunman guarding the door. It's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of help or plan.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency with Bond trying to escape from Blofeld's office, the passage doesn't feel overly suspenseful or tense. There is a sense of anticipation and uncertainty, but it's not quite at the level of a highly suspenseful passage.
