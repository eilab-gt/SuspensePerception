Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently restrained, the passage highlights his quick thinking and resourcefulness (pulling the rug, using the distraction).  Fleming often sets up seemingly hopeless situations for Bond, only for him to find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is captured, Blofeld is clearly menacing, and the mention of Crushak being responsible for Bond this time implies a potential threat. However, it's not yet a high-stakes, heart-pounding situation.
