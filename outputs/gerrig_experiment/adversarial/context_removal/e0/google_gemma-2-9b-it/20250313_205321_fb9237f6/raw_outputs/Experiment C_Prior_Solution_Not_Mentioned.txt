Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and tied up, the excerpt shows he's resourceful and quick-thinking. He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand.  This suggests he might find a way to escape, but Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken precautions.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped, Blofeld is clearly dangerous, and the situation feels precarious.  We know Bond is capable, but the odds seem stacked against him. This creates a moderate level of suspense as we anticipate what will happen next.
