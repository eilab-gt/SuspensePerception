Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and capable.  The excerpt highlights his initial quick thinking in disarming one of the gunmen, suggesting he might find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence turn to vulnerability as he's overpowered. The description of the search and Le Chiffre's calm demeanor create a sense of unease and anticipation for what might happen next.
