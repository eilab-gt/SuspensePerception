Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently restrained, the passage highlights his quick thinking and resourcefulness. He managed to create a distraction and make a move towards escape.  Fleming's writing often emphasizes Bond's ability to overcome seemingly impossible odds, so a full escape isn't entirely out of the question.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden darkness, the appearance of another gun, and Blofeld's menacing words all contribute to a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
