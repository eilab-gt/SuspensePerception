Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently restrained and Blofeld has made it clear he intends to kill Bond if he tries to speak, Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape seemingly impossible situations.  The excerpt hints at Bond's quick thinking with the rug distraction, suggesting he might find another way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is captured, restrained, and facing a deadly threat. Blofeld's menacing tone and the introduction of the ruthless Crushak heighten the suspense.  We know Bond is in a precarious situation, but his history of survival leaves room for hope and anticipation.
