1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and experience in dangerous situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he is already formulating a plan to do damage to the gunmen and speak with Vesper suggests that he is actively looking for opportunities to change the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is very suspenseful as it sets up a tense scenario where Bond is outnumbered and captured, yet there is an implication that he is already planning his next move. The reader is left in suspense, wondering how Bond will manage to turn the tables on his captors and what the outcome of his plan will be. The stakes are high, and the potential for violence or a clever escape contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere.
