Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, his quick thinking and attempt to position his pen (possibly a weaponized one) suggest he's not giving up hope.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates tension through several elements:

* **Bond's capture:** He's outnumbered and outgunned.
* **Le Chiffre's control:** He's portrayed as cunning and dangerous.
* **Bond's hidden weapon:** The focus on the pen creates anticipation about its potential use.
* **Vesper's fate:** Her separation from Bond adds another layer of worry.
