Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **5. Moderately likely** 

* **Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured, the passage highlights his quick thinking and agility ("rolled agilely," "motion that he hoped went unnoticed").
