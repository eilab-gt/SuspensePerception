Here are my answers based on the provided passage:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a difficult situation, he is resourceful and has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations. The fact that he managed to land a blow on one of the gunmen suggests he still has some fight in him.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a strong sense of suspense through the sudden ambush, the description of Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor, and Bond's feeling of helplessness. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament.
