Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems prepared for Bond's tricks this time, making a clean escape seem unlikely. However, Bond is resourceful and the story is far from over, leaving a sliver of hope for his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the sudden turn of events, Bond's brief moment of opportunity, and his subsequent capture. The introduction of Crushak as a new, potentially more capable guard adds to the tension. The ending leaves the reader wondering what Blofeld's plans are and how Bond will fare against this new challenge.
