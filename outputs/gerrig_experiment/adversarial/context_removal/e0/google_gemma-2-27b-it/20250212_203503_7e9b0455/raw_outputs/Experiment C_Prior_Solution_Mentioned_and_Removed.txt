Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld seems prepared for Bond's tricks this time, making a clean escape seem unlikely. However, Bond is resourceful and the story is far from over, leaving a sliver of hope for his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, he's captured and bound, and Blofeld's threat to have him shot adds a significant layer of danger. The mention of Crushak being responsible for Bond this time, after a previous guard was outsmarted, raises the stakes and creates a sense of impending danger.
