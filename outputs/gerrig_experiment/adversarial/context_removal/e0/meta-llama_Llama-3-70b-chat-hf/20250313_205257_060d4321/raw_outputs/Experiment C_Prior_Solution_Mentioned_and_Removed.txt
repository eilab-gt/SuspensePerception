***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it is likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchmen, and the threat of being shot if he attempts to speak or escape adds to the sense of danger and urgency. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this situation.
