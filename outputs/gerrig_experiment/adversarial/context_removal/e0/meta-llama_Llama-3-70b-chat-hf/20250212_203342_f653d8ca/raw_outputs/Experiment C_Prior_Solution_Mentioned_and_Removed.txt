***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it's likely that the author will find a way for him to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of details like the piano wire and the threat of being shot if Bond attempts to speak adds to the sense of urgency and suspense.
