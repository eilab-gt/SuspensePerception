Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently disarmed and outnumbered. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and is actively preventing Bond from accessing his weapon.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and his plans are thwarted.  The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's watchful eye heightens the feeling of danger.
