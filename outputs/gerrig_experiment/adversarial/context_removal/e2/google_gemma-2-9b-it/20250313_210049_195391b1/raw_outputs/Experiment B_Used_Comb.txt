Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and capable.  The excerpt highlights his initial quick thinking in disarming one of the gunmen, suggesting he might find a way to turn the tables.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence shattered as he's overpowered. The detail about Le Chiffre examining the comb adds a layer of mystery and suggests a potential threat beyond the immediate physical danger.
