Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages to momentarily gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control of the situation. However, Bond is resourceful and has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations, so a slight chance of escape remains.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden shift in power dynamics, and the threat implied by Blofeld's words. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament.
