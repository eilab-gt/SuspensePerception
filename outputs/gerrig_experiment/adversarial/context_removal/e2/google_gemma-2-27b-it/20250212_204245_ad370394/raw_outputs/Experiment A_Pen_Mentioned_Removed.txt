Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, his quick thinking and attempt to position his pen suggest he's not giving up hope. He's planning to cause damage and talk to Vesper, indicating a desire to fight back and potentially find a way out.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and facing a cunning adversary. The description of Le Chiffre's actions and Bond's internal thoughts create a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering if Bond's plan will work and what will happen to him and Vesper.
