Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld seems to be taking extra precautions this time, making a clean escape less likely. However, this is James Bond we're talking about, and he's known for his resourcefulness.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, and Blofeld's menacing tone and the threat to Bond's life heighten the suspense. The introduction of Crushak as a vigilant guard adds another layer of danger.
