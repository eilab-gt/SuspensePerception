Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, his quick thinking in moving his pen and his determination to "do as much damage as possible" suggest he's not giving up hope. This, combined with his reputation as a resourceful agent, makes a slight chance of escape plausible.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and disarmed. Le Chiffre's actions are menacing, and the mention of Bond wanting to "exchange a few hurried words" with Vesper implies a sense of urgency and danger for her as well.
