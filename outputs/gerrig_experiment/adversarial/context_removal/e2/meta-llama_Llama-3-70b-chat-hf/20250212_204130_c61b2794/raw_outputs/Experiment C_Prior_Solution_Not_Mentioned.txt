***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it is likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's trap.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large bird crashed into the wall of glass" and "the large man contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", adds to the sense of drama and suspense. The fact that Bond is tied up and left to "contemplate his rude behavior" creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about how he will escape, which adds to the suspense.
