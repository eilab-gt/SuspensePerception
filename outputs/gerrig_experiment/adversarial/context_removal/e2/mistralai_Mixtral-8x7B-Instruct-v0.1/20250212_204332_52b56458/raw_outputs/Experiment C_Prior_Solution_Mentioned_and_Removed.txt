 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not provide enough context about Bond's situation or his abilities. However, considering Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, one might assume that there is a moderate chance of him escaping. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain" or option 5, "Moderately likely" for this question.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being held captive by a dangerous criminal and facing an uncertain future. The fact that Bond was able to create a distraction and attempt to escape, only to be caught and restrained more securely, adds to the suspense. Additionally, the threat of violence from Blofeld's henchman Crushak creates a sense of danger and urgency. Therefore, I would select option 5, "Moderately suspenseful" or option 6, "Very suspenseful" for this question.
