 Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being outnumbered and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his men. However, it is important to note that Bond has a history of being able to escape from seemingly impossible situations. That being said, it is still unclear exactly how Bond will be able to escape from this situation, so I would rate the likelihood of him escaping as:

1. Not very likely

As for the suspense level of this passage, I would rate it as:

6. Very suspenseful

The author does a good job of building tension and suspense in this scene, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and how he will be able to escape from this dangerous situation.
