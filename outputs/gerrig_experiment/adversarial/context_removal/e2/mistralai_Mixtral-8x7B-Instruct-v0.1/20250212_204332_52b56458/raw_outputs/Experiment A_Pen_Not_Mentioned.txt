 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we know that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. However, Bond does have a history of being resourceful and escaping from dangerous situations. But, without specific details about the current situation, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of his escape. Therefore, I would select option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain."

Question 2: The level of suspense in a passage can be subjective and depends on the reader's interpretation. However, in this passage, Bond has been captured by a criminal figure and is in a potentially dangerous situation. There is also a sense of uncertainty about what will happen next. Therefore, I would select option 5, "Moderately suspenseful."
