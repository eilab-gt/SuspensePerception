 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "somewhat likely." While Bond is certainly a skilled and experienced agent, he is currently outnumbered and disarmed. However, there are still several unknown factors, such as the layout of the room and the capabilities of Vesper, that could potentially play a role in Bond's favor.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The sudden and violent intrusion of Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of danger and urgency, and the fact that Bond is currently unarmed and outnumbered only adds to the tension. Additionally, the use of descriptive language, such as Bond feeling "puny and impotent," helps to convey his sense of vulnerability and further heightens the suspense.
