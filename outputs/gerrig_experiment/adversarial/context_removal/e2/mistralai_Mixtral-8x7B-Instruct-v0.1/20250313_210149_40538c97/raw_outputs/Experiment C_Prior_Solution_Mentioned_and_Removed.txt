 Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is difficult to determine with certainty how likely it is that Bond will escape from Blofeld. However, considering Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations, one might lean towards options 5, 6, or 7 (moderately likely, very likely, or extremely likely).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being held captive by a dangerous adversary. The fact that Bond was able to cause Blofeld significant gambling losses and is now a prisoner suggests that there is more to the story, which can create a sense of intrigue and anticipation. Overall, I would rate the suspense level as 6, very suspenseful.
