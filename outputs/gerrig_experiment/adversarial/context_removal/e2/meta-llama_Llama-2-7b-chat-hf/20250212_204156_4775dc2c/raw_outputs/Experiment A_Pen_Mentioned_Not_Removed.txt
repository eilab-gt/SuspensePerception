Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to outsmart Le Chiffre and cause him to lose money gambling, Le Chiffre has also laid a successful trap for Bond and has him and Vesper under his control. It's unclear at this point in the story how Bond will manage to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While Bond is in a dangerous situation and is being searched for weapons by Le Chiffre's gunmen, the passage doesn't feel overly suspenseful or tense. There is a sense of urgency and danger, but it's not quite at the level of a highly suspenseful passage.
