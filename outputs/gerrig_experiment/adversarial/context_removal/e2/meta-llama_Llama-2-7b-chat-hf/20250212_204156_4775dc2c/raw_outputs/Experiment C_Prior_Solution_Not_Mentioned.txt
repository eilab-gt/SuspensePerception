Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, Blofeld has also laid a successful trap for him and has a pair of gunmen to keep him captive. It's not clear how Bond will be able to overcome this situation and escape.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency in the passage, as Bond is being held captive by Blofeld, the exact outcome is not entirely clear and there is a sense of uncertainty that adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not reach the highest level of suspense, as the outcome is not entirely unexpected and there are some clues that suggest Bond may be able to escape.
