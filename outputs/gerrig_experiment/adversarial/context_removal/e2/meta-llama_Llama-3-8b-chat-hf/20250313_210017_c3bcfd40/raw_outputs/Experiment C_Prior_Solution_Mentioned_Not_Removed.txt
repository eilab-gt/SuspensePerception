Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He has been tied up in a wooden armchair, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has taken measures to ensure that Bond will not be able to outwit his guard this time, as he did previously. Therefore, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is gloating over his capture. The use of dark lighting and the sound of a gun being pointed at Bond's chest adds to the sense of suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be subjected to further torture or harm.
