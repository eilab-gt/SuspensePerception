Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He has been tied up in a wooden armchair and is at the mercy of his captors. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's capture and imprisonment by Blofeld, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of dark lighting, the sound of a gun being pointed at Bond's chest, and the menacing tone of Blofeld's voice all contribute to a sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left feeling anxious and worried about Bond's fate, which makes the passage very suspenseful.
