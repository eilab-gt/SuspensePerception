Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He is disarmed and being searched, which doesn't bode well for his chances of escape. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond suggests that he has the upper hand, making it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation, and the description of the scene is vivid and intense. The use of words like "spidery", "unquiet", and "brusquely" adds to the sense of unease, and the fact that Bond is being disarmed and searched makes it seem like he is at the mercy of his captors. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
