Answering Question 1:

I choose option 1: Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, with a gun pointed at him and a guard instructed to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. The situation looks quite dire for Bond, making it unlikely that he will escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answering Question 2:

I choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large man contorting his face into what he might have intended as a smile", adds to the suspense. The reader is also left with a sense of uncertainty, as they are unsure of what will happen next. The passage effectively builds tension and keeps the reader engaged, making it extremely suspenseful.
