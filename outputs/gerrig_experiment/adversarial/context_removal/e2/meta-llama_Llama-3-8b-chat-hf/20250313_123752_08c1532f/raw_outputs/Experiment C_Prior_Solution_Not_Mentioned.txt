Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He has been tied up in a wooden armchair and is at the mercy of his captors. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of dark lighting, the sound of a gun being pointed at Bond's chest, and the menacing tone of Blofeld's voice all contribute to a sense of suspense and foreboding.
