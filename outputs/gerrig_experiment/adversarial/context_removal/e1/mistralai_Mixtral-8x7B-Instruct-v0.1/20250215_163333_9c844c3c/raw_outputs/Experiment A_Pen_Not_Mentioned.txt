 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we know that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. However, it is important to note that Bond is a skilled and experienced agent, so it's not impossible for him to escape. But given the current circumstances, it seems that the odds are not in his favor. Therefore, I would answer "Somewhat unlikely" for Question 1.

Question 2: As for Question 2, the passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The stakes are high, and there is a real sense of danger and uncertainty. Therefore, I would answer "Very suspenseful" for Question 2.
