 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not provide enough context about their current situation, Bond's resources, or the competence of Blofeld's guards. However, considering Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations, one might lean towards "moderately likely" or "somewhat likely."

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation as Bond is once again captured by his nemesis Blofeld and faces a dangerous guard named Crushak. The imminent threat to Bond's life and the uncertainty of the situation contribute to a sense of suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "moderately suspenseful" or "very suspenseful" depending on one's personal interpretation.
