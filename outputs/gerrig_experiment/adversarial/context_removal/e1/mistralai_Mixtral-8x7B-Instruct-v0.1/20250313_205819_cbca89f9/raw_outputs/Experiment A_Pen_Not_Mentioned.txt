 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we know that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. However, it is important to note that Bond has a history of being a resourceful and skilled agent. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as moderately likely, with a score of 5.

Question 2: Considering the danger that Bond is in, the fact that he is facing two armed gunmen, and the uncertainty about how he will escape, I would rate the suspenseful level of this passage as very suspenseful, with a score of 6.
