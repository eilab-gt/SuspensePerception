 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "moderately likely." While Bond is currently a prisoner and has been outmaneuvered by Blofeld, he has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. However, it is also possible that Bond may not be able to escape in this particular instance, so it is not a certainty.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I would rate this passage as "very suspenseful." The author has created a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond is once again pitted against a formidable adversary. The fact that Bond is currently a prisoner and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen adds to the suspense and uncertainty of the situation. The outcome is not clear, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches once again.
