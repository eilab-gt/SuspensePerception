 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we know that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. However, it is important to note that Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent, so it is not impossible for him to escape. Keeping this in mind, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely."

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and facing an uncertain fate, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "very suspenseful." The author does an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of danger for Bond, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the outcome of the situation.
