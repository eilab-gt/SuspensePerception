 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the excerpt does not provide enough context about Bond's situation or his abilities. However, considering Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, one might assume that there is a moderate chance of him escaping (Option 5).

Question 2: The passage can be considered moderately suspenseful (Option 5). The author describes a dangerous situation where Bond is held captive by a criminal figure and is at risk of being shot. The element of uncertainty about Bond's fate adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not contain any life-threatening situations or high-stakes consequences that would make it extremely suspenseful.
