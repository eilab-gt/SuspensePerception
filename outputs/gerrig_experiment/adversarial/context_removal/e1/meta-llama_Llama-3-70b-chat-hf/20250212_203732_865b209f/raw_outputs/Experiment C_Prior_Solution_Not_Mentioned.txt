***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 6: Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations, and it's likely that the author will find a way for Bond to escape from Blofeld's trap.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the "large bird crashed into the wall of glass" and "piano wire around each of the chair's corners and Bond's arms", adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Bond's escape.
