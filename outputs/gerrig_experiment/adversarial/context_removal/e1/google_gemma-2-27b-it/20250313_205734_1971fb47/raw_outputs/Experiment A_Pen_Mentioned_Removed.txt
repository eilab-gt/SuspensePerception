Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, his quick thinking in moving his pen and his determination to "do as much damage as possible" suggest he's not giving up hope. This, combined with his reputation as a resourceful agent, makes a slight chance of escape plausible.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and facing a cunning adversary. The description of Le Chiffre's actions and Bond's internal thoughts ("as if reading Bond's thoughts") creates a sense of unease and anticipation.  We're left wondering what Bond's plan is and if it will succeed.
