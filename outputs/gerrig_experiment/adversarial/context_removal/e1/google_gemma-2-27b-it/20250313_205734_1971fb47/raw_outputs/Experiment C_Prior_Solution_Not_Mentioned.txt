Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages to momentarily gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control of the situation. However, Bond is resourceful and has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations, so a slight chance of escape remains.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden interruption, and his subsequent capture. The description of Blofeld's menacing demeanor and the threat of being left alone with Crushak add to the tension.
