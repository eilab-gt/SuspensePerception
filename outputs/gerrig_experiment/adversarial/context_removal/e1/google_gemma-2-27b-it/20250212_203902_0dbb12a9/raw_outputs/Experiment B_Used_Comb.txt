Here are my answers based on the provided passage:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently overpowered and disarmed, he's James Bond. We know he's resourceful, skilled, and has a knack for getting out of tight spots.  The passage emphasizes his feeling of being "puny and impotent" which suggests a temporary setback rather than a guaranteed defeat.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a strong sense of suspense. Bond is caught off guard, outnumbered, and disarmed. Le Chiffre's calm and menacing demeanor adds to the tension. The ending line, "Bond felt puny and impotent," leaves the reader wondering what will happen next and how Bond will react.
