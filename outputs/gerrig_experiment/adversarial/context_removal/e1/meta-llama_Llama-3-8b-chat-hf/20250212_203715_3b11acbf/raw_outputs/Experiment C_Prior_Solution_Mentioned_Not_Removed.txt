Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He has been tied up in a wooden armchair, making it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has taken measures to ensure Bond's capture, such as assigning Crushak to guard him. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is gloating over his capture. The use of dark lighting, the sound of the bird crashing into the wall, and the sudden appearance of the gun pointing at Bond's chest all contribute to a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be subjected to Blofeld's wrath.
