Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught off guard and is now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being searched, which makes it unlikely that he will be able to escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and unexpected situation. Bond, who was previously confident and in control, is suddenly caught off guard and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men. The use of action words like "burst", "leapt", "guns drawn", and "twisted" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing the intensity of the situation. The fact that Bond is now a prisoner and feels "puny and impotent" adds to the sense of suspense and raises questions about how he will escape and what will happen next.
