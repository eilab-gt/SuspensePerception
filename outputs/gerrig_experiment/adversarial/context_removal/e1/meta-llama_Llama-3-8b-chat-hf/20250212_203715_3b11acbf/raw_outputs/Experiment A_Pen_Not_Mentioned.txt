Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. This does not look like a promising situation for Bond's escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond and Vesper are trapped and being searched by their captors. The use of words like "spidery", "unquiet", and "brusquely" adds to the sense of unease, and the fact that Bond is being disarmed and helpless makes the situation feel very suspenseful.
