Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has taken away his freedom and is now leaving him with Crushak to contemplate his behavior. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is in control. The use of darkness, guns, and physical restraint adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or survive his captivity. The passage also creates a sense of unease and fear, as the reader is aware that Bond is at the mercy of his captors.
