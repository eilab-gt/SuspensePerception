Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He has been tied up in a wooden armchair and is at the mercy of his captors. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes Bond's capture and imprisonment by Blofeld, which creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or not. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large bird crashing into the wall of glass", adds to the suspense and creates a sense of urgency.
