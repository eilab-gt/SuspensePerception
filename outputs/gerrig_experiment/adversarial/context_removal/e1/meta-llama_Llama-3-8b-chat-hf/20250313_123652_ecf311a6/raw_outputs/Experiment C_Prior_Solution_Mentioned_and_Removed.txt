Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair and has been warned that if he tries to speak to Crushak, he will be shot. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or help.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of dark lighting, the sound of a gun being pointed at Bond's chest, and the ominous warning from Blofeld all contribute to a sense of foreboding and suspense. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what will happen to Bond next.
