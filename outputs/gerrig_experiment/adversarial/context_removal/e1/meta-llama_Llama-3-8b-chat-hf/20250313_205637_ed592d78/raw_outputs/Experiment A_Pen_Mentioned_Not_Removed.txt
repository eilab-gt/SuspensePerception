Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, as they have him outnumbered and outgunned, and he is currently being searched and disarmed.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of the scene, including the use of words like "spidery" and "unquiet", adds to the sense of unease. The fact that Bond is being disarmed and searched, and that Le Chiffre is watching him with a cold, calculating gaze, makes it seem like Bond's chances of escape are slim.
