Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, Blofeld has already laid a successful trap for him and has a loyal gunman in Crushak who is tasked with keeping Bond captive. It's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some sort of help or clever plan.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency with Bond trying to escape from Blofeld's office, the passage is not extremely suspenseful as there is no clear indication of what will happen next or if Bond will be able to escape. The passage does a good job of building tension and creating a sense of uncertainty, but it could be more suspenseful with more cliffhangers or unexpected events.
