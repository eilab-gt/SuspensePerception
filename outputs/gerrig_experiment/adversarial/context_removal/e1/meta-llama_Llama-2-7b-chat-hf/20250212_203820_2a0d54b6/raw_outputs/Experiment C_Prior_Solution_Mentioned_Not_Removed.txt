Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, Blofeld has already laid a successful trap for him and has a gunman guarding the door. It's not clear how Bond will be able to overcome these obstacles and escape.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". While there is a sense of danger and urgency with Bond trying to escape from Blofeld's office, the passage is not extremely suspenseful as there is no clear indication of what will happen next or how Bond will manage to escape. The passage does create a sense of tension and anticipation, but it is not as intense as it could be.
