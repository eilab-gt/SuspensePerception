Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The fact that he managed to land a blow on one of the gunmen, even while being caught off guard, suggests he's not easily defeated.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, the description of Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor, and Bond's feeling of helplessness all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this dangerous situation.
