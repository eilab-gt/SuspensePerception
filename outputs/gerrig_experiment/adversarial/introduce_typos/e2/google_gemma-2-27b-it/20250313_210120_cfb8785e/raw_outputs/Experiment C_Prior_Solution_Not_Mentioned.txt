Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and manages to momentarily gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about leaving Bond "to contemplate his rude behavior" suggests he doesn't see Bond as an immediate threat, but it's unlikely Bond will remain captive indefinitely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial escape attempt, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the threat of violence. However, the outcome of the confrontation feels somewhat predetermined, lessening the overall suspense. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore any other aspects of the passage!
