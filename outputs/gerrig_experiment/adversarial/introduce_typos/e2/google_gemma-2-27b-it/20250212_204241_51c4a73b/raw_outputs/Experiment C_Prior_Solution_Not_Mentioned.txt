Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages a momentary advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control, and Crushak is presented as a formidable opponent.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the threat implied by Blofeld's words. The description of Crushak and the painful restraint add to the tension.
