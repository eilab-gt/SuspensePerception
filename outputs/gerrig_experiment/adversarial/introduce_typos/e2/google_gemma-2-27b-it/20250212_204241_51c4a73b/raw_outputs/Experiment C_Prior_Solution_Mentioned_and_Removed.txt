Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the distraction to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld's clear instructions to Crushak and the mention of the previous guard's demise suggest a heightened level of security and a willingness to use lethal force. This makes a clean escape seem unlikely, but Bond's resourcefulness and history of improbable escapes leave a sliver of hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling threats create a palpable sense of danger. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and the painful binding further heighten the suspense. The reader is left wondering if Bond can possibly find a way out of this seemingly inescapable situation.
