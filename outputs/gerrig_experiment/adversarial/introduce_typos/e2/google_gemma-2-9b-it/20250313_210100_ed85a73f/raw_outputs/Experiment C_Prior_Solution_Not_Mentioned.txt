Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and in a precarious situation, the excerpt highlights his resourcefulness and quick thinking. He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand.  Fleming's writing often suggests that Bond will find a way out, even in seemingly hopeless situations.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and the graphic description of Bond's restraint all contribute to a sense of suspense. However, it doesn't reach the level of extreme tension that might be found in a more climactic scene.
