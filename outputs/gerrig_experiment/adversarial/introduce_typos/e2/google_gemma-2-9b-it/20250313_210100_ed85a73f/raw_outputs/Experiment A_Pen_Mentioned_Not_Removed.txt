Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and at a disadvantage, the excerpt shows his quick thinking and fighting skills. He manages to disrupt Le Chiffre's plan and even briefly gain the upper hand. This suggests he's not easily defeated and will likely find a way to escape.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and facing a dangerous adversary. The descriptions of the fight, the quick movements, and Le Chiffre's menacing presence all contribute to a sense of urgency and anticipation.  We're left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
