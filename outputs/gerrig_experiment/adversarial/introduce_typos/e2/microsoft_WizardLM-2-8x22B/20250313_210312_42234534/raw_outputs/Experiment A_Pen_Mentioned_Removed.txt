1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Le Chiffre. Despite being captured and outnumbered, Bond's history of getting out of tight situations suggests that he may have a plan or the ability to improvise one.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The physical confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the precariousness of their predicament all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape with Vesper.
