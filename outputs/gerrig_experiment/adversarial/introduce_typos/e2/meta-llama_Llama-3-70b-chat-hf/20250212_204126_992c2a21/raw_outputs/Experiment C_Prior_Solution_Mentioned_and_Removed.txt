***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. Although he is currently trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it is likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the contorted face of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and danger. The threat of Bond being shot if he attempts to speak to Crushak also raises the stakes and increases the suspense.
