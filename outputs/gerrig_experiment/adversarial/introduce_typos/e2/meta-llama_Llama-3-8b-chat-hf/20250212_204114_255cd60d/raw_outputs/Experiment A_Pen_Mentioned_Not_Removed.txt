Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being held at gunpoint. It's unlikely that he will escape from this situation without some kind of plan or help.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond is in danger, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of action and violence, such as Bond's kick and the Corsican's quick reflexes, adds to the suspense. The fact that Bond is being held captive and disarmed also creates a sense of uncertainty and danger, making the reader feel like anything could happen.
