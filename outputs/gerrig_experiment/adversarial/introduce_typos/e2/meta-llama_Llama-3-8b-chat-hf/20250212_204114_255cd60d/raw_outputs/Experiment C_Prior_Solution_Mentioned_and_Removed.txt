Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is being guarded by a large and formidable man named Crushak who has orders to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. This makes it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and he is being threatened by a ruthless and formidable opponent. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly man", "contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's arms" adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
