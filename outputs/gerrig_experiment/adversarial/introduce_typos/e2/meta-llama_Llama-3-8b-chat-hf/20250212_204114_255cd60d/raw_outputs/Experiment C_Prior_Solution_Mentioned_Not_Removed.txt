Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and Gruen, and is being held captive in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and chair. This does not seem like a favorable situation for Bond to escape from.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the suspense. The reader is also left wondering what Blofeld's plan is for Bond and what will happen to Vesper, who is also a prisoner. The passage creates a sense of urgency and raises many questions, making it extremely suspenseful.
