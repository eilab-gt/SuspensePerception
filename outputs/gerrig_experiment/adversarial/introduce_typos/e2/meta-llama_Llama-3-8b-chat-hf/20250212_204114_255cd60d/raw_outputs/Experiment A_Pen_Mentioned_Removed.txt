Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and disarmed. Bond has managed to avoid serious injury so far, but he is still a prisoner and will need to come up with a plan to escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped and disarmed, and Le Chiffre is in control. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be caught. The use of action and quick movements adds to the suspense, making it feel like anything could happen at any moment.
