Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being held at gunpoint. It's unlikely that he will escape from this situation without some kind of plan or help.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and that his chances of escape are slim. The use of descriptive language, such as "With a gZXLAZ4d kick", "whistle of pain", and "crashed to the ground", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
