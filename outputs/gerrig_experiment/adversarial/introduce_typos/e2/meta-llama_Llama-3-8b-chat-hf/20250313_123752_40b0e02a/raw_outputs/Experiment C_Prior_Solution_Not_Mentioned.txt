Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and others. Bond is pinned down by piano wire and is at the mercy of his captors.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense. The reader is also left with a sense of unease and uncertainty, as they are unsure of what Blofeld's intentions are and what will happen to Bond.
