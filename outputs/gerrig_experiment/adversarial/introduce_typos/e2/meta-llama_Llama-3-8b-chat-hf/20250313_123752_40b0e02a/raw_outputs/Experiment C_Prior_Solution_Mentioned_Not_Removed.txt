Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is being guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak. Blofeld has also mentioned that Crushak is devoted to eliminating any irritations from his life, which doesn't bode well for Bond's chances of escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and he is being threatened by a ruthless and cunning villain like Blofeld. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors.
