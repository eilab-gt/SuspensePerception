***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and physically overpowered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The situation seems dire, and there is no immediate indication of a way out, making escape "not very likely" at this point.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the sudden ambush, Bond's physical struggle, and the tension created by his vulnerability and Le Chiffre's menacing control over the situation.
