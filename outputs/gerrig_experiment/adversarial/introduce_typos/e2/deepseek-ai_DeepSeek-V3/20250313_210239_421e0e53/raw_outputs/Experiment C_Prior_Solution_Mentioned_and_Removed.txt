***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tightly restrained with piano wire, and Blofeld has explicitly warned that any attempt to escape or communicate will result in Bond being shot. The situation seems dire, making escape appear "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the tension between Bond and Blofeld, the physical restraint of Bond, and the looming threat of violence. The stakes are high, and the reader is left wondering if Bond will find a way out of this perilous situation.
