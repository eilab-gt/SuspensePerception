  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from dangerous situations before, the passage suggests that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for him and that Bond is now the prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen. The passage also mentions that Bond is tied up and in pain, which makes it less likely that he will be able to escape easily.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Blofeld and his henchmen threatening Bond's life and Bond struggling to escape from his binds. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of tension create a sense of urgency and suspense, making it difficult to put the passage down.
