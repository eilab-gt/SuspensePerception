Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  the passage hints at his resourcefulness. He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand before being captured.  Bond's history suggests he's not one to give up easily.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and facing a ruthless adversary. Blofeld's threat to Bond's life and the introduction of the menacing Crushak heighten the sense of danger. The detailed description of Bond's capture and the tightening wire adds to the physical and psychological suspense.
