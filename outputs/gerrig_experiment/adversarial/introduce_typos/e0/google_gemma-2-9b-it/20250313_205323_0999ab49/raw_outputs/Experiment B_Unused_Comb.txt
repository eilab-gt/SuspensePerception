Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and disarmed, he displays his usual resourcefulness and fighting skills.  The passage emphasizes his agility and ability to recover quickly. However, he is outnumbered and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, who seems to have anticipated Bond's every move.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The sudden intrusion, the threat of violence, and Bond's initial vulnerability create a sense of tension.  The description of Le Chiffre's actions and his confident demeanor add to the suspense.  We know Bond is capable, but the situation is clearly dangerous.
