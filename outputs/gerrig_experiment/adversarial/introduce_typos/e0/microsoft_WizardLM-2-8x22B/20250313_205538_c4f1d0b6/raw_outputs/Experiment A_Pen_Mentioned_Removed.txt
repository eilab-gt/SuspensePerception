1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation, the mention of Bond's strategies to inflict damage, and the careful search for weapons all contribute to a high level of suspense, as the reader is aware of the stakes and the potential for Bond to either succeed in his attempts or face severe consequences.
