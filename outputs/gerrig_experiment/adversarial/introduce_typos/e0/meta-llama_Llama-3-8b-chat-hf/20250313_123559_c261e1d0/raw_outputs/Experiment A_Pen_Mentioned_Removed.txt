Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and outgunned, and have already disarmed him.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped and being searched, and it's unclear what will happen to him next. The use of descriptive language, such as "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's AjihA and brought a whistle of pain from him", adds to the tension and excitement of the scene.
