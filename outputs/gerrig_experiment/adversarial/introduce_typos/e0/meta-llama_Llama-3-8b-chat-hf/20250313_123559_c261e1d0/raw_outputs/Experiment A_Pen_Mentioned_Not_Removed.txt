Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being searched, which doesn't bode well for his chances of escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of action-packed language, such as "With a gZXLAZ4d kick", "Like lightning", and "he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, wondering if Bond will be able to escape or if he'll be caught.
