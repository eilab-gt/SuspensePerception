Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunman, Crushak, and is being restrained with piano wire. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and helpless against Blofeld and Crushak. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkness, and the threat of violence all contribute to a sense of high suspense.
