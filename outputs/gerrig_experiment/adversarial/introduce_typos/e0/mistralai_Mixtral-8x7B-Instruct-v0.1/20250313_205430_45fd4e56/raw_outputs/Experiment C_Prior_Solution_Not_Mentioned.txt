 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is not impossible for him to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and facing an uncertain fate. The author also describes the actions of the characters in a way that builds tension, such as the moment when Bond tries to escape and is confronted by the large and ugly man named Crushak. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
