 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history and expertise as a secret agent, it is not impossible for him to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and facing an uncertain future. The fact that Bond has been in this situation before and managed to escape adds to the suspense, as the reader wonders whether he will be able to do so again. Additionally, the introduction of a new and formidable character, Mr. Crushak, adds to the tension and uncertainty. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
