***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tightly restrained with piano wire, and Blofeld has explicitly warned that any attempt to escape or communicate will result in Bond being shot. The situation seems dire, making escape appear "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the tension created by Bond's capture, the threat of violence, and the uncertainty of whether he can find a way out of this perilous situation.
