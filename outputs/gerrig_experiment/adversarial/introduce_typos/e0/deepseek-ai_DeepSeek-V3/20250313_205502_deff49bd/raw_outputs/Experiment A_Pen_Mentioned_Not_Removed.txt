1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under the control of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His attempt to fight back was quickly neutralized, and he is now being thoroughly searched. The situation seems dire, making escape seem "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the tension of Bond's failed attempt to fight back, the immediate threat posed by Le Chiffre and his men, and the uncertainty of what will happen next. The detailed action and Bond's precarious position heighten the suspense.
