***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under the control of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The situation seems dire, and there is no immediate indication of an escape route or assistance. Thus, it is not very likely that Bond will escape at this moment.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is very suspenseful due to the sudden ambush, Bond's physical struggle, and the tension created by his vulnerability and Le Chiffre's control over the situation. The uncertainty of Bond's fate adds to the suspense.
