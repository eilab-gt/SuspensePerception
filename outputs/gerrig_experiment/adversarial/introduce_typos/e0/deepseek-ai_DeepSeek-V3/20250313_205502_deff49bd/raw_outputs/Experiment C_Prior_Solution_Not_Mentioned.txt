***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
5. Moderately suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1:** Bond is currently tied up with piano wire and under the control of Blofeld and his henchman, Mr. Crushak. The situation seems dire, and there is no immediate indication of an escape route or opportunity. Thus, it is not very likely that Bond will escape at this moment.  
- **Question 2:** The passage is moderately suspenseful due to the tension created by Bond's failed attempt to escape, the introduction of the intimidating Mr. Crushak, and the painful binding of Bond with piano wire. However, the suspense is not at its peak since Bond is already captured and the immediate threat is somewhat contained.
