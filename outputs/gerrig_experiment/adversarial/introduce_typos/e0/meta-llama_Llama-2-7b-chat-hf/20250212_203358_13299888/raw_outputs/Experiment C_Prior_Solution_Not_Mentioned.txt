  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from dangerous situations before, the passage suggests that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for him and that he is now the prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen. It is unclear how Bond will manage to escape from this predicament.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen, and is being subjected to physical pain and discomfort. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of tension create a sense of urgency and suspense, making it difficult to put the passage down.
