  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Moderately likely. While Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, the situation seems more dire this time around, with Bond being tied up and surrounded by two gunmen. However, Bond is a resourceful and skilled agent, so there is always a chance that he could find a way out of this predicament.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The sudden appearance of the bird crashing into the wall of glass, followed by Bond's quick thinking to pull up the rug and create a distraction, adds to the tension and suspense of the scene. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen, with no clear way out, makes for a thrilling and suspenseful read.
