Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped and disarmed, and Le Chiffre has the upper hand. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his captors, especially since they are well-armed and have the advantage of surprise.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and intense situation. Bond is caught off guard and is being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The use of action verbs like "burst", "leapt", "twisted", and "crashed" creates a sense of urgency and chaos. The fact that Bond is trapped and disarmed adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
