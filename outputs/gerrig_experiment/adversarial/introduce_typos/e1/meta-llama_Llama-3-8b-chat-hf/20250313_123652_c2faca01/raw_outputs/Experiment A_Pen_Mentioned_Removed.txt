Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and disarmed. Bond has managed to avoid serious injury so far, but he is still a prisoner and has no clear plan for escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped and disarmed, and Le Chiffre is in control. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors. The use of vivid language and the rapid pace of the action also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
