Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he's being guarded by a large and formidable man named Crushak who has orders to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. This doesn't look like a promising situation for Bond's escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation for Bond. He's trapped, injured, and being guarded by a ruthless and formidable opponent. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "ugly man" and the "painfully" twisted piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive the situation.
