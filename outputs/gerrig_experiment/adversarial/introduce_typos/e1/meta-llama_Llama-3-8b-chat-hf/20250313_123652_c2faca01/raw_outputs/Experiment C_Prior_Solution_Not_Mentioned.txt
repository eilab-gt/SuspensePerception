Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. Bond is also physically restrained by the piano wire wrapped around the chair's corners and his arms, making it difficult for him to escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and the description of the situation is vivid and intense. The use of words like "crashed", "stumbled", and "knocking out" creates a sense of chaos and unpredictability, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is in physical pain adds to the suspense, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond
