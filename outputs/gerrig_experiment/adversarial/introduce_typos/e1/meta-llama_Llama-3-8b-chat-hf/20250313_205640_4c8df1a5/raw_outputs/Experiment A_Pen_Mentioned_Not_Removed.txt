Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it's a tense and intense situation. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of action verbs like "slammed", "whistled", "crashed", and "twisted" creates a sense of urgency and chaos, making it hard to put the story down. The fact that Bond is being captured and disarmed adds to the suspense, making the reader feel like anything could happen at any moment.
