Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and Gruen, and is being held captive in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and chair. This makes it unlikely that he will escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what will happen to Bond next.
