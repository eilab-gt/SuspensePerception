Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been caught off guard and is now at the mercy of his captors. Given the circumstances, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is in a desperate situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of action-packed language, such as "With a backward kick... Bond hurled himself down the passage after her" and "he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand", adds to the suspense. The reader is also left wondering what Le Chiffre's intentions are, which adds to the tension. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
