Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being held at gunpoint. It's unlikely that he will escape from this situation without some kind of plan or help.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and that his chances of escape are slim. The use of action and violence, such as Bond's kick and the Corsican's quick reflexes, adds to the suspense. The reader is also left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will manage to escape or get out of the situation.
