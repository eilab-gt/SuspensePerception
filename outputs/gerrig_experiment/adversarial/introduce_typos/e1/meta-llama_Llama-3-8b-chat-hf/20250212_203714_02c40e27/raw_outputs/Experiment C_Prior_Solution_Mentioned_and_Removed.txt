Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is being guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak who has orders to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. This makes it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and is being threatened by a ruthless and powerful villain. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "very large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability, as it is unclear what will happen to Bond next.
