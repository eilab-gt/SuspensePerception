Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is facing a large and ugly man, Crushak, who is devoted to eliminating any irritations from Blofeld's life. Additionally, Blofeld has a history of eliminating people who have previously held Bond captive, including the guard who died in an automobile accident. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches.
