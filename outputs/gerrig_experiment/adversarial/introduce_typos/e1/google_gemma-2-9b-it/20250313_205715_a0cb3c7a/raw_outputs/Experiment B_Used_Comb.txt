Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to briefly fight back and evade capture completely.  It's not impossible for him to find a way out, but the odds are stacked against him.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is caught off guard, overpowered, and stripped of his weapon.  Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and the detail about the comb being thrown out of reach add to the feeling that Bond is in a precarious position.
