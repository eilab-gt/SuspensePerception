Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and in a precarious situation, the excerpt highlights his resourcefulness and quick thinking. He managed to use a distraction to his advantage, even if it was temporary.  Bond's history of escaping seemingly impossible situations suggests he won't go down without a fight.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and facing a ruthless adversary in Blofeld. The description of Crushak's menacing presence and the painful tightening of the wire adds to the suspense. However, it's not yet at a point of extreme, heart-pounding suspense.
