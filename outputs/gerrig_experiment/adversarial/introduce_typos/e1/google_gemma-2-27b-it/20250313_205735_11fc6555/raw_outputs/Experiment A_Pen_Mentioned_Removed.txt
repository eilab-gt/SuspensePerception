Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and disarmed. Le Chiffre seems to be in control of the situation.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and disarmed. The descriptions of Le Chiffre's actions and the quick, violent exchange add to the suspense.  We're left wondering what Le Chiffre's plan is and whether Bond can find a way out.
