Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and manages to momentarily gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about leaving Bond "to contemplate his rude behavior" suggests he doesn't see Bond as an immediate threat, but it's unlikely Bond will remain captive indefinitely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial escape attempt, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the threat implied by Blofeld's words. The description of Crushak and the painful binding add to the tension. However, the passage lacks a clear sense of imminent danger or a ticking clock, which would elevate the suspense further.
