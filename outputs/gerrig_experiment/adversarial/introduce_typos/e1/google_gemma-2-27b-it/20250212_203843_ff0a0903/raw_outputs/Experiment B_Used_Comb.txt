Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The fact that he managed to land a blow on one of the gunmen, even while being caught off guard, suggests he's not easily defeated.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a strong sense of danger and uncertainty. Bond is suddenly attacked, overpowered, and disarmed. Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and the detail about the comb being taken away add to the feeling of menace. The ending line, "Let's not waste time," implies that something unpleasant is about to happen.
