Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the distraction to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld's clear instructions to Crushak and the threat of immediate death make a successful escape seem difficult, but not impossible given Bond's history.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling threat create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering if Bond can find a way out of this seemingly inescapable situation.
