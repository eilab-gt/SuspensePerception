Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about his previous guard dying suggests a pattern of Bond escaping and guards meeting unfortunate ends. This implies Bond is resourceful, but Blofeld is prepared for his tricks.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's initial escape attempt is thwarted, and he's bound painfully. Blofeld's calm demeanor and mention of the previous guard's death create a sense of danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate. The introduction of the menacing Crushak adds to the suspense.
