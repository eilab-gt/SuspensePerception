 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is in a challenging and precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has shown resourcefulness and resilience throughout the story. Considering this, I would answer "moderately likely" for the question "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond being captured and his escape attempts thwarted. The potential danger and uncertainty involved in this scenario contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would answer "very suspenseful" for the question "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
