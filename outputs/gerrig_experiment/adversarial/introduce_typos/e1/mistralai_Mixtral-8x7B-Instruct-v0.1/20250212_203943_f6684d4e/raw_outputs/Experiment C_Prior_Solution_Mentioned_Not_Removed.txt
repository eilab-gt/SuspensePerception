 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, it is not impossible for him to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and facing an uncertain future. The fact that Bond has managed to escape from similar situations in the past adds to the suspense, as the reader wonders whether he will be able to do so again. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
