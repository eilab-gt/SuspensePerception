 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is not impossible for him to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being held captive and facing an uncertain fate. The fact that Bond is able to momentarily distract Blofeld and make a move towards the door, only to be confronted by another gunman, adds to the tension. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
