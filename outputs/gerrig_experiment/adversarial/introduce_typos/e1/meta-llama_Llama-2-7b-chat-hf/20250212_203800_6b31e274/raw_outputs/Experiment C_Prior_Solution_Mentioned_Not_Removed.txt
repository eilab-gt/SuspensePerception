  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, the situation seems more dire this time around, with Bond being tied up and surrounded by two gunmen. It's unclear what Bond's plan of action is or how he will manage to escape.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The use of sensory details, such as the sound of the bird crashing into the wall of glass, and the darkness of the office after the light goes out, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is trapped and surrounded by gunmen adds to the suspense, making it unclear what will happen next.
