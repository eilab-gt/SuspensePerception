  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to create a distraction and try to escape, he is still restrained by the piano wire and is at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. It is unclear at this point in the passage whether Bond will be able to find a way to escape or if he will be able to outsmart Blofeld.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of tension create a sense of urgency and suspense, making it difficult to predict what will happen next.
