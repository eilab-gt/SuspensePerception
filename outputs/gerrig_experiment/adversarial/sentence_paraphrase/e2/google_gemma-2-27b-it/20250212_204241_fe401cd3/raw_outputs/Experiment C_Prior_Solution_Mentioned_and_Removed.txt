Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld's clear threat and the presence of the intimidating Crushak make a clean escape seem unlikely. However, Bond's history of cunning and resilience suggests he might find a way out, even if it's not straightforward.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling threat create a palpable sense of danger. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and the painful binding further heighten the suspense.
