Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about Crushak being "devoted to eliminating such irritations" suggests a formidable opponent. However, this is a James Bond story, and Bond's resourcefulness and determination should not be underestimated.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, and he is bound tightly by Crushak. Blofeld's menacing tone and the mention of the previous guard's demise add to the suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will possibly overcome this seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
