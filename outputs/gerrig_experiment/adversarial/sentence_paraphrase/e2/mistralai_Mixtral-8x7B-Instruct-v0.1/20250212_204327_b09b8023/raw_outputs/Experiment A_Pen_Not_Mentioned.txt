 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "somewhat likely" (2).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being captured and attempting to escape. The uncertainty of the outcome and the immediate danger posed to Bond contribute to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as "very suspenseful" (6).
