 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has already shown some resourcefulness in trying to escape and reach Vesper. Considering Bond's skills and past experiences, there is a possibility that he might find a way to escape. However, at this point in the narrative, it is still uncertain. So, I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense scene where Bond is trying to escape and Vesper has been taken away. The uncertainty about their fate and the immediate danger they are in does create a sense of suspense. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
