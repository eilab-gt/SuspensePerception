 Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond's history with Blofeld, and the current situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Blofeld has clearly anticipated Bond's moves and has a formidable guard in Crushak, Bond has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author does an excellent job of building tension through the use of descriptive language and the depiction of Bond's predicament. The fact that Bond has been captured before and managed to escape adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering if he will be able to do so again. Additionally, the introduction of the character Crushak and the description of the piano wire used to bind Bond serve to heighten the stakes and increase the sense of danger.
