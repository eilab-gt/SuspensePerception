 Answer Question 1: Based on the details provided in the passage, Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen with limited means of escape. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld in the immediate future. I would select option 1, "Not very likely".

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond is at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The power dynamic between Bond and Blofeld is clear, and the use of force against Bond adds to the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond is in a vulnerable position and outnumbered creates a sense of uncertainty about what will happen next. Therefore, I would select option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
