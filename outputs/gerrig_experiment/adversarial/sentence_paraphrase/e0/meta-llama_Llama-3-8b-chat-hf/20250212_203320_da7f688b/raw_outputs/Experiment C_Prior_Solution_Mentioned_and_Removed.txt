Answering the questions based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is now a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, with Bond being tied up in a chair and Crushak having orders to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, with no clear way for him to escape. The description of the setting, the characters' actions, and the threats made by Blofeld and Crushak all contribute to a sense of suspense and foreboding.
