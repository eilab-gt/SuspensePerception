Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control, and Crushak appears to be a formidable opponent.  Escape doesn't seem impossible, given Bond's resourcefulness, but it's definitely an uphill battle.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, and he's left bound and at the mercy of Blofeld and the menacing Crushak. The description of Crushak's appearance and actions adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty.
