 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) as an answer.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being captured and attempting to escape. The fact that Bond's escape plan fails and he is subsequently searched for weapons adds to the tension. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as "very suspenseful" (6).
