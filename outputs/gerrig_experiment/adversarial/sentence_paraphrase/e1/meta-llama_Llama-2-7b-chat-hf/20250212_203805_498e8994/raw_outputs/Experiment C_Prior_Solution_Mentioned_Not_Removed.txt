  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, there is no guarantee that he will be able to do so again. Blofeld seems to have taken precautions to ensure Bond's capture, and Bond's current situation appears to be quite dire.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of suspense create a sense of urgency and fear for Bond's safety, making the passage very suspenseful.
