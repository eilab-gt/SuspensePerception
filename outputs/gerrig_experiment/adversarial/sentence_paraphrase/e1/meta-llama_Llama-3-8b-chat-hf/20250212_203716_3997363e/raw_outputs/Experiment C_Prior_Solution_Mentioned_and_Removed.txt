Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a chair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Crushak has been instructed to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to him, which further limits Bond's options. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The description of the setting, including the dark office and the large and ugly Crushak, adds to the sense of foreboding. The threat of violence and the possibility of Bond's death are also present, which makes the passage even more suspenseful. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
