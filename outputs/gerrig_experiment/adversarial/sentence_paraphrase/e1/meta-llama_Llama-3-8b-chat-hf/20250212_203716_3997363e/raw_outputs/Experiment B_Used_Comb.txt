Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught off guard and is now trapped, with no clear means of escape. He has been disarmed and his comb, which he was using to smooth his hair, has been taken away from him. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of tension and danger from the very beginning. The sudden burst of the door and the appearance of the three men with guns drawn creates a sense of shock and surprise. The fact that Bond is caught off guard and is unable to defend himself adds to the sense of suspense. The description of Bond's feelings of puniness and impotence also adds to the sense of tension and foreboding, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
