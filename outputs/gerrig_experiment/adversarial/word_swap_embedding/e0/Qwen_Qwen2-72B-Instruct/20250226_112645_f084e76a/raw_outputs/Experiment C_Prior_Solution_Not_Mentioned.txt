***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond is currently restrained and under the watch of Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, which suggests that his chances of escape are not very high. However, given Bond's history of resourcefulness and the unpredictable nature of the situation, it is also not certain that he will not escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes involved and the uncertainty of Bond's fate. Bond is in a precarious situation, having been captured by his enemy, and the description of his restraint and the presence of Crushak create a sense of imminent danger. The potential for violence and the unknown outcome contribute to the overall suspense of the passage
