***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured and is being guarded by Crushak, who is described as large and ugly, and has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak. However, Bond has a history of escaping from dangerous situations, which leaves the outcome uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's capture and the immediate threat to his life. The tension is heightened by the description of Crushak's orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak, and the painful method of restraining Bond with piano wire. The uncertainty of Bond's fate adds to the suspense.
