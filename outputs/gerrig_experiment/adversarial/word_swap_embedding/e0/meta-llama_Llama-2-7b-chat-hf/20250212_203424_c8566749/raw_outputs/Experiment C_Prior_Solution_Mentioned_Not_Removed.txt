  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Moderately likely. While Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's trap before, the situation this time seems more dire, with Bond being tied up and surrounded by Blofeld's gunmen. However, Bond is a resourceful and skilled agent, so there is always a chance he could find a way out.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld's gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of suspense create a sense of urgency and fear for Bond's safety, making the passage very suspenseful.
