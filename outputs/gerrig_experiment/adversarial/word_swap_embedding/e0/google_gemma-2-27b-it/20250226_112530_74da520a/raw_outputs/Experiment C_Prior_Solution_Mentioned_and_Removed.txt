Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently bound and under guard, he has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations. The fact that he managed to briefly create a distraction and injure Blofeld suggests he's still thinking strategically.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, threatened with death, and bound tightly. The introduction of the menacing Crushak and Blofeld's cold demeanor create a palpable sense of danger.  The reader is left wondering how Bond will possibly get out of this situation.
