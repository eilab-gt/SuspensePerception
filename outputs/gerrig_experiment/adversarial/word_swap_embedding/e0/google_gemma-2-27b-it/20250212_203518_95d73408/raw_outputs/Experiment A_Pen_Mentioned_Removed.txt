Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and is actively taking away Bond's means of defense.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and disarmed. The descriptions of Le Chiffre's actions and the quick, violent movements create a sense of urgency and danger.
