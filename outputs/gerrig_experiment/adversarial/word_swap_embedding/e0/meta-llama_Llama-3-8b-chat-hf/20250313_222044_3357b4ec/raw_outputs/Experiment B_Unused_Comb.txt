Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, with no clear escape route. He is disarmed and at the mercy of his captors, making it unlikely that he will escape without a dramatic turn of events.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The sudden explosion of the door, the appearance of the gunmen, and Bond's capture all contribute to a sense of urgency and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
