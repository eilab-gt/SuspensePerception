Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, being prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The fact that they are being led downstairs and are being searched for weapons suggests that they are at a disadvantage. It's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape easily from this situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a difficult situation, and the description of the scene is vivid and intense. The use of words like "brutally", "hissing", "pain", and "delicately" adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
