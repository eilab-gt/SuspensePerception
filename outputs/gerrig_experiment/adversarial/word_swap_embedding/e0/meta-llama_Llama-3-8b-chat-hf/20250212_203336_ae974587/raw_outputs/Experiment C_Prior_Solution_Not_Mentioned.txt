Answering the questions based on the passage:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of intervention or clever plan.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tension and suspense, with Bond being trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's menacing tone and actions creating a sense of danger and uncertainty. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and raises the stakes for Bond's escape.
