Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has mentioned that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, implying that Bond is in grave danger. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's words and actions suggest that he intends to harm Bond. The description of Crushak's ugly face and his contorted smile adds to the sense of unease, and the use of words like "irritations" and "eliminating" implies a sense of menace. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia, as Bond is trapped in a small, dark room with no clear way to escape. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of suspense and tension.
