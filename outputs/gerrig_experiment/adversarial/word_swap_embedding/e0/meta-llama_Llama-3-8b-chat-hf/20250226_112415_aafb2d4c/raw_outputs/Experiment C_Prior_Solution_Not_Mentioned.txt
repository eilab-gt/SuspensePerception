Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and pinned down by piano wire. Blofeld has the upper hand, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or help.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and Blofeld is in control. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" man, adds to the sense of unease. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be harmed.
