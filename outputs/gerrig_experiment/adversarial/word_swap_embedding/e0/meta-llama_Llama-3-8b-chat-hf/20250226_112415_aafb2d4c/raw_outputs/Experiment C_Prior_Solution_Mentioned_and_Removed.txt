Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained with piano wire. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and helpless, and the threat of death hanging over him. The description of Crushak's gruesome appearance and Blofeld's sinister intentions adds to the sense of unease and fear. The use of vivid language and the rapid pace of the events also contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere.
