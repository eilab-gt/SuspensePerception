Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by piano wire. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being restrained, and Blofeld is threatening to eliminate him. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "vast and very ugly" man Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape, which keeps the reader engaged and invested in the story.
