1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The narrative suggests that Bond is already planning his next move and has managed to conceal a potential weapon (his fountain pen), indicating that he is preparing for an opportunity to fight back or escape.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and violent confrontation where Bond is outnumbered and captured. The detailed description of the action, the imminent threat posed by the gunmen, and the uncertainty of Bond's situation create a sense of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and concerned about Bond's fate, wondering how he will manage to overcome the odds and escape from Le Chiffre's clutches.
