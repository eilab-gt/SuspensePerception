1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's history and his reputation for escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld. The description of the scene suggests that Bond is already looking for opportunities to turn the situation to his advantage, which is typical of his character.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of their captors. The use of descriptive language and the sudden interruption by the large bird create a sense of unpredictability and danger, which adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen next, which are classic elements of a suspenseful narrative.
