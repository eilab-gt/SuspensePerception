1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is outnumbered and captured, yet he attempts a daring maneuver to pursue Vesper and potentially communicate with her. The physical confrontation and the mention of Bond subtly positioning his pen for potential use increase the suspense, as readers are aware of Bond's capabilities and the likelihood of an impending escape attempt or confrontation.
