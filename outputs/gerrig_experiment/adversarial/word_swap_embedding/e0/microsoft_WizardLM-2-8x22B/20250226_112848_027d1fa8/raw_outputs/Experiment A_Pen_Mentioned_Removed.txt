1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Le Chiffre. Despite being captured and outnumbered, Bond's history of getting out of tight situations suggests that he may have a plan or the ability to improvise one.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the mention of Le Chiffre's intent to not waste time all contribute to a high level of suspense. Readers are likely to be engaged and concerned about the outcome of this encounter, wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen to him and Vesper next.
