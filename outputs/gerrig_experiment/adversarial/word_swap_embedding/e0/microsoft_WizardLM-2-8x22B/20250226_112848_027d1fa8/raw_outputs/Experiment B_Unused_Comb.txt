1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness and past history of escaping from difficult situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. His quick reaction to the attack in his hotel room and his ability to remain unharmed despite being outnumbered suggest that he has the skills and presence of mind to create an opportunity for escape.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events where Bond, who was previously confident and in control, finds himself ambushed and at the mercy of his enemies. The detailed description of the confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the thorough search by Le Chiffre's henchmen all contribute to a tense atmosphere that keeps the reader engaged and wondering how Bond will manage to extricate himself from this precarious situation.
