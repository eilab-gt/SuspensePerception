Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and disarmed, he displays his usual resourcefulness and fighting skills.  The passage emphasizes Bond's agility and pride in his ability to recover quickly.  This suggests he won't go down without a fight and might find a way to turn the situation around.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence shattered as he's ambushed. The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's menacing actions create a sense of danger and uncertainty.  We're left wondering how Bond will escape this predicament.
