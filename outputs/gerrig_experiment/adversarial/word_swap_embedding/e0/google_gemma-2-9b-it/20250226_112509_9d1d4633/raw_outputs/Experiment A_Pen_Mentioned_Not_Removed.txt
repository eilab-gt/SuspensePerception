Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond shows quick thinking and agility, he's clearly outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control, and Bond's attempt to intervene was quickly thwarted.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The description of the physical struggle and Le Chiffre's watchful eye adds to the suspense.
