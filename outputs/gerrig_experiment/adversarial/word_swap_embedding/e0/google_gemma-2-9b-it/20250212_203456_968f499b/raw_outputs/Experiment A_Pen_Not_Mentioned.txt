Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Explanation:** While Bond shows his usual agility and fighting spirit, he's clearly outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and has already anticipated Bond's attempt to intervene.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Explanation:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond's quick action and the description of the fight create a sense of immediacy. We know he's in danger, and the outcome is uncertain.
