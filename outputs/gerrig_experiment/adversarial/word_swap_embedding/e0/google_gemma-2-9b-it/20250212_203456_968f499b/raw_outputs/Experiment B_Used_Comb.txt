Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to evade the gunmen initially and even landed a blow on one.  However, he's disarmed and outnumbered, suggesting escape won't be easy.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's menacing smile create a sense of impending danger.  We know Bond is in trouble, but his fate remains uncertain, keeping the reader on edge.
