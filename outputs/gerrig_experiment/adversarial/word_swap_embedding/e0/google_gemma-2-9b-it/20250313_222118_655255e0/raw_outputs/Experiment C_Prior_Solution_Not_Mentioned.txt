Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and bound, the excerpt hints at his resourcefulness. He quickly takes advantage of a distraction and shows a willingness to fight back.  Fleming's writing often portrays Bond as a survivor, so a complete escape isn't out of the question.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Blofeld and his menacing henchman. The description of the binding and Blofeld's threats add to the tension. However, it lacks the immediate, heart-pounding action that would make it extremely suspenseful
