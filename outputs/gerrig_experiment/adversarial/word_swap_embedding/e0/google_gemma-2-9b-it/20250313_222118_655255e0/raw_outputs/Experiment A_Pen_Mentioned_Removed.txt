Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, the excerpt hints at his resourcefulness and fighting skills. He manages to briefly resist Le Chiffre's men and seems to be thinking strategically.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension with Bond being captured and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The descriptions of the struggle and Le Chiffre's menacing tone add to the suspense. However, it lacks the visceral detail or cliffhanger ending that would make it extremely suspenseful.
