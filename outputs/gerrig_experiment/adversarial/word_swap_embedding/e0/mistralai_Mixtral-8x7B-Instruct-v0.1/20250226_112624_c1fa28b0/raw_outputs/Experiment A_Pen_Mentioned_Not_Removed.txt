 Answer Question 1: Based on the excerpt, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation as he has been captured by Le Chiffre and his men. However, Bond does attempt to escape and shows some resourcefulness, so it's not impossible that he might find a way out. A neutral or uncertain answer might be the most appropriate in this case, as there isn't enough information to make a definitive judgment. So, the answer would be "4. Neutral or Uncertain".

Answer Question 2: The excerpt describes a tense scene where Bond is trying to escape and Le Chiffre's men are trying to stop him. This creates a sense of suspense as the outcome is uncertain. Therefore, the answer would be "5. Moderately suspenseful".
