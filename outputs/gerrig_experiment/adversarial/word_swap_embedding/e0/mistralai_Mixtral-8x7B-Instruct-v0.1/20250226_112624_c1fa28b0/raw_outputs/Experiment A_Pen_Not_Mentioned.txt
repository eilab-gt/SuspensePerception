 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre, as it depends on the events that follow. However, given Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "very likely" (6), understanding that there are risks and challenges involved.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond has been captured and is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, with a rescue or escape plan yet to be revealed, the passage can be described as "very suspenseful" (6). The tension is high, and the reader is eager to find out what happens next.
