 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen after his escape attempt was unsuccessful. However, Bond is a skilled and experienced agent, so it's possible that he could come up with another plan to escape. Overall, I would say that it is somewhat likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. The author does a good job of building tension as Bond tries to escape and is then caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which adds to the suspense. However, I would not call it extremely suspenseful because the passage is relatively short, and there is not enough information provided about what will happen next.
