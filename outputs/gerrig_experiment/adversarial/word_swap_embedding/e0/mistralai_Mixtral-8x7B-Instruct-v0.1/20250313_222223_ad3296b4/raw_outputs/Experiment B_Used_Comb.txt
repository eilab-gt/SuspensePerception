 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we cannot objectively determine the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the passage does not provide enough information about the situation or Bond's plans.

Question 2: Considering the fact that James Bond, a well-known secret agent, has been trapped by a criminal figure with two gunmen, and the scene describes a tense situation with potential harm to Bond, I would rate the suspense as a 6, "Very suspenseful".
