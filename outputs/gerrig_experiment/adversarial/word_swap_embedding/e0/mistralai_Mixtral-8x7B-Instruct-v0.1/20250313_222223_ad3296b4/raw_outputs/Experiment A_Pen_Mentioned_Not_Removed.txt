 Question 1: Based on the passage provided, it seems that Bond is in a challenging and dangerous situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has already shown his resourcefulness and combat skills in this passage, so it is possible that he could find a way to escape. I would rate the likelihood as moderately likely (5).
