 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his men. However, considering Bond's skills and experiences, it's difficult to definitively determine his likelihood of escaping. But given the context, I would lean towards "somewhat likely" (2) as an answer, as Bond has proven his resourcefulness in the past.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, this passage is quite engaging. Bond, who was previously on top, has been captured and is at the mercy of his enemy. This sudden reversal of fortune creates a sense of tension and suspense. Therefore, I would rate it as "very suspenseful" (6).
