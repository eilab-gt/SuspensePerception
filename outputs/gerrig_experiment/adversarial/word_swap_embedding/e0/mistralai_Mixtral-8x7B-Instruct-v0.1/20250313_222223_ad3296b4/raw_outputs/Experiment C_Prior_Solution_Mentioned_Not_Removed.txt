 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his men, and they are taking measures to ensure he can't escape, such as tying him up with wire. However, Bond has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations, so it's difficult to say for certain. I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely," but it really depends on the specific events that occur in the story.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being held captive and in danger of being killed. The use of descriptive language and the ominous tone of Blofeld's words add to the suspense. I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "very suspenseful."
