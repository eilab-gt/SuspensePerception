 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and Le Chiffre is taking precautions to ensure that Bond is disarmed and unable to escape. Therefore, it seems that it might not be very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point in time. So, I would answer "Not very likely" for Question 1.

Answer Question 2: As for Question 2, suspense is often created when there is uncertainty about the outcome of a situation, and when the stakes are high. In this passage, Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader may feel uncertain about whether he will be able to escape or not. Additionally, the fact that Bond is a beloved and well-known character, and that the novel is a spy thriller, may contribute to the suspense. Therefore, I would answer "Moderately suspenseful" for Question 2.
