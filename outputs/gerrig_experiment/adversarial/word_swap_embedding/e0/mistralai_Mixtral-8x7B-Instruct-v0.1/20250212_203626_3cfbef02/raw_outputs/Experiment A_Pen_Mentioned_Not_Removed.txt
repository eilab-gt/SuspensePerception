 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Although Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, it is unclear if he will have an opportunity to escape or overpower his captors. Therefore, I would answer "Neutral or Uncertain" for this question.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond has been captured and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The use of descriptive language and the sense of urgency conveyed in the passage contribute to a sense of suspense. Therefore, I would answer "Moderately suspenseful" for this question.
