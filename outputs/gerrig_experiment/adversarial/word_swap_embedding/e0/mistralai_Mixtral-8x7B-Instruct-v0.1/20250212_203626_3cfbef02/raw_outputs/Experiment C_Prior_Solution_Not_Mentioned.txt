 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Blofeld and his men. Bond did manage to momentarily distract them, but he still ended up being tied to a chair. Given this information, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely" (2). While it's clear that Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, the text does not provide any details about how he might escape from his current situation.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being held captive by a dangerous enemy. The author also describes Blofeld as having a "good friend" named Mr. Crushak, who seems to be a formidable and menacing character. This element of danger adds to the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond's fate is left uncertain by the end of the passage creates a sense of anticipation. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "moderately suspenseful" (5).
