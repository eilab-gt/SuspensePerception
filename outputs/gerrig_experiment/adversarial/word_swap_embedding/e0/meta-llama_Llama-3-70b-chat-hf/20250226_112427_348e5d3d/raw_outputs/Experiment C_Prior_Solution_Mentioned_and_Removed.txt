***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his cunning and ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because Bond is in a life-or-death situation, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The addition of details like the painful piano wire and the gruesome appearance of Crushak adds to the tension, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing his fear and anxiety. The fact that Bond is not even allowed to speak without risking being shot adds to the sense of urgency and danger.
