***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tied up and under the control of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The situation seems dire, and there is no immediate indication of an escape route or opportunity. Thus, it is not very likely that Bond will escape at this moment.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes situation, the tension between Bond and Blofeld, and the physical restraint of Bond. The uncertainty of what will happen next adds to the suspense.
