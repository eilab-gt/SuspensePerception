1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under close surveillance by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His attempts to resist have been thwarted, and he has no obvious means of escape at this moment. Thus, it is "Not very likely" that he will escape.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the tense confrontation, Bond's failed attempt to fight back, and the uncertainty of what Le Chiffre plans to do next. The stakes are high, and the situation feels precarious, making it "Very suspenseful."
