***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond is currently restrained and under the watch of Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, which suggests that his chances of escape are not high. However, given Bond's history of resourcefulness and the unpredictable nature of the situation, it is impossible to definitively assess the probability of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and uncertainty, which are key elements of suspense. Bond's precarious situation, having been captured and tied up by his enemy, creates a sense of danger and anticipation. The reader is left wondering how Bond will extricate himself from this perilous position, if at all, which heightens the suspense.
