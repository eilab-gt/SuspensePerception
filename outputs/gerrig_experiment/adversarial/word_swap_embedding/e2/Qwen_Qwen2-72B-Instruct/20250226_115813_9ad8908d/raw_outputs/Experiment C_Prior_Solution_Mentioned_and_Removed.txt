***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured and is being tied up by Crushak, but given Bond's history of escaping from dangerous situations, it is neither certain that he will escape nor that he will not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a critical moment where Bond's life is in immediate danger. He has been captured by Blofeld, who has a history of violence, and is being tied up by Crushak, who is described as a large and ugly man with orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak. The tension is heightened by the fact that Bond is a character known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from perilous situations
