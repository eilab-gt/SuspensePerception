Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently bound and at a disadvantage, the excerpt highlights his resourcefulness and quick thinking. He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand before being subdued.  Fleming's writing often emphasizes Bond's ability to improvise and escape seemingly impossible situations.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and the graphic description of Bond's binding create a sense of danger and uncertainty.  We know Bond is in a precarious position, but his history of survival suggests he might find a way out. 


Let me know if you'd like to discuss any other aspects of the passage!
