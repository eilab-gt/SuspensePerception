Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

While Bond shows quick thinking and agility, he's clearly outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and has already disarmed Bond.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond's attempt to rescue Vesper is thwarted, and he's now at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men. The description of the physical struggle and Le Chiffre's watchful eye adds to the suspense.
