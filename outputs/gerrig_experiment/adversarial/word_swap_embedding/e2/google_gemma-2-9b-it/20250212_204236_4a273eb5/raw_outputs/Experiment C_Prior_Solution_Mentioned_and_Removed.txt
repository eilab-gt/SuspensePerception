Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown time and again to be resourceful and capable of escaping seemingly impossible situations.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, he's physically restrained, and Blofeld's threat against Bond's life adds a significant layer of danger.  


Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further!
