Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past.  The excerpt hints at his potential for escape, even if it's not immediately clear how he'll do it.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape is thwarted, and the introduction of the menacing Crushak and the painful wire restraints create a sense of danger and uncertainty.
