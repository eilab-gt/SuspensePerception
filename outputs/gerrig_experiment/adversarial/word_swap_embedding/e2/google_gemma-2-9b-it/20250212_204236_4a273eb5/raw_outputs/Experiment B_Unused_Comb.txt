Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly outmatched at this moment, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to evade the gunmen initially and likely has a plan brewing.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's smug demeanor create a sense of impending danger.  We know Bond is in trouble, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape.
