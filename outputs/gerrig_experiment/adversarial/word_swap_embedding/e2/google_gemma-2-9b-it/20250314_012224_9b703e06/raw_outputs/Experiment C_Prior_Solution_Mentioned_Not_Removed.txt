Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is in a precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The excerpt hints at his quick thinking (knocking over the light) and his determination to fight back. However, he's outnumbered, tied up, and Blofeld seems to be enjoying the power dynamic. 

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is captured, Blofeld is menacing, and the description of the tightening wire adds a physical threat.  We know Bond is capable of escaping, but the immediate danger and Blofeld's cruel intentions keep us on edge.
