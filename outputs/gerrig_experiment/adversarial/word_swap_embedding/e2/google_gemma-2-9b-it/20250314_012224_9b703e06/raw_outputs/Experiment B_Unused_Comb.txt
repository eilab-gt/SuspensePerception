Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to evade the initial attack and disarm one of the gunmen.  However, he's now disarmed and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, who seems to have anticipated his every move.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  We see him struggle against the odds, but ultimately be overpowered. The final line, "Licenses'p not debris moment," leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, eager to know what Le Chiffre has in store for Bond
