Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is currently captured and in a precarious situation, the excerpt hints at his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet.  He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand before being subdued.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and the graphic description of Bond's binding create a sense of anticipation and worry for his fate.
