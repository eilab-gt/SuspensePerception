Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He managed to briefly disrupt the gunmen and even tried to conceal his weapon.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is outnumbered and disarmed, and Le Chiffre's calm demeanor adds to the feeling of danger. The quick action and close calls keep the reader engaged.
