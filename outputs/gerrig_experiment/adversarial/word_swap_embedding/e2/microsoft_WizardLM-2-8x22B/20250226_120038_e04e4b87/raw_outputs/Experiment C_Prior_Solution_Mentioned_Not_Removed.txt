1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
   - 5. Moderately likely

Given James Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity. The passage indicates that Bond has already attempted an escape, using the distraction of the bird collision to his advantage. This shows his quick thinking and ability to capitalize on unexpected events. Additionally, the fact that Blofeld mentions a previous guard who died after Bond's escape suggests that Bond has a track record of evading capture. However, the situation is serious, with Bond now bound by piano wire, and the presence of Crushak, a formidable guard, introduces a significant challenge, which justifies a moderate rather than high likelihood of escape.
