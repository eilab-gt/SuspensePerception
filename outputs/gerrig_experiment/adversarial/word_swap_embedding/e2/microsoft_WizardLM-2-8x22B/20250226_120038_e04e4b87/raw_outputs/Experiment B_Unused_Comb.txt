1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness and previous encounters with danger, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. His ability to defend himself and remain calm under pressure suggests that he has a fair chance of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**

The detailed description of the confrontation, Bond's tactical response, and the uncertainty of his situation all contribute to a high level of suspense.
