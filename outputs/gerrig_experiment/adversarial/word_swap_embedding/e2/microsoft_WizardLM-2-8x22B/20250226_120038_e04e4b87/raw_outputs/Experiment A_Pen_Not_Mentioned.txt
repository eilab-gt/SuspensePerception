1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given James Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Le Chiffre. His decision to attack the gunmen and his agility in the face of danger suggest that he is capable of creating opportunities for escape.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is outnumbered and captured, yet he still takes the initiative to resist and attempt to communicate with Vesper. The physical confrontation and the mention of weapons contribute to the suspense, as does the presence of Le Chiffre, who seems to be one step ahead of Bond. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to escape.
