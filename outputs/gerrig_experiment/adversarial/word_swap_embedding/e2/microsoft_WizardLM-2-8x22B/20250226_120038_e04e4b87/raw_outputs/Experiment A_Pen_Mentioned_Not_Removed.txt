1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is outnumbered and captured, yet he attempts a daring maneuver to follow Vesper and potentially communicate with her. The physical confrontation and the mention of Bond preparing for an exchange with Vesper create a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
