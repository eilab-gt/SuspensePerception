1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The passage describes a scenario where Bond is captured, but his skills and experience suggest that he has a reasonable chance of turning the tables on his captors.
