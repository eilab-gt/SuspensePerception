1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The narrative suggests that Bond is already planning his next move and has managed to conceal a potential weapon (his fountain pen), indicating that he is preparing for an opportunity to fight back or escape.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The detailed description of the violent confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the uncertainty of their predicament create a sense of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and concerned about the characters' fates, wondering how Bond will use his wits and available resources to turn the situation around.
