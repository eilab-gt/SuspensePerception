1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from perilous situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The description of his actions during the capture suggests that he is already planning and looking for opportunities to resist and potentially escape.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies, yet he is actively looking for ways to resist and communicate with Vesper. The physical confrontation and Bond's quick thinking create a sense of urgency and danger, which contributes to the suspense. Readers are likely to be engaged and wondering how Bond will manage to turn the situation to his advantage, which is a hallmark of suspenseful storytelling.
