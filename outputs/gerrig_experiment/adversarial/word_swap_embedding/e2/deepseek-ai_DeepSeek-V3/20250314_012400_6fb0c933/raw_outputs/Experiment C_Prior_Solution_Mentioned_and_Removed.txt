***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tightly bound and under the watch of Crushak, who has orders to shoot him if he attempts to escape. Blofeld also mentions that Bond’s previous guard died after Bond escaped, implying heightened security this time. The situation seems dire, making escape "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is very suspenseful due to the tension created by Bond’s capture, the threat of violence, and the uncertainty of what Blofeld will do next. The detailed description of Bond’s restraints and the menacing presence of Crushak add to the suspense.
