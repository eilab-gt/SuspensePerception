 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is not impossible for him to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond being held captive and in pain from the piano wire. The fact that the outcome of his situation is uncertain adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
