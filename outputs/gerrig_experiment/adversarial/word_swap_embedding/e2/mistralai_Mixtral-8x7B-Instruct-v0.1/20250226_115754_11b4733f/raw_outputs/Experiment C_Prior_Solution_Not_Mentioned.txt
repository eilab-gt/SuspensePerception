 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his men. However, Bond has already shown some resourcefulness in trying to escape, so there is a possibility that he may find a way to escape in the future. Given the limited context, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely" (option 2).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond being held captive and in danger of being harmed. The use of descriptive language and the sense of uncertainty about what will happen next contribute to a feeling of suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
