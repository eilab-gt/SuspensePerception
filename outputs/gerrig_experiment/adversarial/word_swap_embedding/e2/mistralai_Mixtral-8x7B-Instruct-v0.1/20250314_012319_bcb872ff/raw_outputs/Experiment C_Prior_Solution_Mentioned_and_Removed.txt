 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld's captivity with certainty. However, considering Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "very likely" (6) that he will find a way to escape.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being overpowered and captured by Blofeld and his henchmen. The immediate danger and uncertainty of the situation, as well as the ominous introduction of the character "Crushak," contribute to a sense of suspense. Therefore, one might rate the suspensefulness as "moderately suspenseful" (5) or "very suspenseful" (6).
