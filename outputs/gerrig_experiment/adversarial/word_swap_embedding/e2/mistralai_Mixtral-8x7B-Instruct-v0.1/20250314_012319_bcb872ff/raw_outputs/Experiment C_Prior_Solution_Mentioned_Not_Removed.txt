 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his men, and they are taking measures to ensure he can't escape, such as tying him up with wire. However, Bond has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as moderately likely (option 5).

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being held captive and facing the threat of violence. The use of descriptive language and the ominous tone contribute to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as moderately suspenseful (option 5).
