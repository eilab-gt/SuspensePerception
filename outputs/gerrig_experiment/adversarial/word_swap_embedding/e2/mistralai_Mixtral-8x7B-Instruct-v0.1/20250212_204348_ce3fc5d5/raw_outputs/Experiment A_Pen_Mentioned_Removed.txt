 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is currently being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and Le Chiffre is taking precautions to ensure that Bond is disarmed and unable to escape. Therefore, it seems that it may not be very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point in the story. So, I would answer "1. Not very likely".

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, but is ultimately overpowered and captured. This type of situation is often used in thriller and adventure stories to build suspense and tension, and this passage is no exception. The quick and precise movements of the gunmen, the unexpected twist of Bond's ankle, and Le Chiffre's calm and confident demeanor all contribute to a sense of suspense and uncertainty about what will happen next. Therefore, I would answer "6. Very suspenseful".
