 Question 1: Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as "somewhat likely." While Bond is currently in a difficult situation, he has previously shown resourcefulness and skill in getting out of tight spots. However, the fact that he is currently bound to a chair and under the watch of one of Blofeld's men makes it uncertain how and when he will be able to escape.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author does a good job of building tension through the use of descriptive language and the actions of the characters. Bond's narrow escape from Blofeld and the subsequent capture by Blofeld's henchman creates a sense of uncertainty and danger. The fact that Bond is at the mercy of Blofeld and his men and the outcome of the situation is not yet clear adds to the suspense.
