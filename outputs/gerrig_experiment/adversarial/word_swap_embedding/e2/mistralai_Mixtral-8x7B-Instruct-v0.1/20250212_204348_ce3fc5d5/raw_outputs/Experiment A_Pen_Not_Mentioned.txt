 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and they have already disarmed him. Although Bond is a skilled and experienced agent, his immediate chances of escape do not seem high in this situation. Therefore, I would answer "Not very likely" for Question 1.

Question 2: As for Question 2, the passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it is not clear whether he will be successful. The use of descriptive language and the sense of urgency conveyed in the passage contribute to a feeling of suspense. Therefore, I would answer "Very suspenseful" for Question 2.
