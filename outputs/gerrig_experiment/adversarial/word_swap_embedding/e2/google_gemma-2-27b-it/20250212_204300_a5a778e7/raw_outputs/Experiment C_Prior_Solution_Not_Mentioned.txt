Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the distraction to his advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken precautions.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through several elements:

* **Bond's capture:** He is clearly in a dangerous situation.
* **Blofeld's menacing tone:** His words and demeanor suggest a willingness to use violence.
* **The introduction of Crushak:** A physically imposing and potentially brutal enforcer.
* **Bond's restraint:** The detailed description of his binding emphasizes his helplessness.
* **The open ending:** We are left wondering what Blofeld's ultimate plan is and whether Bond will find a way out.
