Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld's introduction of Crushak, described as "devoted to eliminating such irritations," suggests a more formidable obstacle this time.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial escape attempt is thwarted, he's captured and restrained in a painful manner, and Blofeld introduces a new, seemingly ruthless guard. The mention of the previous guard's death adds a layer of danger and uncertainty.
