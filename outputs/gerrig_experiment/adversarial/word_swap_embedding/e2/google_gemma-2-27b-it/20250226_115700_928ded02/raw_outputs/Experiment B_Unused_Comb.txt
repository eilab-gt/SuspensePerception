Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered, disarmed, and in a vulnerable position. The excerpt doesn't give us enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden intrusion, the violence, Bond's initial struggle, and his eventual capture all contribute to a high level of suspense. The ending, with Bond feeling "puny and impotent," leaves the reader wondering what will happen next and heightens the tension.
