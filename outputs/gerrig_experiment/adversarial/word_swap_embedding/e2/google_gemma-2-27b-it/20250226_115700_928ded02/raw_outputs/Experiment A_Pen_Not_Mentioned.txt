Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and agility in the passage, he is outnumbered and outgunned. The fact that Le Chiffre seems to anticipate Bond's moves adds to the difficulty.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a desperate situation, and the action is fast-paced. The descriptions of Le Chiffre's control and Bond's attempts to fight back create a sense of uncertainty and danger.
