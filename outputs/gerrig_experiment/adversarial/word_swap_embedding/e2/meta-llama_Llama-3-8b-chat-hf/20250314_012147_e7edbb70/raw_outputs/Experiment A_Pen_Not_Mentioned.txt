Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, being prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond and Vesper, and that they are being held at gunpoint, makes it unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a life-or-death situation, and that they are being held captive by a ruthless criminal. The use of vivid descriptions and quick-paced action adds to the suspense, making it difficult to put the passage down. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be caught.
