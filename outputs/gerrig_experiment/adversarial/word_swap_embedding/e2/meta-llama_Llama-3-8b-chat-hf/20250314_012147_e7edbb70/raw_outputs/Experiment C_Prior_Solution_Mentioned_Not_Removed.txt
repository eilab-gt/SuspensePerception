Answering Question 1:

I choose option 1: Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen. The description of the scene, including the use of physical restraints and the threat of death, suggests that their chances of escape are slim.

Answering Question 2:

I choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful due to the vivid and intense description of the scene. The use of sensory details, such as the darkness of the room, the sound of the glass shattering, and the feeling of the wires tightening around Bond's arms, creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will meet a tragic end.
