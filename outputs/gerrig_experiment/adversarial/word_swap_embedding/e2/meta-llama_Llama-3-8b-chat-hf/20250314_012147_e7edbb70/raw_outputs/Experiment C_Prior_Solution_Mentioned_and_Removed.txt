Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and Hepburn. Bond is being restrained by wire and is at the mercy of his captors. Given the situation, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, and that his captors are willing to use violence against him. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "eminently vast ja very disgusting fella" and the "wood bras chair", adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or survive the situation.
