Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being searched and disarmed. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from this situation, especially since he is being held at gunpoint and his weapons have been taken away.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

Bond and Vesper are trapped and being held captive by their enemies, and it seems like they are in a desperate situation. The use of vivid language and the fast-paced action also adds to the suspense, making it feel like anything could happen at any moment.
