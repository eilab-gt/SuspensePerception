Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which is causing him pain. Blofeld has also threatened to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to Crushak. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's threats and the presence of the two gunmen create a sense of menace. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next, keeping the reader engaged and curious.
