Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has a large and ugly man, Crushak, who is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, which suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is taunting him, which makes the reader feel anxious and worried about Bond's fate. The description of Crushak's ugly face and his menacing behavior adds to the suspense, making the reader feel like something bad is going to happen to Bond. The dark and dimly lit office also adds to the sense of foreboding, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, waiting for something to happen.
