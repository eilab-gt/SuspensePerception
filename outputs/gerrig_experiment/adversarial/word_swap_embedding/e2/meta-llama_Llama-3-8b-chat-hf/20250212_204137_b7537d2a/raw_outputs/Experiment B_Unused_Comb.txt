Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond has been caught off guard and is now trapped, with no clear means of escape. He has been disarmed and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without a plan or some kind of intervention.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and precarious situation for Bond. The sudden and unexpected attack by Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of urgency and danger, and Bond's attempts to defend himself are foiled. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be subjected to Le Chiffre's wrath. The use of vivid descriptions and Bond's own thoughts and feelings adds to the suspense, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing the danger and uncertainty.
