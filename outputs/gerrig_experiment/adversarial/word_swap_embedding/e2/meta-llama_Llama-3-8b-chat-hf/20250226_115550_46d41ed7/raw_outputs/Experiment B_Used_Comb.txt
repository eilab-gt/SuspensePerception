Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped and disarmed, and Le Chiffre has the upper hand. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his captors, especially since he is outnumbered and outgunned.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dangerous situation for Bond. The sudden and unexpected attack by Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of urgency and danger, and Bond's attempts to defend himself and escape are met with failure. The passage also creates a sense of vulnerability and helplessness, as Bond is disarmed and trapped, which adds to the suspense.
