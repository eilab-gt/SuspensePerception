***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured and is being tied up by Crushak, but given Bond's history of escaping from dangerous situations, it is neither certain that he will escape nor that he will not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes Bond's capture and the immediate threat to his life. The tension is heightened by the description of Bond's desperate attempt to escape and the introduction of a new, formidable adversary in Crushak. The uncertainty of Bond's fate adds to the suspense.
