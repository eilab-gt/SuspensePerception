***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond is in a precarious situation, being tied up and guarded by Crushak, previous experiences suggest that Bond has a history of escaping from difficult situations. However, the current circumstances, including the presence of a guard specifically instructed to shoot if Bond attempts to speak, introduce uncertainty.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is highly suspenseful due to the immediate danger Bond is in, being tied up and at the mercy of his captors. The tension is heightened by the description of Crushak's readiness to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak, and the uncertainty of Bond's ability to escape adds to the suspense.
