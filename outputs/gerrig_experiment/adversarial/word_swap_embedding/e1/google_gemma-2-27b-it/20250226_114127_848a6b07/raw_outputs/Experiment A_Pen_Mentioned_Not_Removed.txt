Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. The fact that Le Chiffre seems to anticipate Bond's moves suggests a difficult escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and facing a cunning opponent. The descriptions of the fight and Le Chiffre's control create a sense of urgency and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
