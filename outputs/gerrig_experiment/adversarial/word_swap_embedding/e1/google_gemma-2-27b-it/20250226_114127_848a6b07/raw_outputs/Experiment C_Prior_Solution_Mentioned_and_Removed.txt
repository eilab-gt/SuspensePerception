Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently bound and under guard, he has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations. The fact that Blofeld feels the need to have Crushak specifically ordered to shoot Bond if he speaks suggests Blofeld is aware of Bond's resourcefulness and is taking extra precautions.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, threatened, and physically restrained. Blofeld's calm demeanor and the introduction of the brutal Crushak create a sense of impending danger. The reader is left wondering how Bond will possibly escape this situation.
