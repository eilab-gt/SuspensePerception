Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is currently bound and in a precarious situation, he's James Bond. He's known for his resourcefulness, cunning, and ability to turn the tables. The fact that he managed to briefly create chaos and disorient Blofeld suggests he's not entirely helpless.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, threatened, and physically restrained. The descriptions of Crushak's menacing presence and Blofeld's cold demeanor heighten the sense of danger. The mention of past guards dying while Bond was captive adds a layer of grim realism.
