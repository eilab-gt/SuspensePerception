Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and outnumbered, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The fact that he managed to land a blow on one of the gunmen suggests he won't give up easily.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor and the description of Bond feeling "tenuous and helpless" heighten the suspense.
