Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently restrained and under guard, he has a history of escaping seemingly impossible situations. His quick thinking with the rug and the bird distraction show he's still resourceful.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a tense atmosphere with Bond being captured, threatened, and restrained. The introduction of the menacing Crushak and Blofeld's explicit orders to shoot add to the suspense.  The reader is left wondering how Bond will possibly get out of this situation.
