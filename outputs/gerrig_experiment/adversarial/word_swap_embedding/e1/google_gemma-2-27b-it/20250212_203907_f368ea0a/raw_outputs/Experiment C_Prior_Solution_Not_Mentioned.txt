Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the distraction to his advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld's statement about leaving him with Crushak to "contemplate his rude behavior" suggests Bond is in a precarious situation. However, this is a James Bond story, and we know he's resourceful and resilient.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, he's captured and restrained in a painful manner, and Blofeld's calm, menacing demeanor adds to the suspense. The introduction of Crushak as a brutal enforcer further heightens the sense of danger.
