1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
   - 5. Moderately likely

Given James Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity. The passage indicates that Bond has already attempted an escape, using the distraction of the bird to his advantage. This shows his quick thinking and resourcefulness. Additionally, the fact that Blofeld mentions a previous guard who failed to keep Bond captive and subsequently died suggests that Bond has a reputation for escaping and that Blofeld's henchmen are not infallible. The use of piano wire to bind Bond also implies a level of discomfort and potential for Bond to work on loosening his restraints over time.

2. **How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
   - 6. Very suspense
