1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
   - 5. Moderately likely

Given James Bond's history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity. The passage indicates that Bond has previously escaped from Blofeld, suggesting that he has the skills and resourcefulness to attempt another escape. However, the current situation seems more challenging with the presence of Blofeld's large and ugly henchman, Crushak, who has been instructed to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak or escape. This adds a layer of difficulty to Bond's predicament, but given Bond's track record, a moderate likelihood of escape seems appropriate.
