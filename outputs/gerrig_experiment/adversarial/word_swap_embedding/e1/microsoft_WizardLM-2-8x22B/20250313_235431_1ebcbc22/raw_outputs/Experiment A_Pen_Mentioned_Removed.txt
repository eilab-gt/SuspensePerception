1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The passage indicates that Bond is already attempting to create opportunities for himself and Vesper, suggesting that he is actively working towards an escape.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The detailed description of Bond's calculated actions to inflict damage and communicate with Vesper, despite being bound and searched, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what Bond's next move will be and whether he will succeed in escaping with Vesper.
