1. **Moderately likely (5)** - Given Bond's resourcefulness, combat skills, and history of escaping from perilous situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)** - The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and physically overpowered by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The description of the struggle, the frisking for weapons, and the mention of a "nan garbage timeline" by Le Chiffre all contribute to a high level of suspense, as the reader is left wondering how Bond will extricate himself from this dangerous scenario.
