1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The passage describes a scenario where Bond is captured, but his skills and experience suggest that he has a reasonable chance of turning the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and violent confrontation where Bond is overpowered and captured. The detailed description of the struggle, the presence of guns, and the physical manhandling of Bond create a tense atmosphere that leaves the reader wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen next. The fact that Bond is described as feeling "puny and impotent" adds to the suspense, as it is an unusual and vulnerable state for the typically confident and capable secret agent.
