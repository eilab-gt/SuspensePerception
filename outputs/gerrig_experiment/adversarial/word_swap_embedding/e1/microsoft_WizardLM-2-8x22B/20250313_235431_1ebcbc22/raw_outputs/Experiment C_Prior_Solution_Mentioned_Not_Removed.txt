1. **How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
   - 5. Moderately likely

Given James Bond's history and his resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches. The text suggests that Bond has already initiated an escape attempt by causing a distraction and has a history of escaping from precarious situations. Additionally, the presence of a large and loathsome man, presumably another henchman, and the mention of piano wire indicate that Bond is in a tight spot, but not necessarily an inescapable one. Bond's previous encounters with Blofeld and his henchmen often result in daring escapes, so it is reasonable to assume that he has a fair chance of doing so again.
