Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which is causing him pain. Blofeld has also threatened to shoot Bond if he tries to speak to Crushak. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's threats and the presence of the two gunmen make it clear that Bond is in grave danger. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his predicament.
