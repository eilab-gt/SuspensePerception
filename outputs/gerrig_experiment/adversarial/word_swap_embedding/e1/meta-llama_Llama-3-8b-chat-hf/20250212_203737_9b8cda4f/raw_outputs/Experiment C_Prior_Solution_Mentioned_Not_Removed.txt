Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is being guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak. Blofeld has also mentioned that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, implying that Bond is in a precarious situation. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and is being threatened by a large and menacing man. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large bird crashing into the wall of glass" and the "ugly man contorting his face into what he might have intended as a smile", adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond next, such as whether he will be able to escape or if he will be harmed by Crushak. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of suspense and tension.
