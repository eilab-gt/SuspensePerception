Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he has already demonstrated his skill and resourcefulness.  He managed to disarm one of the attackers initially, and his agility suggests he might be able to outmaneuver them. However, being outnumbered and captured by Le Chiffre, a cunning adversary, makes a clean escape unlikely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen and Le Chiffre's menacing presence creates a sense of danger. The fact that Bond is captured and at Le Chiffre's mercy leaves the reader wondering how he will escape
