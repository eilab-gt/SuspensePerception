Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is in a precarious situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking.  The passage highlights his agility and ability to improvise (like transferring his pen).  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The scene is tense. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men. The short, fragmented sentences and action-packed descriptions create a sense of urgency and danger.
