Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is in a precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The excerpt hints at his quick thinking (knocking over the light) and his determination to fight back. However, he's outnumbered, tied up, and Blofeld seems to be enjoying the power dynamic. 

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond captured, Blofeld's menacing demeanor, and the threat of violence. The description of the tightening wire adds a physical element of danger.  While it's not heart-stoppingly suspenseful, it definitely keeps the reader engaged
