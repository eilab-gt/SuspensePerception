Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently bound and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman,  the passage hints at Bond's resourcefulness and ability to outsmart his opponents.  He managed to cause a distraction earlier, and his history suggests he won't go down without a fight. 

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a sense of danger and tension. Bond is captured, bound, and threatened with violence. Blofeld's menacing tone and the introduction of the brutal Crushak add to the suspense. However, it lacks the immediate, heart-pounding action that would make it extremely suspenseful.
