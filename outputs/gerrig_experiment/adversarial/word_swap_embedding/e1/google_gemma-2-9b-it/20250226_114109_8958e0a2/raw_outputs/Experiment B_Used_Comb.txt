Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and disarmed, he displays his characteristic resourcefulness and agility.  The passage suggests he's not completely helpless, but Le Chiffre has the upper hand for now.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The sudden intrusion, the threat of violence, and Bond's initial disadvantage create a sense of tension.  However, the passage doesn't reach a cliffhanger or a moment of extreme peril, keeping the suspense at a moderate level.
