Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  he's shown time and again to be resourceful and capable of escaping seemingly impossible situations.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond trying to take advantage of a distraction, only to be thwarted. The introduction of the menacing Crushak and Blofeld's threat add to the sense of danger and uncertainty.  Bond's capture and the painful restraint heighten the suspense, leaving the reader eager to know what happens next.
