 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld's captivity with certainty. However, considering Bond's history as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, one might lean towards options 5, 6, or 7 (moderately likely, very likely, or extremely likely).

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being overpowered and captured by Blofeld and his men. The imminent danger and uncertainty of the outcome make the passage moderately suspenseful, so I would select option 4 for Question 2.
