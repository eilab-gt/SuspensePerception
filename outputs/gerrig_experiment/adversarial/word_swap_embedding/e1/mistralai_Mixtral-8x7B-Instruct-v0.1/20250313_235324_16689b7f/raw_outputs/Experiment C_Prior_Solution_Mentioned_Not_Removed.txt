 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his men, and they are taking measures to ensure he can't escape, such as tying him up with wire. However, Bond has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as moderately likely (5 out of 7).

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond is being held captive and is at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. The use of descriptive language and the sense of danger and uncertainty contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as very suspenseful (6 out of 7).
