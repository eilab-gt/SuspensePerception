 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we do not have enough context about Bond's current situation or his history of escaping similar situations to make an accurate prediction. I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Question 2: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Blofeld and his men. However, we do not have enough information about what will happen next to determine the level of suspense. I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

It's important to note that my answers are based solely on the provided excerpt and do not take into account any prior knowledge of the James Bond series or the book 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.
