 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we do not have specific details about the current situation or Bond's condition, making it difficult to accurately determine his likelihood of escaping. However, considering Bond's skills and experiences in similar situations from the book series, one might lean towards him having a higher chance of escape. So, a suitable answer might be moderately likely (5).

Question 2: The passage describes a tense scene where Bond is in danger and being hunted by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond is trying to escape and protect Vesper, which adds to the suspense. Additionally, the description of Bond's quick thinking and evasive maneuvers also contribute to the tension. Therefore, the passage can be considered moderately suspenseful (5).
