 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his men. However, Bond has already shown some resourcefulness in trying to escape, so there is a possibility that he may find a way to escape in the future. Given the limited context, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely" (option 2).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond is trying to escape from Blofeld's clutches, only to be thwarted by Blofeld's henchman. This level of tension and uncertainty can be quite suspenseful for the reader, as they are left wondering what will happen to Bond next. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "moderately suspenseful" (option 5).
