 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre, as it depends on the events that follow. However, given Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might lean towards "moderately likely" (5) or "very likely" (6), understanding that there are risks and challenges involved.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and is in a challenging situation, the suspense level is quite high. Therefore, I would select "very suspenseful" (6) for this passage.
