 Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Blofeld and his men. Bond did manage to momentarily distract them, but he still ended up being tied to a chair. Given this information, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely" (2). While it's clear that Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent, the text does not provide any details about how he might escape from his current situation.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense situation with Bond being captured and at the mercy of his enemy. The author also describes the increasing pain Bond feels as he is tied to the chair, adding to the suspense. However, the tone of the passage is not overly dramatic, and the author does not use any particularly suspenseful language. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as "somewhat suspenseful" (2).
