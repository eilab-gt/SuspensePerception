***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide any clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond is a skilled agent, he is currently in a precarious situation, trapped and tied up by Blofeld's henchmen. However, Bond's past experiences and abilities suggest that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The description of Crushak tying Bond up with wire, causing him physical pain, adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The threat of being shot if Bond tries to speak or escape also raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
