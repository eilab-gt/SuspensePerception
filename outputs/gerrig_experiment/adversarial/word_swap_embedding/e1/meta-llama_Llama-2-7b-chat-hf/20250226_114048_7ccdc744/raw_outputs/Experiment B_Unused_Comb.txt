  Great, thank you for providing the passage from Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, 'Casino Royale'. Based on the passage, I would answer Question 1 as:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

4. Neutral or Uncertain

While Bond is able to defend himself against Le Chiffre's gunmen and avoid being seriously injured, he is still trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The passage does not provide any clear indication of how Bond will escape or whether he will be able to escape at all.

Now, based on the passage, I would answer Question 2 as:

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful as Bond is trapped
