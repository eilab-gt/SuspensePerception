***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***  
1. Not very likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
6. Very suspenseful  

Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is tightly restrained with piano wire, and Blofeld has explicitly warned that any attempt to escape or communicate will result in Bond being shot. The situation seems dire, making escape seem "not very likely."  
- **Question 2**: The passage is filled with tension—Bond’s failed escape attempt, the threat of violence, and the ominous presence of Crushak create a "very suspenseful" atmosphere.
