Explanation:  
- **Question 1**: Bond is outnumbered, disarmed, and under the control of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. His attempt to escape was quickly thwarted, and he is now being searched and restrained. The situation appears dire, making it "not very likely" that he will escape at this moment.  
- **Question 2**: The passage is highly suspenseful due to the tension of Bond's failed escape attempt, the physical struggle, and the looming threat from Le Chiffre and his men. The uncertainty of Bond's fate and the rapid action contribute to a "very suspenseful" atmosphere.
