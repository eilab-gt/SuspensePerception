Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond is able to evade the gunmen and cause some damage, Le Chiffre seems to be in control of the situation and has Bond and Vesper at his mercy.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Moderately suspenseful". There is a sense of urgency and danger as Bond tries to evade the gunmen and escape from Le Chiffre, but the passage also has a sense of inevitability as it seems clear that Bond and Vesper are in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation.
