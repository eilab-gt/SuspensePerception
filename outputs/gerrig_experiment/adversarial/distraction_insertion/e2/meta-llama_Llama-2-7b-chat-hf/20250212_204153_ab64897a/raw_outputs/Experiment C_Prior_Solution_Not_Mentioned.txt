  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from similar traps in the past, the passage suggests that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for him this time, with Bond being tied up and left in the care of his two gunmen.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond finds himself trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of the situation make for a suspenseful read.
