  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from dangerous situations before, Blofeld seems to have laid a successful trap for him this time, with two gunmen and a cleverly set up trap. It's unclear how Bond will be able to escape from this situation, especially since he is pinned down by the piano wire.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The use of the bird crashing into the wall of glass, followed by Bond's quick thinking to pull up the rug and create a distraction, creates a sense of urgency and tension.
