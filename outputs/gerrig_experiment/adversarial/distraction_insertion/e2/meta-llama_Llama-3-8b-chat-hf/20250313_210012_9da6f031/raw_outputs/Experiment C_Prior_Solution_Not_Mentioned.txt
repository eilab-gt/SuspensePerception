Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has taken away his phone and keys. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld is in control. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
