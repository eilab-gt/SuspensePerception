Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped and disarmed, and Le Chiffre has the upper hand. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his captors, especially since they have him outnumbered and outgunned.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dire situation for Bond. The sudden and unexpected attack by Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of urgency and danger, and Bond's attempts to defend himself are foiled. The use of vivid descriptions and the focus on Bond's vulnerability and helplessness creates a sense of tension and foreboding, making the reader feel like anything could happen next.
