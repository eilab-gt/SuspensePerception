Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunman, Crushak, and is being held in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms. This doesn't seem like a favorable situation for escape.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's ominous threats and actions creating a sense of foreboding. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkness, and the appearance of Crushak all add to the suspenseful atmosphere.
