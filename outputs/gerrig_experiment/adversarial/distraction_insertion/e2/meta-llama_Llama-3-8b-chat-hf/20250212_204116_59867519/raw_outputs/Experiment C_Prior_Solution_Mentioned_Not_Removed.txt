Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak will be responsible for keeping Bond captive. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches in the immediate future.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's ominous words and the presence of the large and ugly Crushak create a sense of foreboding. The use of dark and dim lighting, the sound of the bird crashing into the wall, and the sudden appearance of Crushak all contribute to a sense of surprise and uncertainty, making the passage very suspenseful.
