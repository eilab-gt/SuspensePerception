Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has lost his watch, which could be a crucial tool for his escape. Additionally, he is being searched and disarmed, which makes it even more difficult for him to escape. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is being held captive and is being searched for any potential weapons, which raises the stakes and creates tension. The use of vivid language, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand", adds to the suspense and creates a sense of intensity. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
