Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped and disarmed, and Le Chiffre has the upper hand. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his captors, especially since he is outnumbered and outgunned.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of danger and tension. Bond is caught off guard and is unable to defend himself, and Le Chiffre's men are rough and efficient. The use of action and violence adds to the suspense, and the fact that Bond is trapped and helpless creates a sense of urgency and danger. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond next, which adds to the suspense.
