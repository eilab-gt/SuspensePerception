Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by piano wire. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from this situation.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being restrained, and Blofeld is taunting him with his own cleverness. The use of vivid descriptions and the sudden appearance of the large bird crashing into the wall of glass adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape.
