Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is in a precarious situation, he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past.  The distraction with the bird and his initial attempt to escape suggest he won't go down without a fight. However, Blofeld is clearly prepared for Bond's tricks, and Crushak's presence and Blofeld's threat make a straightforward escape unlikely.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape, the sudden darkness, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling warning all contribute to a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
