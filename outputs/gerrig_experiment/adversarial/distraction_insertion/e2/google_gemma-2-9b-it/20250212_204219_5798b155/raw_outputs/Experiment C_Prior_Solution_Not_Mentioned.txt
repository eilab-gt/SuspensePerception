Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation, he has shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past.  The fact that he managed to briefly distract Blofeld and make a run for it suggests he won't go down without a fight.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and the graphic description of Bond being bound create a sense of danger and uncertainty.  We know Bond is in trouble, but there's still a glimmer of hope that he might find a way out.
