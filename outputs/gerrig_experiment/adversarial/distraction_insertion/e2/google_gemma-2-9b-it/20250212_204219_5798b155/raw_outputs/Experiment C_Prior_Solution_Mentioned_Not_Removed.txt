Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The excerpt hints at his potential for escape, even in this seemingly hopeless situation.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling threat all contribute to a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
