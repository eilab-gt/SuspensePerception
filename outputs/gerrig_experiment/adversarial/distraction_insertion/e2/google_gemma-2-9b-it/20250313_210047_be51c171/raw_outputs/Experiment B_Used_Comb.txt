Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and seems trapped, his resourcefulness and fighting skills are established.  Fleming often sets up seemingly hopeless situations for Bond, only for him to find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack, and the description of his capture and Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor create a sense of unease.  We know Bond is resourceful, but the situation is clearly dangerous.
