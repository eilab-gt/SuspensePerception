Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled. He managed to briefly fight back and escape the initial capture attempt.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is captured, but his attempt to fight back and the description of the gunmen searching him keep the reader on edge, wondering what will happen next.
