Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

While Bond is captured and disarmed, the excerpt shows his quick thinking and fighting skills. He manages to briefly disrupt the gunmen and potentially conceal a weapon.  Fleming's writing often emphasizes Bond's resourcefulness, suggesting he won't go down without a fight.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The descriptions of the gunmen's actions, Bond's desperate attempt to escape, and Le Chiffre's watchful eye all contribute to a sense of impending danger and uncertainty.
