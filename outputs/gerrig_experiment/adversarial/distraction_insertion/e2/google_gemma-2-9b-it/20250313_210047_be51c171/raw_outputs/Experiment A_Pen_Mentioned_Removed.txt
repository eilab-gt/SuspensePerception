Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is currently captured and disarmed, the excerpt shows his quick thinking, agility, and resourcefulness. He managed to briefly fight back and conceal a weapon.  Fleming's writing often emphasizes Bond's ability to improvise and overcome seemingly impossible situations.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**
