Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to evade capture initially and even landed a blow on one of the gunmen.  However, he's disarmed and outnumbered, and Le Chiffre seems to be one step ahead.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's smug demeanor create a sense of impending danger. The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.." adds to the feeling of desperation and helplessness.
