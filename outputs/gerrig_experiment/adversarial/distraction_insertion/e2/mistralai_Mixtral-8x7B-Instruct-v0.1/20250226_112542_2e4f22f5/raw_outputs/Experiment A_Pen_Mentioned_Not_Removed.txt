 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is in a difficult and dangerous situation, being held prisoner by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has already shown his resourcefulness and determination by attempting to escape and cause damage to the gunmen. Given Bond's skills and past experiences, it is possible that he may find a way to escape. Therefore, I would answer "moderately likely" for this question.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and there is a threat to his life, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful". The author has done a good job of building tension and creating a sense of danger and uncertainty.
