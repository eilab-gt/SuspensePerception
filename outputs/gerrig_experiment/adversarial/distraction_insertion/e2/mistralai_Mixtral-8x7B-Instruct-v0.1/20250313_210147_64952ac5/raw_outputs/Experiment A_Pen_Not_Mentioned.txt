 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his men, and they have disarmed him. However, Bond has shown his agility and quick thinking in the past. Considering all these factors, I would answer "Somewhat likely" for the question "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

Question 2: The passage describes a tense scene where Bond is trying to escape from Le Chiffre and his men, and it is clear that Bond is in a dangerous situation. The author also uses descriptive language to create a sense of urgency, such as "Like lightning" and "With a backward kick". Therefore, I would answer "Very suspenseful" for the question "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
