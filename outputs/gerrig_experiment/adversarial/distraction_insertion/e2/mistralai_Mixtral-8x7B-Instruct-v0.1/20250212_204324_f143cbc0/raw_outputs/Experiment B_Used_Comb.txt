 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "somewhat likely." While Bond is certainly a skilled and resourceful agent, he is currently outnumbered and unarmed, making his situation precarious. However, Bond has proven himself to be a resilient character, so there is still a possibility that he could find a way to escape.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The sudden turn of events, in which Bond goes from feeling confident and in control to being surrounded by armed men and stripped of his weapons, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is currently at a disadvantage and unsure of what will happen next adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. Overall, the passage does an excellent job of building tension and keeping the reader engaged in the story.
