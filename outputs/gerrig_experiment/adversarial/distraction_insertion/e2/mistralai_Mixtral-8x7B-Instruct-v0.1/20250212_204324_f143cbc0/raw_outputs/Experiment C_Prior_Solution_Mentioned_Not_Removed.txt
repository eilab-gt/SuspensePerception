 Answer Question 1: "Somewhat likely" - Although Bond was able to create a distraction and make an attempt to escape, he was quickly overpowered by Blofeld's large and ugly companion, Crushak. Bond is now tied up and under the watch of Crushak, making it seem less likely that he will escape easily.

Answer Question 2: "Very suspenseful" - The passage is filled with tension as Bond tries to escape and is met with obstacles. The fact that Bond was able to momentarily distract Blofeld and make an escape attempt, only to be caught and tied up, adds to the suspense. Additionally, the description of Bond's increasing pain as he is tied up with piano wire further builds the tension.
