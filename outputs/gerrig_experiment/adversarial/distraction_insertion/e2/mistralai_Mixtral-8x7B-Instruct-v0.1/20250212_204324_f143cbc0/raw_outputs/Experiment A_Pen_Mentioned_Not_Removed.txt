 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "somewhat likely." While Bond has shown resourcefulness and physical prowess, he is currently outnumbered and disarmed. However, there may be opportunities for him to turn the situation around.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The author has effectively used details to convey a sense of urgency and danger, such as Bond's quick thinking and physical struggles against the gunmen. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
