 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, Bond is currently captured and unable to escape from Blofeld and his gunmen. Although Bond has managed to momentarily distract them, he is quickly overpowered and tied up. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as: 3. Slightly likely.

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene in which Bond is captured and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. The stakes are high, and Bond's life is in danger. The scene is further heightened by the use of descriptive language and vivid imagery, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the "piano wire biting painfully into Bond's flesh." Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as: 6. Very suspenseful.
