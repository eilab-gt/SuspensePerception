 Answer Question 1: "Somewhat likely"
Explanation: Although Bond did manage to momentarily distract Blofeld and cause a commotion, he ultimately still ended up being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. However, Bond has proven to be a resourceful and skilled agent in the past, so there is still a possibility that he could escape from this situation.

Answer Question 2: "Very suspenseful"
Explanation: The passage is filled with tension and suspense as Bond tries to find a way to escape from Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of descriptive language, such as "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bondâ€™s flesh," adds to the suspense and makes the reader wonder if and how Bond will be able to escape.
