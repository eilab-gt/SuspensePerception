 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "somewhat likely." While Bond is a skilled and experienced agent, he is currently disarmed, trapped, and outnumbered. However, Bond has proven to be resourceful and resilient in the past, so there is a chance he may find a way to escape.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The sudden shift from Bond's confident and suave demeanor to his vulnerable and trapped state creates a sense of tension and unease. The fact that Bond is disarmed and outnumbered adds to the suspense, as the outcome of the situation is uncertain. Overall, the passage effectively builds tension and keeps the reader engaged.
