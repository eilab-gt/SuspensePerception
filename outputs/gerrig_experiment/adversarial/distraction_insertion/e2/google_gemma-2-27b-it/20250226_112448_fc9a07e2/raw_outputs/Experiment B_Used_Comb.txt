Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The fact that he's still alive and relatively unharmed suggests the story isn't over yet.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, Bond's initial struggle, and his ultimate capture create a strong sense of tension. The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it" adds to the feeling of unease and foreshadows potential danger.
