Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages a momentary distraction and gets the upper hand briefly, he is quickly subdued by Crushak.  Blofeld seems to be in control and is clearly not finished with Bond. This suggests escape will be difficult, but not impossible given Bond's history.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's initial escape attempt is exciting, but his capture and the introduction of the menacing Crushak create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The repetition of the phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it." adds a layer of mystery and unease.
