Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly thwarted by Crushak.  Blofeld seems to be in control, but Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping tight spots suggest he still has a chance.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through the cat-and-mouse game between Bond and Blofeld. Bond's initial attempt at escape, followed by his capture and the introduction of the menacing Crushak, keeps the reader engaged and wondering what will happen next.
