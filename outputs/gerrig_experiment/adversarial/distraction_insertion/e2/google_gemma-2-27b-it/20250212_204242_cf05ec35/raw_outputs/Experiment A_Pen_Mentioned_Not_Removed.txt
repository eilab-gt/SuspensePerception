Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. The Corsican's skill in disarming him suggests these are dangerous opponents.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a desperate situation, outnumbered and facing a cunning enemy. The quick action, close calls, and Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor all contribute to a high level of suspense.
