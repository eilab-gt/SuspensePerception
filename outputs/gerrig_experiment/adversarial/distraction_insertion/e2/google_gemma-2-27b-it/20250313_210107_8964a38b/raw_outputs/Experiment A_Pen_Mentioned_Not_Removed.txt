Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting spirit, he's clearly outmatched and outnumbered. The Corsican gunman seems particularly skilled.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and facing a dangerous adversary. The descriptions of the Corsican's actions and Le Chiffre's cold demeanor add to the suspense. The mention of Bond's hidden pen suggests a possible plan, but the odds are stacked against him.
