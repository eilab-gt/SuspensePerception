Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The excerpt emphasizes his agility and ability to recover from a fall. This suggests he might find a way to outsmart his captors.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a strong sense of danger and uncertainty. Bond is caught off guard, overpowered, and disarmed. Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and the detail about Bond feeling "puny and impotent" heighten the tension. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
