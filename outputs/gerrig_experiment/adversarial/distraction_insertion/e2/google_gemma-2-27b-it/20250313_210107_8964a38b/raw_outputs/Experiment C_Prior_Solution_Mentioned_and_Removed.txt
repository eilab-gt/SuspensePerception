Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages to momentarily gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's explicit instructions and Crushak's menacing presence suggest a difficult escape. However, Bond's history of resourceful escapes and the mention of the "wind carrying the sound of bells" (a potential clue or foreshadowing) leave a sliver of hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, the detailed description of Bond's restraint, and Blofeld's cold threat create a palpable sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering if Bond can outsmart his captors again.
