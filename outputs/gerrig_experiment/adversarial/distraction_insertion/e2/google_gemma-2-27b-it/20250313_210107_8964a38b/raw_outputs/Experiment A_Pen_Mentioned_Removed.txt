Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and anticipates Bond's moves.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and facing a dangerous adversary. The descriptions of the physical struggle and Le Chiffre's control add to the suspense.  We're left wondering if Bond can outsmart his captors.
