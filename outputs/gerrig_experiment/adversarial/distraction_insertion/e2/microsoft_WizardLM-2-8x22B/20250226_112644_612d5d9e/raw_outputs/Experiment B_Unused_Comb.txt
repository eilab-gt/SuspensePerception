1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and violent confrontation, Bond's quick thinking and physical prowess, and the fact that he is ultimately outnumbered and captured. The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it." adds to the tension, suggesting that Bond is aware of the gravity of the situation and is concerned about the time element, which could be critical in his escape or rescue.
