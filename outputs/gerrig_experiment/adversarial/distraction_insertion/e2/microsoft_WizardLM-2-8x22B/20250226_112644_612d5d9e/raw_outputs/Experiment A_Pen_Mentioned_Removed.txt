1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is outnumbered and captured, yet he attempts a daring move to follow Vesper and potentially communicate with her. The physical confrontation and the fact that Bond is being searched for weapons add to the suspense, as the stakes are high and the outcome uncertain.
