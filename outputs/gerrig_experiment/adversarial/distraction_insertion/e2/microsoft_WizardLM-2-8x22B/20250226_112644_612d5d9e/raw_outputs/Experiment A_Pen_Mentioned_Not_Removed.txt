1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he is already planning and attempting to resist suggests that he has a chance to turn the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is a prisoner and has just been attacked by one of Le Chiffre's henchmen. The mention of Bond planning to do damage and the subsequent search for weapons add to the suspense, as the reader is aware of the stakes and the potential for Bond to either succeed in his escape or face dire consequences. The repeated phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.." also adds a sense of urgency and mystery, contributing to the suspenseful atmosphere.
