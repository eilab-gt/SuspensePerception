1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given James Bond's reputation for escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld. Despite being captured and bound, Bond's resourcefulness and experience in such scenarios suggest that he has a reasonable chance of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**

It describes a tense confrontation between Bond and Blofeld, a distraction involving a large bird, Bond's quick thinking to create an opportunity for escape, and the introduction of a formidable new adversary, Mr. Crushak. The detailed description of Bond being tied up with piano wire adds to the suspense by highlighting the physical restraints and potential for pain, while Blofeld's ominous warning about Crushak's orders to shoot Bond for any attempt to communicate increases
