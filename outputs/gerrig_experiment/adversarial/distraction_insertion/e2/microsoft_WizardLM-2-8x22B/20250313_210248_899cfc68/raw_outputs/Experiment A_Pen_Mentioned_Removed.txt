1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a history of carrying concealed gadgets suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and has already attempted an escape, which was thwarted by the Corsican's quick reflexes. The mention of Bond's fountain pen, which could be a gadget, along with Le Chiffre's close attention to Bond's possessions, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what Bond's next move will be and whether he will be able to overcome the odds stacked against him.
