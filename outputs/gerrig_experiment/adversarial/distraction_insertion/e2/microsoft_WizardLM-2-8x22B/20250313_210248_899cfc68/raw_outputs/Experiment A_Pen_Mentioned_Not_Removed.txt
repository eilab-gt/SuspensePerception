1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Le Chiffre. Despite being captured and outnumbered, Bond's history of getting out of tight situations suggests that he may have hidden resources or a plan to turn the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is a prisoner and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The physical confrontation, Bond's quick thinking, and the mention of a plan to communicate with Vesper all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will manage to escape and what his next move will be.
