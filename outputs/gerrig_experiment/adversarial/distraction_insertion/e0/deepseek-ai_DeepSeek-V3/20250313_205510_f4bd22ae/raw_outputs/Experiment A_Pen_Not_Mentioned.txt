***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***  
**Answer:** 5. Moderately likely  

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***  
**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful  

**Explanation:**  
1. Bond’s resourcefulness and agility are evident in the passage, as he attempts to fight back and escape. However, he is outnumbered and outmaneuvered by Le Chiffre’s men, making his immediate escape uncertain but not impossible. This suggests a moderate likelihood of eventual escape.  
2. The passage is very suspenseful due to the high-stakes situation, Bond’s desperate attempts to fight back, and the tension created by Le Chiffre’s calm yet menacing demeanor. The uncertainty of Bond’s fate and the rapid action contribute to the suspense.
