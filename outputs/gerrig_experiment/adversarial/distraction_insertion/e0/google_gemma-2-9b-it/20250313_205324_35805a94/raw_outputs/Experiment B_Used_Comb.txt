Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and seems trapped, his resourcefulness and fighting skills are established.  Fleming often sets up seemingly hopeless situations for Bond, only for him to find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen searching him and Le Chiffre's menacing actions create a sense of danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
