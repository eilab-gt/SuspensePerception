Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  the excerpt highlights his resourcefulness and quick thinking. He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand.  Given Bond's history, it's not impossible he'll find a way out, but the odds are stacked against him.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape, the sudden darkness, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling threats all contribute to a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
