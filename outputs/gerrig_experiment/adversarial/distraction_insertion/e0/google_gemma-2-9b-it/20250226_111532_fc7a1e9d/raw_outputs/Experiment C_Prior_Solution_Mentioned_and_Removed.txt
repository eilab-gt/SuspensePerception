Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is in a precarious situation, he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The distraction with the bird and his quick thinking suggest he might find a way out, but Blofeld seems more prepared this time.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's chilling threat all contribute to a sense of impending danger. The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.." adds a layer of unease and mystery.
