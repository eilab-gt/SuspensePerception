Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is currently in a precarious situation,  he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The fact that he managed to briefly distract Blofeld and attempt to escape suggests he won't go down without a fight. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates a sense of tension with Bond's capture, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's threat.  The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.." adds a layer of mystery and  heightens the anticipation of what might happen next.
