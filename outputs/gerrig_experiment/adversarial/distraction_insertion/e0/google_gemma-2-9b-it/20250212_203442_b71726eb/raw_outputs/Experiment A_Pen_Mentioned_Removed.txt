Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Explanation:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He managed to briefly disrupt the gunmen and attempt to reach Vesper.  However, Le Chiffre is clearly in control, has disarmed Bond, and seems to be anticipating his moves. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Explanation:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and disarmed.  The descriptions of the gunmen's actions and Le Chiffre's watchful eye heighten the feeling of danger.  We don't know what Le Chiffre's plans are, which adds to the suspense.
