Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

**Explanation:** While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. He managed to briefly disrupt the gunmen and attempt to reach Vesper.  However, he's now disarmed and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Explanation:** The passage creates a sense of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and disarmed.  The description of the gunmen's actions and Le Chiffre's watchful presence heightens the feeling of danger.  We're left wondering what Le Chiffre's intentions are and how Bond will manage to escape this predicament.
