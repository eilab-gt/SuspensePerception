***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been captured and is being guarded by Crushak, who is under orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak. However, Bond has a history of escaping from dangerous situations, which leaves the outcome uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes involved. Bond is in a precarious situation, captured by Blofeld and guarded by Crushak, who is under orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak. The tension is heightened by the description of Crushak's ugliness and the painful method used to restrain Bond. The uncertainty of Bond's fate adds to the suspense.
