 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is in a difficult and dangerous situation, being held prisoner by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has already shown his resourcefulness and determination by attempting to escape and cause damage to the gunmen. Given Bond's history and skills, it is possible that he may find a way to escape. Therefore, I would answer "moderately likely" for this question.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and has already attempted to escape, I find this passage to be "very suspenseful". There is a sense of danger and uncertainty as to what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and how they will escape from this situation. The stakes are high, and the tension is palpable, making for a suspenseful reading experience.
