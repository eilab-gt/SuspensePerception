 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "somewhat likely." While Bond is a skilled and experienced agent, he is currently disarmed and outnumbered. However, he has proven to be resourceful and resilient in the past, so there is a good chance he will find a way to escape.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The sudden and violent intrusion of Le Chiffre and his men creates a sense of danger and urgency, and the fact that Bond is disarmed and trapped adds to the tension. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, which makes for a suspenseful and engaging reading experience.
