 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond has been overpowered and captured by Le Chiffre and his men, so it doesn't seem very likely that he will escape on his own at this point. However, given that this is a work of fiction and Bond is the protagonist, there's always a chance he could escape or be rescued. So, I would answer "somewhat likely" for now, with the understanding that more information could change this assessment.

Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. While we know that Bond has been in dangerous situations before and often escapes, the fact that he has been captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre creates a sense of uncertainty and tension. The detailed description of Bond being searched and disarmed also adds to the suspense, as we wonder what will happen to him next.
