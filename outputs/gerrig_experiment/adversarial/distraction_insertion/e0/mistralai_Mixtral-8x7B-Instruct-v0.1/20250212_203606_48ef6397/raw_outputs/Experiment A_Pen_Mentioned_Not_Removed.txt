 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "somewhat likely." While Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the passage, he has also been disarmed and is facing at least two armed gunmen.

Question 2: In terms of suspense, I would rate the passage as "very suspenseful." The stakes are high, with Bond and Vesper's lives on the line, and the tension is palpable as Bond tries to evade Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The use of descriptive language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistle of pain," also adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
