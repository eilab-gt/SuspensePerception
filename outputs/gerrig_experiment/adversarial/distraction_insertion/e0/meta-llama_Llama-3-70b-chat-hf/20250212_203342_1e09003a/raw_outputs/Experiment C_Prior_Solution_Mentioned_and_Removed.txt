***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, with him being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. However, Bond has a history of escaping from tight spots, and the passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of his escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and tension. The threat of Bond being shot if he even attempts to speak to Crushak raises the stakes and increases the suspense.
