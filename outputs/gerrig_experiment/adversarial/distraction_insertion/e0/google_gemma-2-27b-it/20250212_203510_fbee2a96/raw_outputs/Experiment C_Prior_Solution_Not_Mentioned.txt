Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness by using the bird distraction and attempting to escape, he is quickly thwarted by Crushak.  Blofeld seems to be in control, but Bond's history suggests he's not easily defeated.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage creates suspense through Bond's initial escape attempt, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the threat of violence. The description of Crushak and the painful binding add to the tension. However, we know Bond is a skilled agent, so there's an underlying expectation that he might find a way out. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore any other aspects of the passage!
