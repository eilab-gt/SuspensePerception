Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped and disarmed, and Le Chiffre has the upper hand. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from his captors, especially since they are well-armed and have the advantage of surprise.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of danger and tension from the very beginning. The sudden burst of the door and the appearance of the gunmen creates a sense of shock and surprise, and Bond's attempts to defend himself are met with failure. The fact that Bond is trapped and disarmed adds to the sense of suspense, and Le Chiffre's calm and collected demeanor only adds to the tension. The passage creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen next, making it extremely suspenseful.
