Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained by piano wire. The situation seems quite dire for Bond, making it unlikely that he will escape.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and helpless against Blofeld and Crushak. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkness, and the appearance of Crushak all contribute to a sense of suspense and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or survive the situation.
