Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and disarmed. Bond's attempts to fight back have been thwarted, and he is now being searched and stripped of his weapons.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped and being searched, and it seems like he is at the mercy of his captors. The use of vivid language, such as "Like lightning" and "very quickly, but somehow delicately", adds to the sense of tension and excitement. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
