Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently trapped in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms, and he is being guarded by a large and ugly man named Crushak. Blofeld has also mentioned that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, implying that Bond is in grave danger. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and he is being guarded by a formidable opponent. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and ugly" man Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is at the mercy of his captors creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate and whether he will be able to escape, which adds to the suspense.
