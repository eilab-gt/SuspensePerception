Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is trapped and disarmed, with no clear way to escape. He is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it's unlikely that he will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dire situation for Bond. The sudden and unexpected attack, Bond's failed attempt to defend himself, and his subsequent disarming and trapping all contribute to a sense of high stakes and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
