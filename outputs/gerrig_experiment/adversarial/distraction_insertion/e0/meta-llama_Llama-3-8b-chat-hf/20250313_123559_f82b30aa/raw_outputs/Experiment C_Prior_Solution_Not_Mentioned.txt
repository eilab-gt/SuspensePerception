Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is facing a large and ugly man, Crushak, who is loyal to Blofeld. Additionally, Blofeld has taken away Bond's phone, which means Bond has no way to call for help. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.
