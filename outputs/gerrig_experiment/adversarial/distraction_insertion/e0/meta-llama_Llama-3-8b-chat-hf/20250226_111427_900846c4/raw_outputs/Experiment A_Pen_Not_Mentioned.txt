Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, being overpowered by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being held captive, which makes it unlikely that he will escape easily.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and that his chances of escape are slim. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" and "He twisted it sharply", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or not.
