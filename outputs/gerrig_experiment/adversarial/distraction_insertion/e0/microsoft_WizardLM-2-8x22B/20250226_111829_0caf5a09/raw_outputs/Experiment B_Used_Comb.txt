1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being trapped and unarmed, Bond's skills and experience suggest that he has a reasonable chance of turning the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a sudden and violent confrontation, with Bond being outnumbered and captured. The detailed description of the action, Bond's quick thinking, and the mention of a hidden watch that Bond keeps looking for but can't find, all contribute to a tense atmosphere that keeps the reader engaged and wondering how Bond will manage to escape his captors.
