1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's history of escaping from perilous situations, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Blofeld. Despite being captured and bound, Bond's resourcefulness and experience in such scenarios suggest that he may find a way to overcome the odds.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes Bond's capture and the introduction of a new threat in the form of Crushak. The tension is heightened by Bond's attempts to create a diversion and his subsequent binding with piano wire, suggesting a level of danger and discomfort. The repeated phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it." adds to the suspense by hinting at Bond's concern for the time or a potential tool for escape that he is unable to locate, which could imply a ticking clock element to the story.
