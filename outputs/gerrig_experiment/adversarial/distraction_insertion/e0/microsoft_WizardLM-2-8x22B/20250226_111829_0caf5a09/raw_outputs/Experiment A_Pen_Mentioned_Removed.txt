1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is outnumbered and captured, yet he attempts a daring move to follow Vesper and potentially communicate with her. The physical confrontation and the fact that Le Chiffre anticipates Bond's actions add to the suspense, making the reader curious about Bond's next move and how he will handle the situation.
