1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation as a resourceful and skilled secret agent, it is reasonable to assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from Le Chiffre. The narrative suggests that Bond is not completely without options, as he has already attempted to resist and has a history of getting out of tight spots.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies, yet he remains defiant and resourceful. The physical confrontation, the mention of hidden watches, and the dialogue all contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere, as the reader is left to wonder how Bond will extricate himself from this perilous situation.
