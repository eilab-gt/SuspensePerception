1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. Despite being outnumbered and unarmed, Bond's training and quick thinking could potentially allow him to turn the tables on his captors.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage is very suspenseful as it describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events where Bond, after a moment of triumph, finds himself captured and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen. The detailed description of the confrontation, Bond's quick but ultimately insufficient response, and the thorough search by the gunmen all contribute to a tense atmosphere that suggests imminent danger and the potential for Bond to employ his wits and skills to overcome the odds.
