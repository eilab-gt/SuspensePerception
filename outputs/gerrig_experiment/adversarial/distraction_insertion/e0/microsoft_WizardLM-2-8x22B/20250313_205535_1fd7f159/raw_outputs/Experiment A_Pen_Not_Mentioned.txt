1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has some knowledge of his surroundings could aid in his escape plan.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and has already made an attempt to escape, which was thwarted. The presence of armed gunmen, the physical confrontation, and the unknown intentions of Le Chiffre contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will succeed in escaping.
