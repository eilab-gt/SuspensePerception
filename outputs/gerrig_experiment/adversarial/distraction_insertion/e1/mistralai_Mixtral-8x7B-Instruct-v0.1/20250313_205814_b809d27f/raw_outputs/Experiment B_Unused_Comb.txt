 Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it seems that Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. There is no indication that Bond has any means of escaping or overpowering his captors, so it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape on his own. However, this is a work of fiction, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations, so it's possible that he could still find a way to escape. Therefore, I would answer Question 1 with option 1: "Not very likely."

As for Question 2, the excerpt describes a tense and suspenseful situation in which Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of descriptive language and the focus on Bond's feelings of vulnerability and powerlessness contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would answer Question 2 with option 5
