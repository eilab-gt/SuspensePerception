 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it seems that Bond is currently captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Although Bond does manage to kick one of them and avoid some of their attacks, he is eventually overpowered and disarmed. Given this information, it seems that it might be challenging for Bond to escape from Le Chiffre's clutches, so I would rate the likelihood as somewhat low, let's say a 2 out of 7.

Answer Question 2: In terms of suspense, the excerpt does a good job of building tension as Bond is pursued by Le Chiffre's gunmen and ultimately captured. The use of descriptive language, such as "spidery summons" and "whistle of pain," adds to the sense of danger and urgency. Additionally, the fact that Bond is unable to find his watch, which presumably contains some sort of weapon or tool, suggests that he may be in a precarious situation. Overall, I would rate the suspense level as moderately high, let's say a 5 out of 7.
