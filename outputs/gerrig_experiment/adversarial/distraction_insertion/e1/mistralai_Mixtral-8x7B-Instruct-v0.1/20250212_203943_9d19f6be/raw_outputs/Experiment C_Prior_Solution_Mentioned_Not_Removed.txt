 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, I would select option "2. Somewhat likely" for the question "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?". Although Bond has been captured and is in a difficult situation, he has already shown some resourcefulness in trying to escape, and there are still unknown factors that could come into play.

Answer Question 2: For the question "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?", I would select option "6. Very suspenseful". The passage effectively builds tension through the use of descriptive language and the portrayal of Bond's predicament. The presence of a dangerous and seemingly invulnerable villain, as well as the introduction of a new and formidable henchman, adds to the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond has managed to escape from Blofeld's clutches in the past raises the stakes and makes the reader wonder if he will be able to do so again.
