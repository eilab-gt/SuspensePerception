 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is in a difficult and dangerous situation, being held prisoner by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, Bond has already shown his resourcefulness and determination by attempting to escape and cause damage to the gunmen. Given Bond's skills and past experiences, it is possible that he may find a way to escape. Therefore, I would answer "moderately likely" for this question.

Question 2: Considering the fact that Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and has already attempted to escape, the passage is quite suspenseful. The author has also described the actions of the gunmen and Le Chiffre in detail, which adds to the tension. Therefore, I would answer "very suspenseful" for this question.
