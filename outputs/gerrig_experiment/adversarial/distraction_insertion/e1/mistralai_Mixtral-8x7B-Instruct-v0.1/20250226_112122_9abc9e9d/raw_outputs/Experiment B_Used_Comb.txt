 Question 1: Based on the information provided, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "somewhat likely." While Bond is a skilled and experienced agent, he is currently disarmed and outnumbered. However, he has proven to be resourceful and resilient in the past, so there is a chance he may find a way to escape.

Question 2: I find this passage to be "very suspenseful." The sudden turn of events, with Bond being ambushed and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men, creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is trapped and unarmed adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape from this dangerous situation.
