 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is in a difficult and dangerous situation, being outnumbered and unarmed. However, Bond has proven to be resourceful and skilled in the past. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as moderately likely (option 5).

Question 2: Considering the tense and uncertain circumstances, with Bond being held captive and his escape attempt thwarted, I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful (option 5).
