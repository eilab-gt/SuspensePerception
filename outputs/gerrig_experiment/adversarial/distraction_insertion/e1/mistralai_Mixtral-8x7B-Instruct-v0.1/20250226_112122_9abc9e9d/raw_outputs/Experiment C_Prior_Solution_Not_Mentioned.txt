 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has been captured by Blofeld and is currently being held prisoner. Although Bond does try to escape and manages to momentarily disarm Blofeld, he is quickly overpowered by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. Bond is then tied up and left in the care of Crushak. Given the current situation, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches anytime soon. So, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as: 2. Somewhat likely.

Answer Question 2: The passage does contain some suspenseful elements, such as Bond's attempt to escape and the presence of armed guards. However, the fact that Bond is quickly overpowered and tied up reduces some of the suspense. Overall, I would rate the suspense level of the passage as: 4. Neutral or Uncertain
