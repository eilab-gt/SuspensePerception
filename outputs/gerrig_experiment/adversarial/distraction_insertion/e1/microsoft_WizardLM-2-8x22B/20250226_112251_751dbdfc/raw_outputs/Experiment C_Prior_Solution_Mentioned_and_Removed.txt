1. **Moderately likely**: Given James Bond's reputation for escaping from precarious situations and his resourcefulness, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes Bond's capture, his attempt to create a diversion, and the introduction of a new threat in the form of Crushak. The repeated mention of Bond's hidden watch adds an element of mystery and suggests that Bond may still have an ace up his sleeve, which contributes to the suspense.
