1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he is already planning and attempting to resist suggests that he has a chance to turn the situation to his advantage.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes Bond's capture, his quick thinking, and the immediate physical confrontation with Le Chiffre's henchmen. The mention of Bond's hidden watch, which he cannot find, adds an element of mystery and urgency. The detailed description of the struggle and Bond's attempt to conceal his intentions with the fountain pen heighten the tension, making the situation feel very suspenseful.
