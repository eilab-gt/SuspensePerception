1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and at the mercy of his enemies. The physical confrontation, the mention of Bond's plan to cause damage, and the search for hidden weapons all contribute to a high level of suspense. The repeated phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it." suggests a sense of urgency and the possibility of a hidden tool or plan that could change the situation, further adding to the suspense.
