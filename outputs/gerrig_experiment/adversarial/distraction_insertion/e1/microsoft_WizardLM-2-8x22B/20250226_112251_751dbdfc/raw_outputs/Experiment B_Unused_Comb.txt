1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes a sudden and violent confrontation, Bond's quick thinking and physical prowess in response to the attack, and the precarious situation he finds himself in, trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.." adds to the tension, suggesting Bond's concern for a potential tool or lifeline that is out of reach.
