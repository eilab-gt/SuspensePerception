1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has some knowledge of his surroundings could aid in his eventual escape.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and has already made an attempt to escape, which was thwarted. The presence of armed gunmen, the silent summons from Le Chiffre, and the physical confrontation all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be engaged and wondering how Bond will manage to extricate himself from this dangerous predicament.
