1. **Moderately likely**: Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre. The fact that he has already attempted an escape and has a history of carrying concealed gadgets suggests that he may still have some tricks up his sleeve.

2. **Very suspenseful**: The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and has already made an attempt to escape, which was thwarted. The presence of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the physical confrontation, and the mention of Bond's concealed pen (which could imply some sort of gadgetry) all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is likely to be curious about how Bond will handle the situation and whether he will be able to overcome the odds and escape.
