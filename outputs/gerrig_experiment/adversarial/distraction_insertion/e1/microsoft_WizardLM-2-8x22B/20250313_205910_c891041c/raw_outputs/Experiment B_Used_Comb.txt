1. **Moderately likely (5)**
   Given Bond's resourcefulness and history of escaping from precarious situations in the series, it is moderately likely that he will find a way to escape from Le Chiffre, despite the current predicament.

2. **Very suspenseful (6)**
   The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured and outnumbered, which naturally creates a sense of suspense regarding his fate.
