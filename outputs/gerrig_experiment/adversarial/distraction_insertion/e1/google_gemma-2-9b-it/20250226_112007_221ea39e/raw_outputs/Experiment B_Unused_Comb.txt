Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and disarmed, the passage highlights his resourcefulness and fighting skills. He manages to evade the gunmen's initial attack and shows a willingness to fight back.  However, he is outnumbered and trapped, suggesting the escape won't be easy.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's confidence turn to vulnerability as he's ambushed. The description of the gunmen, Le Chiffre's menacing presence, and Bond's helplessness create a sense of anticipation and uncertainty about his fate.
