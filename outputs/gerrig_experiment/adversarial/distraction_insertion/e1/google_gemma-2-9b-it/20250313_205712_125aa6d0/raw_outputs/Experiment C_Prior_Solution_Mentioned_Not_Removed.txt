Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  the passage hints at his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet.  He managed to briefly distract Blofeld and create an opportunity for escape, even if it was short-lived.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond in a vulnerable position, trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his menacing henchman. The description of Crushak's appearance and Blofeld's chilling words add to the sense of danger.
