Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to briefly fight back against the gunmen, suggesting he might find a way to outsmart Le Chiffre.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen, Le Chiffre's calm demeanor, and Bond's feeling of helplessness all contribute to a sense of impending danger and uncertainty about his fate.
