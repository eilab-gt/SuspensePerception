Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially caught off guard and seems trapped, his resourcefulness and fighting skills are established.  Fleming often sets up seemingly hopeless situations for Bond, only for him to find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack, and the description of the search and Le Chiffre's actions create a sense of unease and anticipation.  We know Bond is in trouble, but we're left wondering how he will escape.
