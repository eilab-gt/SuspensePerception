Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. His initial attempt to escape, though thwarted, demonstrates his willingness to fight back.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond in a vulnerable position, outnumbered and disarmed. The descriptions of the gunmen's actions and Le Chiffre's watchful gaze create a sense of impending danger.  The sudden shift to Bond's search for his watch adds a layer of mystery and raises the stakes.
