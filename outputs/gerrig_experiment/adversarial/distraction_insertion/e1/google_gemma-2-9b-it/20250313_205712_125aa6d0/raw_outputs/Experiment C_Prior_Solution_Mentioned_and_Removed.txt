Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently in a very precarious situation,  the passage hints at his resourcefulness. He managed to create a distraction and briefly gain the upper hand before being captured.  Bond's history suggests he's not one to give up easily.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and facing a ruthless opponent in Blofeld. The descriptions of Crushak's menacing presence and the threat of violence create a palpable sense of danger. The  unnatural elements (the missing flame, the sound of bells without a source) add a layer of unease and mystery, further heightening the suspense.
