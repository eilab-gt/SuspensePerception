Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely**

While Bond is currently in a precarious situation, he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past.  The distraction with the bird and his quick thinking suggest he might find another opportunity to escape. However, Blofeld seems to be one step ahead, and the presence of the menacing Crushak makes a straightforward escape unlikely.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial attempt to escape is thwarted, and the introduction of the brutal Crushak raises the stakes. The description of the wire tightening around Bond's arms adds a physical element of suspense.
