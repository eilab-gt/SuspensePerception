Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and skilled.  He managed to evade the gunmen initially and is likely to try and find a way out. However, Le Chiffre seems to be one step ahead, and Bond is disarmed and trapped.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the gunmen, Le Chiffre's calm demeanor, and Bond's helplessness create a sense of impending danger and uncertainty.
