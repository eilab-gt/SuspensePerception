Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and is being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation doesn't look promising for Bond's escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The description of the setting, the characters, and the actions creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen next. The use of vivid language, such as "large and very ugly man", "contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" adds to the suspenseful atmosphere.
