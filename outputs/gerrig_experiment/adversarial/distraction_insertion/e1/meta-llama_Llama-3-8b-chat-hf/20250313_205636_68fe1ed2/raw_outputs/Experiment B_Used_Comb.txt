Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped, surrounded by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and has been disarmed. He is at a disadvantage and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without some kind of plan or help.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dire situation for Bond. He is trapped, disarmed, and at the mercy of his captors. The use of vivid descriptions and the sudden and unexpected turn of events creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like anything could happen at any moment. The fact that Bond is feeling "puny and impotent" adds to the sense of desperation and raises the stakes, making the reader wonder how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen next.
