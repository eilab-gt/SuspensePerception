Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by Crushak, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak will be responsible for keeping Bond captive. This makes it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's clutches in the immediate future.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and Blofeld's ominous words and the presence of the large and ugly Crushak create a sense of foreboding. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large bird crashing into the wall of glass" and the "ugly man's contorted face", adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors.
