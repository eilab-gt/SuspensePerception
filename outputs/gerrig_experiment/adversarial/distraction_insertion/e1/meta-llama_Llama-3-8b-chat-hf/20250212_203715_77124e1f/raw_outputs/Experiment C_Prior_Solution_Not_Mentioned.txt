Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently trapped in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms, and he is being held captive by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is at the mercy of his enemies creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the reader feel like something dramatic and intense is about to happen.
