Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen, given that they have him outnumbered and disarmed. Bond has been caught off guard and is now at the mercy of his captors.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. Bond is trapped and disarmed, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "the candle flickered, but there was no flame", adds to the tension and creates a sense of unease. The reader is also left wondering what Le Chiffre's intentions are, which adds to the suspense.
