Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped, disarmed, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been caught off guard and is unable to defend himself, making it unlikely that he will escape in the immediate future.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of danger and tension. Bond, who was previously confident and in control, is suddenly caught off guard and trapped. The use of action and violence, such as the sudden burst of the door and the attack by the gunmen, creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The fact that Bond is disarmed and unable to defend himself adds to the sense of danger and suspense, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
