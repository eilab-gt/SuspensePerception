Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is facing a large and ugly man named Crushak who is devoted to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life. This doesn't look like a promising situation for Bond's escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped, and he is facing a formidable opponent in Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "very large and very ugly", adds to the sense of unease. The repetition of Blofeld's phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it" becomes annoying and adds to the sense of frustration and desperation. The overall atmosphere is dark and foreboding, making it extremely suspenseful.
