Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is currently trapped and pinned down by piano wire, and he is facing a large and ugly man named Crushak who is devoted to eliminating irritations from Blofeld's life. Additionally, Blofeld has a history of using his guards to harm or kill Bond, and it seems that Crushak will be responsible for Bond's care this time. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and he is facing a formidable opponent in Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large and ugly man, adds to the sense of unease. The repetition of Blofeld's phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it." creates a sense of distraction
