  Great, thank you for providing the passage! Here are my answers to your questions:

Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has managed to escape from similar traps in the past, the passage suggests that Blofeld has laid a successful trap for him this time, with Bond being tied up and left with two gunmen. It's unclear how Bond will manage to escape from this situation.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the build-up of tension create a sense of urgency and uncertainty, making it difficult to predict what will happen next.
