Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as "Somewhat likely". While Bond has managed to evade the gunmen and cause some damage, Le Chiffre seems to be a formidable opponent who has laid a successful trap for Bond. It's unclear at this point in the passage whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be captured.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as "Somewhat suspenseful". There is a sense of danger and urgency as Bond tries to evade the gunmen and find Vesper, but the passage doesn't quite reach the level of extreme suspense. The tension is building, but it's not yet at its highest point.
