Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?

I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

Bond has already been caught and disarmed by Le Chiffre's gunmen, and Le Chiffre himself seems to be taking a great deal of pleasure in Bond's predicament. It's unclear how Bond will be able to escape from this situation, and the passage doesn't provide any hints that he will be able to do so.

Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as:

7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is filled with tension and suspense as Bond tries to evade Le Chiffre's gunmen and find a way to escape. The use of vivid descriptions and quick, fluid language helps to build a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
