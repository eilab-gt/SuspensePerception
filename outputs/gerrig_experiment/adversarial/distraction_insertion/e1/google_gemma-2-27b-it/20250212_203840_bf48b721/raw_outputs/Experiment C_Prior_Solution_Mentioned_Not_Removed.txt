Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows resourcefulness by using the bird distraction and attempting to escape, he is quickly thwarted by Crushak. Blofeld's statement about his previous guard dying suggests a pattern of Bond escaping and the guards facing consequences. This implies a higher level of security and potential danger for Bond this time.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial escape attempt is exciting, but his capture and the introduction of the menacing Crushak create a sense of dread. Blofeld's calm demeanor and veiled threats add to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering what fate awaits Bond.
