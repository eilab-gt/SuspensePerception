Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued by Crushak. Blofeld's explicit instructions and Crushak's menacing presence suggest a difficult escape. However, Bond's history of resourceful escapes and the fact that this is a James Bond story leave some room for hope.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape is thwarted, and Blofeld's introduction of Crushak as a ruthless guard creates a palpable sense of danger. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and Blofeld's direct threat to Bond heighten the suspense.
