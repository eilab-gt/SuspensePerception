Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The passage emphasizes his agility and the fact that he was unharmed despite the attack. This suggests he might find a way to outsmart his captors.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The sudden ambush, Bond's initial struggle, and his ultimate capture create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" adds to the suspense, leaving the reader wondering how he will get out of this situation.
