Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages a momentary advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems prepared for Bond's tricks and has taken precautions.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's brief escape attempt is quickly thwarted, and Blofeld's calm demeanor and introduction of the menacing Crushak create a sense of impending danger. The mention of the previous guard's death adds to the suspense.
