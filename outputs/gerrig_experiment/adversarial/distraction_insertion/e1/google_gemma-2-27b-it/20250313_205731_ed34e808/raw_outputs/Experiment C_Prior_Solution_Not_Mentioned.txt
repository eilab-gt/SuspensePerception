Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning and manages to briefly gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and restrained. Blofeld seems to be in control and has taken precautions. However, Bond is resourceful and determined, so a complete escape seems unlikely at this point, but not impossible.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's initial attempt at escape, the sudden appearance of Crushak, and the menacing tone of Blofeld all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
