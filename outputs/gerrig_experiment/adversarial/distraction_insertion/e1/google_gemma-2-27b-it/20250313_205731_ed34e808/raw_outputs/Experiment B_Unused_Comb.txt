Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, he's shown resourcefulness and fighting ability in the past.  The excerpt emphasizes his agility and ability to recover from a fall. This suggests he might find a way to outsmart his captors.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a strong sense of danger and uncertainty. Bond is caught off guard, overpowered, and disarmed. Le Chiffre's menacing demeanor and the description of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" heighten the suspense.
