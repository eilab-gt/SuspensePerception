Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond manages to momentarily gain an advantage, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld seems prepared for Bond's tricks this time, and Crushak appears to be a formidable guard.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's brief escape attempt is quickly thwarted, and the introduction of Crushak as a ruthless guard creates a sense of danger. The mention of the previous guard's death adds to the suspense, suggesting that Bond is in a perilous situation.
