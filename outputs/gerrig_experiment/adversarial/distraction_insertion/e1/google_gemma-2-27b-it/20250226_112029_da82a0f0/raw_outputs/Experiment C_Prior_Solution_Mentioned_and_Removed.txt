Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld seems to be taking extra precautions this time, making a clean escape less likely. However, Bond is resourceful and determined, so a daring escape isn't entirely out of the question.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and outgunned. The description of Crushak's menacing appearance and Blofeld's cold threats create a palpable sense of danger. The repeated phrase "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it" adds a layer of mystery and urgency.
