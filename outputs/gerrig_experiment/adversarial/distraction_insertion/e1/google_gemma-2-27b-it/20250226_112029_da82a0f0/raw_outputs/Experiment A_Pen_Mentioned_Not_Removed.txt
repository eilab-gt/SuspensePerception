Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. The situation seems dire, but Bond's resourcefulness and the fact that this is an action-packed novel suggest a chance of escape, though it won't be easy.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and facing a dangerous adversary. The descriptions of Le Chiffre's actions and the quick, violent encounter in the passage create a sense of urgency and danger.
