Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and some fighting ability, he's outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and is actively taking away Bond's tools (revolver, pen).  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is in a dangerous situation, outnumbered and disarmed. The descriptions of Le Chiffre's actions and the gunmen's rough treatment of Bond create a sense of urgency and impending danger. The repetition of "He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it" adds to the suspense, hinting at a crucial element Bond is missing.
