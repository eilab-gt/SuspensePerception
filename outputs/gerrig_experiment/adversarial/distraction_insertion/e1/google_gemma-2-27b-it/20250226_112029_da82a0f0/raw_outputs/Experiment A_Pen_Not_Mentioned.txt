Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and fighting skills, he's outnumbered and outmaneuvered. The situation seems dire, but Bond's resourcefulness and determination suggest a slight chance of escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond is captured, outnumbered, and facing a dangerous adversary. The quick action, close calls, and Bond's internal thoughts ("He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.") all contribute to a high level of suspense.
