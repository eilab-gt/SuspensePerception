***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has shown some agility and quick thinking in the passage, he is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. It's unclear what opportunities Bond might have to escape, and the passage doesn't provide enough information to make a confident prediction.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger from the moment the door bursts open and the gunmen enter. The description of Bond's attempts to defend himself and his subsequent capture creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about what will happen to him next. The fact that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies adds to the suspense, making the reader wonder how he will escape or what will happen to him.
