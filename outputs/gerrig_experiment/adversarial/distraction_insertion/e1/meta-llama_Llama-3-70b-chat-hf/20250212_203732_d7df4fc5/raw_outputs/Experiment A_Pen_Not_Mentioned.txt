***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Bond trying to escape and doing some damage, but ultimately being caught and disarmed. It's unclear what will happen next, and Bond's chances of escape are uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond trying to escape and being caught, and the threat of violence and danger is palpable. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "slammed", "twisted sharply", and "roughly stripped" adds to the sense of urgency and intensity, making the passage very suspenseful.
