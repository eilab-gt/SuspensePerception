***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage shows Bond trying to make a move to escape, but being caught and disarmed by Le Chiffre's men. While Bond is a skilled agent, the situation seems dire, and it's unclear if he will be able to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, such as Bond's attempt to escape, the Corsican's quick reflexes, and the threat of violence from Le Chiffre's men. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape and what will happen to him and Vesper next. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "slammed", "twisted sharply", and "roughly stripped" adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
