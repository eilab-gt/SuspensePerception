"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThis answer is chosen because Bond is currently tied up by Crushak, and the text describes the wire as biting painfully into his flesh. Additionally, Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak is responsible for Bond this time, implying that Bond will face greater difficulty in escaping.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThis answer is chosen because the passage creates a sense of tension and danger. The bird crashing into the wall creates a sudden and unexpected distraction, and Bond's attempt to escape is thwarted by Crushak. The description of the wire biting into Bond's flesh adds to the sense of physical danger, and Blofeld's sinister tone and comments about his previous guard's death contribute to the overall suspenseful atmosphere."
