"***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is being held captive by two well-equipped and experienced individuals, Blofeld and Crushak. Bond is being physically restrained with piano wire, and Crushak has been tasked with ensuring Bond's confinement. This setup makes it unlikely that Bond will escape.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n7. Extremely suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is captured and restrained.
