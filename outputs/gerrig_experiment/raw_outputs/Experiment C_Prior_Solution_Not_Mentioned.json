"Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is in a difficult situation, surrounded by two armed men and securely tied to a chair. The use of piano wire to restrain him implies a high level of physical control, making it unlikely that he will escape easily.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is caught and restrained by Blofeld's henchman. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the \"large bird crashing into the wall\" and the \"ugly\" face of Crushak, adds to the sense of unease and foreboding, making the passage very suspenseful."
