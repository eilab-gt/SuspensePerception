"Question 1: 1. Not very likely\nBond is tied up with piano wire, and Crushak has orders to shoot him if he attempts to speak. This makes it unlikely that Bond will be able to escape or communicate with Crushak.\n\nQuestion 2: 6. Very suspenseful\nThe passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive and threatened with death. The description of Crushak as a large and ugly man, and the way he contorts his face into a smile, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The fact that Bond is tied up and unable to speak also raises the stakes and makes the reader wonder what will happen next."
