"Here are the answers to the questions based on the passage:\n\n***Question 1: \"How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?\"***\n1. Not very likely\n\nThe passage suggests that Bond is now in a difficult situation, with two guns pointed at him and being physically restrained by piano wire. The fact that Blofeld has taken measures to prevent Bond from escaping or even speaking to Crushak implies that Bond's chances of escape are low.\n\n***Question 2: \"How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?\"***\n6. Very suspenseful\n\nThe passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and precarious situation for Bond, with a large and intimidating figure holding him captive and threatening to shoot him if he speaks. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as the description of Crushak as \"very large and very ugly\" and the mention of a gun pointed at Bond's chest, adds to the sense of tension and suspense."
