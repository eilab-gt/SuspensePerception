Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain**

While Bond is clearly skilled and resourceful, he's currently disarmed and outnumbered. Le Chiffre seems to have anticipated Bond's every move and has him firmly in his grasp.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack.  The description of the struggle and Bond's capture leaves the reader wondering how he will escape this dangerous situation.
