Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently in a very vulnerable position. He's tied up, outnumbered, and under the direct threat of being shot.  Blofeld seems to have anticipated Bond's attempts to escape and has taken precautions. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is full of tension. Bond's brief moment of opportunity is quickly thwarted, and the introduction of the menacing Crusher adds a layer of immediate danger. The description of Bond being tied up and the threat of being shot creates a strong sense of anticipation and worry for his fate.
