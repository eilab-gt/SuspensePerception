Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly skilled and resourceful, he's currently disarmed and outnumbered. Le Chiffre seems to have anticipated Bond's every move and has him trapped.  The passage doesn't give us enough information to definitively say whether Bond will escape or not.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's initial confidence is shattered by the sudden attack. The description of the struggle and Bond's capture leaves the reader wondering how he will get out of this predicament. Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and the line "Let's not waste time" add to the sense of impending danger.
