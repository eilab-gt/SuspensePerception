Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain 

**Reasoning:** While Bond is clearly skilled and resourceful, he's currently disarmed and outnumbered. Le Chiffre seems to have anticipated Bond's every move and has him completely trapped.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Reasoning:**  The passage builds tension effectively. We see Bond's initial confidence shattered as he's ambushed. The description of the struggle and Bond's quick thinking keeps the reader on edge, wondering if he can escape Le Chiffre's clutches. The final line, "Bond felt puny and impotent,"  leaves the reader with a strong sense of foreboding.
