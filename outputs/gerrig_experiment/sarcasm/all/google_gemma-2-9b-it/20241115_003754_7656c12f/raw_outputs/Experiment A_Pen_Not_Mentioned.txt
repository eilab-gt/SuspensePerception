Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain** 

The excerpt presents a tense situation where Bond is clearly outnumbered and outmaneuvered. However, Bond is known for his resourcefulness and fighting skills. We don't have enough information to definitively say whether he will escape or not.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is packed with action and tension. Bond's sudden decision to fight, the quick exchange of blows, the description of the struggle, and Le Chiffre's calm, menacing presence all contribute to a heightened sense of suspense. We're left wondering what will happen next and if Bond can overcome this dangerous situation.
