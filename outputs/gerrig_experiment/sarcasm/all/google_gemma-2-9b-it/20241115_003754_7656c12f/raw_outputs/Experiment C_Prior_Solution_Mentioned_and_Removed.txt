Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently in a very precarious situation. He's outnumbered, tied up, and under the direct threat of death if he makes any move.  Blofeld seems to have anticipated Bond's cunning and has taken precautions to prevent another escape. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension. Bond's brief moment of opportunity is quickly thwarted, and the introduction of Crusher, a brutal enforcer, raises the stakes considerably. The threat of immediate violence and Blofeld's chilling words create a palpable sense of danger.
