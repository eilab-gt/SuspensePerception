Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Reasoning:** While Bond shows quick thinking and attempts to escape, the situation seems dire. He's captured, tied up, and Blofeld explicitly states that Crusher will be responsible for Bond this time, implying a more ruthless approach. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's attempt to escape, the sudden distraction, the arrival of Crusher, and Blofeld's menacing words all contribute to a feeling of anticipation and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
