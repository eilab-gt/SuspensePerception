Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 3. Slightly likely**

While Bond is resourceful and known for his escapes, he is currently in a very vulnerable position. He's outnumbered, physically restrained, and under the direct threat of being shot by the large and imposing Crusher.  Blofeld seems to have learned from his past mistakes and taken extra precautions.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage creates a lot of tension. Bond's initial attempt to escape is quickly thwarted, and he is left tied up and at the mercy of Crusher. Blofeld's cold demeanor and threat of violence, along with Crusher's ominous presence, heighten the suspense significantly. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament.
