Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Reasoning:** While Bond shows resourcefulness and quick thinking in the initial moments, he's clearly caught in a dangerous situation. Le Chiffre is aware of Bond's intentions and seems to be one step ahead.  We don't know the full layout of the situation or Bond's resources.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Reasoning:** The short, staccato sentences create a sense of urgency and immediacy.  We see Bond trying to act quickly, but he's clearly outmatched. The focus on physical details (like the description of the Corican's swift movement and Bond's concealed pen) heightens the tension.  The ending line, "Let's not waste time," suggests that danger is imminent.
