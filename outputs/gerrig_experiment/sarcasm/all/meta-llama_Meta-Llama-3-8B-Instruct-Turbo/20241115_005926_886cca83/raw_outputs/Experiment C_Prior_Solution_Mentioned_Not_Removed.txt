***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld, held in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and corners, which makes it quite difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has two gunmen, including the large and ugly man Crushak, who are likely to prevent Bond from escaping.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful as it describes Bond's capture and subsequent confinement by Blofeld, who has set a trap for him. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the sound of a bird crashing into the glass wall, the darkness of the office, and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, creates a sense of tension and fear, making the reader feel that Bond's situation is dire and that escape may be impossible.
