**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently trapped with Vesper and surrounded by Le Chiffre's two gunmen, who have disarmed him and are searching him for other weapons. Le Chiffre has also taken away Bond's comb and has the upper hand. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some sort of outside help or a clever plan.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dire situation for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and disarmed, and that Le Chiffre is a formidable opponent. The passage builds anticipation and anxiety as the reader wonders what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape. The use of vivid language and descriptive details adds to the suspense, making the passage feel intense and thrilling.
