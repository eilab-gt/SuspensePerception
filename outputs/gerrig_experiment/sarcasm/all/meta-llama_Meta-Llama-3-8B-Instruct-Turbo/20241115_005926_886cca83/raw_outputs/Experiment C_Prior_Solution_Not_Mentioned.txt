Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is now a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and is being restrained by piano wire. This is not a very favorable situation for Bond, and it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape on his own.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it builds a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The descriptions of the setting, the characters, and the actions create a sense of unease and fear, making it difficult to look away. The use of phrases like "A large bird crashed into the wall", "a very large and very ugly man", and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" adds to the sense of tension and danger.
