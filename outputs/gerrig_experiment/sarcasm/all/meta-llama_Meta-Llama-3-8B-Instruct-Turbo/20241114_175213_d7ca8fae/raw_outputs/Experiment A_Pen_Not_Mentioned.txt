**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are being held in a room. Le Chiffre has the upper hand, and Bond's plan to cause Le Chiffre to lose money has backfired. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from their current situation.
