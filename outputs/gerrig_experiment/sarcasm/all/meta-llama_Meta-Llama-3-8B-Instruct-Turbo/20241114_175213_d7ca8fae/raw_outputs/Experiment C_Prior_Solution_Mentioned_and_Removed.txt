***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive in a secure location. Blofeld has also taken measures to ensure that Bond cannot escape, such as pinning him down with piano wire and having his guns trained on him. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, and that Blofeld is determined to eliminate him. The use of vivid and intense language, such as the description of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.
