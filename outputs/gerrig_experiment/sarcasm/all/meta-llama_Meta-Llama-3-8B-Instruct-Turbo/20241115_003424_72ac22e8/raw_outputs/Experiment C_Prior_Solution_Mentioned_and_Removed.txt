***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. Blofeld has taken measures to ensure that Bond will not escape, such as pinning him down with piano wire and having Cruschak, the large and ugly man, pointing a gun at him. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from Blofeld's clutches.
