 Answer Question 1: 1 (Not very likely)

Bond and Vesper have been taken prisoner by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. They are currently being held against their will and are at the mercy of their captors. Blofeld has made it clear that he intends to keep them captive and has threatened to have them killed if they attempt to speak. Therefore, it is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from this situation on his own.

Answer Question 2: 6 (Very suspenseful)

The passage is very suspenseful due to the danger that Bond and Vesper are in. They have been unexpectedly captured by their enemies, and their fate is uncertain. The use of language, such as "He has orders to shoot you if you even attempt to speak," adds to the tension and sense of impending danger. The fact that Blofeld and Crushak have taken them prisoner in a large, dark office also creates an eerie and ominous atmosphere, which increases the suspense. Overall, the passage effectively creates a sense of uncertainty and danger, keeping the reader engaged and curious about what will happen next.
