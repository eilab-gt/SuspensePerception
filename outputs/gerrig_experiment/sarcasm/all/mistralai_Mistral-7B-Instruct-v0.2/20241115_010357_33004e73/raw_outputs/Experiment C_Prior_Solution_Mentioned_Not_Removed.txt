 Based on the provided passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. Bond has been overpowered and is currently being held captive in Blofeld's office. There are two armed men guarding him, and it seems that Blofeld has no intention of letting him go easily.

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it is moderately suspenseful. The reader is left wondering what Blofeld's plan is for Bond, and what will happen to Vesper, who is also mentioned in the passage but not currently present. The passage also includes elements of surprise, such as the appearance of the large bird crashing into the wall and the reveal of Crushak's true appearance. However, the fact that Bond has been captured and is at the mercy of his enemies does add a sense of urgency and danger to the situation.
