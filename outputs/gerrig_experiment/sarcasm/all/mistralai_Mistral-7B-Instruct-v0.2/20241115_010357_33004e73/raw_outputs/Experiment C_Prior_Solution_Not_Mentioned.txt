 Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the text, it appears that Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. Blofeld has shown no signs of leniency towards Bond and has made it clear that he intends to keep them captive. Additionally, the use of violence and the implication of further torture suggest that their situation is dire. Therefore, it is not very likely that Bond will escape at this moment.

As for the second question, the passage is very suspenseful. The tension is palpable as Bond and Vesper are captured, and the use of violent imagery and the threat of further harm only serves to increase the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next and how they will manage to escape from their predicament.
