 Answer Question 1: 1 (Not very likely)
Answer Question 2: 7 (Extremely suspenseful)

In this passage, Bond and Vesper have been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. They are at the mercy of their captors and it is unclear how they will escape. The description of Le Chiffre's men roughing up Bond and the use of tense language, such as "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins and brought a whisper of pain from him" and "He twisted Bond around roughly in search of other weapons," adds to the suspense. The fact that Le Chiffre seems to be enjoying the situation and is not wasting time also increases the tension. Overall, this passage is extremely suspenseful as the fate of Bond and Vesper is uncertain.
