 Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely
Answer Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage describes Bond and Vesper being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language, such as "Le Chiffre kept his gun trained on Bond's quiet chest," and "The corpse roughly stripped Bond's revolver out of its holster," creates a sense of tension and danger. The fact that Bond has been captured after successfully causing Le Chiffre to lose money adds to the suspense, as it raises the question of how Bond will escape or be rescued. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful as it leaves the reader wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper at the hands of Le Chiffre and his gunmen.
