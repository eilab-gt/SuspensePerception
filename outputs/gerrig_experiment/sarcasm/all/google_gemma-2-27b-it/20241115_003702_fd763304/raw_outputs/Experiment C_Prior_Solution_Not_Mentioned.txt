Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer:** 3. **Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and tied up.  Blofeld seems to be in complete control, and Crushak is described as a physically imposing and dedicated enforcer. This suggests Bond's escape won't be easy.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. **Very suspenseful**

The passage is written in a way that builds tension. The sudden bird incident, the darkness, the introduction of the menacing Crushak, and Blofeld's cold, calculated demeanor all contribute to a feeling of impending danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about the passage!
