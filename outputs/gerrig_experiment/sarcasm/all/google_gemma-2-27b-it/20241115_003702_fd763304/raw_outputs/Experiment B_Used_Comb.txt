Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Explanation:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and prepared.  The excerpt doesn't give us enough information to confidently say whether Bond will escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Explanation:** The passage builds suspense through several elements:

* **Sudden Ambush:** Bond is caught off guard, creating immediate tension.
* **Physical Struggle:** The fight, though brief, highlights the danger Bond is in.
* **Le Chiffre's Control:** Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and calculated actions emphasize Bond's vulnerability.
* **Bond's Impotence:** The final line, "Bond Felt Puny and Impotent," leaves the reader with a strong sense of unease and anticipation.
