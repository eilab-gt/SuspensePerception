Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:


***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

**2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is captured and seems to be in a tough spot, he is resourceful and skilled. He managed to momentarily take down one of the gunmen, demonstrating his fighting abilities. The passage also mentions Bond taking pride in his ability to right himself after falling. This suggests he's not easily defeated and might find a way out.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

**6. Very suspenseful**

The excerpt creates a strong sense of suspense.  

* **Sudden Attack:** Bond is suddenly attacked in his hotel room, immediately raising the stakes.
* **Violence:** The physical confrontation, including the description of Bond being shoved and twisted, adds to the tension.
* **Le Chiffre's Control:** Le Chiffre's calm demeanor and control over the situation create an atmosphere of danger and uncertainty.
* **Bond's Vulnerability:** The final line, "Bond felt puny and impotent," leaves the reader feeling uneasy about his fate.
