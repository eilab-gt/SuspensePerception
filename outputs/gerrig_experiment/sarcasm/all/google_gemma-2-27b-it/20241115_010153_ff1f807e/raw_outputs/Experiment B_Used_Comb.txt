Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

**2. Somewhat likely** 

While Bond is initially captured, he displays his trademark agility and resourcefulness. He's clearly underestimated Le Chiffre but hasn't lost his fighting spirit. This, coupled with his previous success against Le Chiffre, suggests he might find a way out.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond is caught off guard, outnumbered, and disarmed. Le Chiffre's smugness and the mention of Bond feeling "puny and impotent" heighten the suspense, leaving the reader wondering how Bond will overcome this dangerous situation.
