Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer:** 4. Neutral or Uncertain

**Explanation:** While Bond is resourceful and skilled, he's currently outnumbered and disarmed. Le Chiffre seems to be in control of the situation.  The excerpt ends on a note of Bond feeling "puny and impotent," suggesting the odds are not in his favor. However, it's a James Bond story, so a complete escape seems unlikely to be ruled out entirely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. Very suspenseful

**Explanation:** The passage is full of tension. The sudden intrusion, the fight, Bond's clever but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to fight back, and Le Chiffre's smug control all contribute to a high level of suspense. The ending leaves the reader wondering what Le Chiffre's plans are and how Bond will get out of this situation.
