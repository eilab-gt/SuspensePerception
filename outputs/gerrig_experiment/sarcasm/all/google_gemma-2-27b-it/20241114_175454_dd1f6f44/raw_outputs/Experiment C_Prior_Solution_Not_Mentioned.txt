Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer:** 3. **Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond shows some cunning by using the bird distraction, he is quickly subdued and bound. Blofeld seems to be in complete control and has a loyal enforcer in Crusher. However, this is a James Bond story, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape seemingly impossible situations. 

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. **Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a tense atmosphere through several elements:

* **Power Imbalance:** Blofeld is clearly in control, making Bond's situation seem dire.
* **Threat of Violence:** Crusher's description as "very large and very ugly" and his violent actions (tying up Bond painfully) heighten the sense of danger.
* **Uncertain Future:** Blofeld's parting words leave Bond's fate ambiguous, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next. 
* **Cliffhanger Ending
