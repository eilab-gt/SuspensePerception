Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer:** 3. **Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently bound and in a precarious situation, he's known for his resourcefulness and ability to think on his feet. The excerpt shows he's already attempted an escape, suggesting he won't give up easily. However, the presence of the formidable Crusher and Blofeld's determination make a successful escape seem challenging.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. **Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is written in a way that builds tension. The unexpected bird crashing through the window, the sudden darkness, the introduction of the menacing Crusher, and Blofeld's chilling words all contribute to a sense of danger and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering how Bond will get out of this situation.
