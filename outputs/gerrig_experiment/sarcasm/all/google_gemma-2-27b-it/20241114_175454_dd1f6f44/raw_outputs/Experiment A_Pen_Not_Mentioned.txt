Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

While Bond shows quick thinking and fighting skills, he's outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control and prepared for Bond's actions.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is written in a fast-paced, action-packed style. The use of short sentences, unexpected twists (like the Corsican's shoe-grabbing move), and Bond's precarious situation all contribute to a high level of suspense.
