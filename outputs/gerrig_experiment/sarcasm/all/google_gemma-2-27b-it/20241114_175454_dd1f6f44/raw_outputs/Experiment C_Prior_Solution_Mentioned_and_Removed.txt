Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer:** 3. **Slightly likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently in a precarious situation, tied up and under the watchful eye of a ruthless guard, he is James Bond. He's known for his resourcefulness, cunning, and ability to overcome seemingly impossible odds. The fact that Blofeld specifically mentions Bond outwitting a previous guard suggests Bond has a history of escaping captivity.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer:** 6. **Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is written in a way that builds tension.  

* **The unexpected bird crashing through the window:** This creates a moment of chaos and distraction, giving Bond a brief opportunity.
* **The introduction of Crusher:** The description of him as "very large and very ugly" immediately paints him as a formidable and potentially dangerous adversary.
* **Blofeld's cold and calculated demeanor:** His threats and instructions to Crusher highlight the seriousness of Bond's situation.
