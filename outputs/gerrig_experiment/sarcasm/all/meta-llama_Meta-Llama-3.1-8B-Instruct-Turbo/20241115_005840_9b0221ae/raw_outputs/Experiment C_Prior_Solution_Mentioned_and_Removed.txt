**Question 1:** 
Given that Bond and Vesper are the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, with one of them holding Bond in a wooden armchair by wrapping piano wire around his arms, it's clear that their situation is quite dire. The fact that Bond is captured, and his movements are restricted, makes it less likely for him to escape. Therefore, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

**Question 2:**
This passage is quite intense and suspenseful, with Bond and Vesper in a precarious situation, and their captors making it clear that they won't hesitate to harm them. The use of physical restraints, threats, and a dark atmosphere all contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere. Therefore, I would answer:

7. Extremely suspenseful
