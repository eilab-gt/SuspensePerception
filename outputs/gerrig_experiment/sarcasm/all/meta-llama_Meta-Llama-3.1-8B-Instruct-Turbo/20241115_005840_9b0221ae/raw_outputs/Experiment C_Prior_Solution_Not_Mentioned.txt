Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld and his two gunmen, as they have already captured him and taken Vesper prisoner. They are being handled by a large and ugly man named Mr. Cruschak who has forced Bond into a wooden armchair and pinned him in place with piano wire. This situation does not bode well for Bond's chances of escape.

Answer to Question 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful as it creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The use of active and descriptive language, such as "a very large and ugly man", "kNockInG oUt ThE lArGe LiGhT", and "tHe AiR", creates a vivid and intense atmosphere. The situation is also critical for Bond, and the outcome is uncertain, which adds to the suspense. Additionally, the sadistic nature of Blofeld and Cruschak creates a sense of unease and fear for Bond's well-being.
