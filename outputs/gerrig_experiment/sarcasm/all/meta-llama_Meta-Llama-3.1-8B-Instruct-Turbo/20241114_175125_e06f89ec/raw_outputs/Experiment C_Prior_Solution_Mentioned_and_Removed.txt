***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He is a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by wire. The fact that one of the gunmen, Crusshak, has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak, makes it even more challenging for Bond to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "Not very likely" (1).

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite suspenseful because it describes a tense and potentially deadly situation for Bond. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as "a very large and ugly man", "a large bird crashed into the wall of glass", and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being held captive and threatened with death also adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as "Extremely suspenseful" (7).
