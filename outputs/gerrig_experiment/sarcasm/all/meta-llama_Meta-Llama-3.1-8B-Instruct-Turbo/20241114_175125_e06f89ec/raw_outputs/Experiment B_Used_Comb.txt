***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are searching him. Le Chiffre is also taking control of Bond's pocket comb, which suggests that he has the upper hand. Therefore, I would say that it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

Answer: 1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being caught and searched by Le Chiffre and his men. The use of words like "burst in", "leapt through", "whirled around", and "twisted" creates a sense of action and urgency, which adds to the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being outsmarted by Le Chiffre and his men makes the situation even more tense and suspenseful.

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful
