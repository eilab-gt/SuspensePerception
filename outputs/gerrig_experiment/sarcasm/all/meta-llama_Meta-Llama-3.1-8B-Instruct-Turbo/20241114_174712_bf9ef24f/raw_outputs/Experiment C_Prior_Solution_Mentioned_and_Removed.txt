***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He is a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by wire. The fact that the wire is causing him pain and that the gunmen are threatening to shoot him if he attempts to speak suggests that his chances of escape are low. Therefore, I would answer:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is quite suspenseful because it describes a tense and potentially deadly situation. Bond is in a precarious position, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as the description of the large and ugly man, Crusshak, and the mention of the gun being pointed at Bond's chest, adds to the suspense. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being restrained and threatened suggests that he may be in grave danger. Therefore, I would answer:

7. Extremely suspenseful
