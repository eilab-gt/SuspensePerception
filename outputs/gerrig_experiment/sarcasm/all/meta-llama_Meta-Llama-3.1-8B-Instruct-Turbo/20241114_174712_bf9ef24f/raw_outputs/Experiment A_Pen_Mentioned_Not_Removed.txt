***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has managed to evade the two gunmen and has not been caught by Le Chiffre. However, he is still a prisoner and has been caught by Le Chiffre's assistant. Considering the situation, I would say that Bond's chances of escape are somewhat limited, but not impossible. Therefore, I would choose:

2. Somewhat likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is full of action, tension, and uncertainty, making it a thrilling and suspenseful read. The use of descriptive language, such as "Silent, Spidery summons" and "A backhanded kick which connected with the thin man's shins and brought a whistle of pain from him", creates a sense of intensity and raises the stakes for Bond. The fact that Bond is trying to escape from the two gunmen and Le Chiffre's assistant, while also trying to communicate with Vesper, adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would choose:

6. Very suspenseful
