**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

Although Bond is able to evade the first gunman and disarm him, he is still outnumbered and outgunned by Le Chiffre and his two henchmen. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond suggests that he has the upper hand. Additionally, Bond is caught by the second gunman and has his revolver stripped out of its holster. These factors make it unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, Bond. The use of descriptive language, such as "Le Chiffre's finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons" and "a sliver of pain from him", creates a sense of foreboding and raises the stakes for Bond. The action is fast-paced and intense, with Bond using his wits and physical skills to evade the henchmen and try to escape. The fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned adds to the sense of danger and suspense, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
