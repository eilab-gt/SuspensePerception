**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive in a secure office. Blofeld has already demonstrated his ability to trap Bond, and the large man, Crushak, is now pinning Bond down in a wooden armchair. Given these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. Therefore, the answer is:

1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
This passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for Bond. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and the description of the situation is vivid and intense. The use of words like "smiled" and "ugly" to describe Blofeld and Crushak adds to the sense of unease, and the fact that Bond is being pinned down and wired up to a chair creates a sense of claustrophobia and fear. Therefore, the answer is:

7. Extremely suspenseful
