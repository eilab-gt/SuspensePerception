**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**
1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive in a secure office with at least two guns pointed at them. The large man, Crustak, has also restrained Bond using piano wire. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape without some kind of intervention or help.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are in a precarious situation, and the use of descriptive language, such as the "large and ugly man" and the "painful" twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease. The passage also builds up to a sense of confrontation and violence, making it a thrilling and suspenseful read.
