***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, he is a skilled spy agent and has escaped from difficult situations before. It's possible that he will find a way to escape or turn the tables on Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of vivid descriptions and threats of violence adds to the suspense, making it feel like Bond's situation is very dire.
