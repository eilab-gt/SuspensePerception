***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful spy agent, and it is common for him to escape from difficult situations in the James Bond series.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond and Vesper are captured by Blofeld and his gunmen, and the description of Bond being tied up and at the mercy of his enemies creates a sense of suspense and uncertainty about his fate.
