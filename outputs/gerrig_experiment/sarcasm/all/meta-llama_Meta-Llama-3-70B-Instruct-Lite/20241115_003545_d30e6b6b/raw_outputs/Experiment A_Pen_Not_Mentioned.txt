I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful, with a sense of urgency and danger. The description of Le Chiffre's actions and Bond's situation creates a vivid and intense image, making the reader feel like they're right there with Bond, experiencing the tension and uncertainty.
