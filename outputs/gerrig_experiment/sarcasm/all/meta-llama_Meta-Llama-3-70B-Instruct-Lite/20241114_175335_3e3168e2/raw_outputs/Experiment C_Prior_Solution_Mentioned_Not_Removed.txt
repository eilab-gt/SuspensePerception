***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent who has managed to outsmart Blofeld before. It's likely that he will try to find a way to escape, and his skills and experience make it moderately likely that he will succeed.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond and Vesper being held captive by Blofeld and his henchmen. The description of the scene, including the sudden crash of the bird into the glass wall and the subsequent violence, adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. The fact that Bond is being tied up and at the mercy of his enemies raises the stakes and makes the reader wonder how he will manage to escape. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and engaging.
