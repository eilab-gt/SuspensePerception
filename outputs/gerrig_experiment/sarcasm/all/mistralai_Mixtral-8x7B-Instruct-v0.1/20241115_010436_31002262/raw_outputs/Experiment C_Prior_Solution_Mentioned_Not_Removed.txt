 Question 1: Based on the information provided, we know that Bond has been captured by Blofeld and is now tied up in a chair. Blofeld mentions that the last time Bond was in his captivity, he managed to outwit the guard, but this time, Blofeld has assigned a man named Crushak to ensure Bond does not escape. Given these details, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation, and while it's possible that he may find a way to escape, it's not certain. Therefore, I would answer "somewhat likely" or "slightly likely" for this question.

Question 2: The passage sets up a tense and suspenseful situation, with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld and his henchman. The author describes the scene in detail, including the large bird crashing into the window and the sound of Blofeld's gunshot. These details help to create a sense of danger and uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next. Overall, I would rate the passage as "moderately suspenseful" or "very suspenseful" depending on individual reader's sensitivity to suspense.
