 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and dangerous situation, being trapped by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, considering Bond's skills and experience as a secret agent, it's possible that he could find a way to escape. I would rate the likelihood as "somewhat likely" (2).

Question 2: The passage describes a sudden turn of events where Bond is attacked and overpowered, which can certainly create a sense of suspense. However, without knowing the full context or what happens next, it's difficult to accurately gauge the level of suspense. Based on this passage alone, I would rate it as "moderately suspenseful" (5).
