 Answer Question 1: Based on the passage provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being tied up and under the watch of Blofeld's men. However, it is important to remember that Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent, capable of finding a way out of seemingly impossible situations. That being said, we do not have enough information to definitively determine the likelihood of Bond's escape.

Answer Question 2: I find this passage to be moderately suspenseful. While we know that Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, the fact that he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld's men creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. Additionally, the passage describes how Blofeld is no longer amused by Bond's attempts to outsmart him and has taken steps to prevent Bond from doing so again. This adds to the suspense and raises the stakes for Bond's escape.
