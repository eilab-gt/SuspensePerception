 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being tied up by Blofeld's large and ugly henchman, Crushak. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, it is still possible that he might find a way to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "moderately likely" (option 5).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and uncertain situation, where Bond's fate is in the hands of his enemy, Blofeld. The fact that Bond has previously escaped from Blofeld's captivity only adds to the suspense, as the reader wonders whether he will be able to do so again. Therefore, I would rate the suspense level as "very suspenseful" (option 6).
