 Answer:

Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might assume that he has a moderate to high chance of escaping. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately likely."

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, in which Bond is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The level of suspense in the passage is quite high, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape. Therefore, I would choose option 6, "Very suspenseful."
