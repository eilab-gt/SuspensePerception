 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is in a challenging and dangerous situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, the passage does not provide enough information to accurately determine the likelihood of Bond escaping. Bond does show some resourcefulness in trying to protect himself and Vesper, but it is unclear if or how he plans to escape. Therefore, I would answer '4. Neutral or Uncertain'.

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, in which Bond and Vesper are in danger of being harmed by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The level of suspense can be subjective and may depend on the reader's familiarity with the James Bond series and their expectations for the story. However, based on the information provided in the passage, I would answer '5. Moderately suspenseful'. The situation is uncertain and potentially dangerous, which can create suspense for the reader.
