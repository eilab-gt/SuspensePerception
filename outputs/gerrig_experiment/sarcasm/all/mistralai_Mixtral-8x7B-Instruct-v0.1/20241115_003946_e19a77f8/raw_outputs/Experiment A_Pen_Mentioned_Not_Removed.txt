 Answer:

Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one may assume that he has a moderate to high chance of escaping. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately likely."

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond being held captive and his gun being taken away. This level of danger and uncertainty can be considered suspenseful. Therefore, I would choose option 6, "Very suspenseful."
