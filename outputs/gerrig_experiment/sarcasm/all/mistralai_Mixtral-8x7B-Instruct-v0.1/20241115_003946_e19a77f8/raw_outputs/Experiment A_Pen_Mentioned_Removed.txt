 Answer:

Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and past experiences, one might assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping from this situation. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately likely."

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond and Vesper are being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The level of suspense in this passage is quite high, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape. Therefore, I would choose option 6, "Very suspenseful."
