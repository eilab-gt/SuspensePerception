***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, James Bond is a skilled and resourceful secret agent who has escaped from similar situations in the past. It's likely that he will find a way to escape, but it's not a guarantee.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and the reader is left wondering how he will escape. The use of descriptive language, such as the sound of the bird crashing into the glass wall and the darkness of the office, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The fact that Bond is being tied up and threatened by Blofeld and Crushak also increases the sense of danger and tension.
