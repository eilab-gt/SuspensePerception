***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his gunmen, the passage does not provide any conclusive evidence that Bond will not escape. In fact, Bond's character is known for his cunning and ability to get out of tight spots. The passage even hints at Bond's attempt to take advantage of a distraction earlier, which suggests that he is already thinking of ways to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his enemies, and the reader is left wondering if he will escape or be killed. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the crashing bird and the dark office, adds to the sense of unease and tension. The fact that Bond is being tied up and threatened by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
