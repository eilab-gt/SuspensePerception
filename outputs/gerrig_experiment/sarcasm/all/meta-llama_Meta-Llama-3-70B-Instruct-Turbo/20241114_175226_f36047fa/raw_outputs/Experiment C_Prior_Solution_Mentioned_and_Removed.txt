***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. Although the passage presents a dire scenario with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape, given his character's reputation and the genre of the novel.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the description of Bond's precarious situation, the menacing tone of Blofeld, and the physical restraint of Bond by CrUsHaK. The use of vivid language, such as "pAiNfUlLy InTo BoNd'S fLeSh" and "lOoK nO lEsS uGlY", adds to the sense of unease and foreboding. The passage effectively builds suspense by creating a sense of danger and uncertainty, leaving the reader wondering how Bond will escape from this predicament.
