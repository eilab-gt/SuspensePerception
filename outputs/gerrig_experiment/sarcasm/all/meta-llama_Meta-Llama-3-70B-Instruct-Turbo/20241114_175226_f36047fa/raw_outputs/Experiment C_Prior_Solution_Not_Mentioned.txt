***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

This is because James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his ability to escape from difficult situations. Although he is currently a prisoner of Blofeld, it is likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense as Bond is trapped by Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language, such as the sound of the bird crashing into the glass wall and the darkness of the office, adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is being tied up and left to contemplate his "rude behavior" creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about what will happen to him next, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
