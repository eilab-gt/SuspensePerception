***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, Bond is a skilled and resourceful secret agent. He has managed to outsmart Blofeld before, causing him to lose a considerable amount of money gambling. While the situation looks dire, Bond's abilities and experience suggest that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is full of tense and suspenseful moments, from the sudden crash of a bird into the glass wall to Bond's attempt to make a break for the door, only to be met by Blofeld's henchman, Mr. Crushak. The use of descriptive language, such as the darkness of the office and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the sense of tension and danger. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape from his predicament, making the passage very suspenseful.
