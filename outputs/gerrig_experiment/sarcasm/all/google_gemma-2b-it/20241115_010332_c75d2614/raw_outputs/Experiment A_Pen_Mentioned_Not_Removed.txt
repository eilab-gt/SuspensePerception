The passage is somewhat suspenseful. It describes Bond's escape attempt in a fairly detailed manner, and it leaves the reader wondering whether he will be able to successfully evade Le Chiffre. However, the passage is not overly long or detailed, and it does not provide a lot of clues about how Bond will be able to escape.
