I will answer the two questions.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

6. Very likely

The passage shows Bond being caught and restrained by Blofeld's men, but it's essential to consider the overall context of the James Bond series. Bond is known for his resourcefulness, intelligence, and ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations. Given his past successes in evading capture, it is very likely that Bond will find a way to escape from Blofeld's clutches.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tense moments that create a high level of suspense. Bond is caught and restrained by Blofeld's men, and his situation appears dire. The presence of the gunmen and the sadistic nature of CrUsHaK add to the sense of danger and foreboding. The use of physical restraint and pain, as demonstrated by the piano wire wrapped around Bond's arms, heightens the tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape this situation, which creates an extremely suspenseful atmosphere.
