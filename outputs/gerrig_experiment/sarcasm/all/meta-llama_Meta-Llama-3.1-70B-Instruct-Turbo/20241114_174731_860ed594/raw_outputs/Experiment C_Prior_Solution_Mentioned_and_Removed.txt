***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. 

Although Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his henchmen, the passage does not provide any conclusive evidence that Bond's situation is hopeless. In fact, the passage shows Bond attempting to take advantage of a distraction to escape, which suggests that he is still resourceful and determined to escape. Additionally, the passage is from a James Bond novel, and it is typical for Bond to find a way to escape from seemingly impossible situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful.

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense by describing Bond's desperate attempt to escape from Blofeld's henchmen. The use of vivid imagery, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the sound of the gun firing, adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The passage also raises questions about Bond's fate, such as whether he will be able to escape or if he will be killed by
