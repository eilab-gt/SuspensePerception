***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage describes Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, it is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations. The passage also highlights Bond's quick thinking and agility, as he manages to minimize the damage from the initial attack. Given Bond's character and the genre of the novel, it is likely that he will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful, as it describes a sudden and violent attack on Bond, and his subsequent capture by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of action verbs like "bUrSt", "LeApT", and "TwIsTeD" creates a sense of urgency and intensity, and the description of Bond's attempts to defend himself adds to the tension. The passage also ends with Bond feeling "PuNy AnD iMpOtEnT", which creates a sense of uncertainty
