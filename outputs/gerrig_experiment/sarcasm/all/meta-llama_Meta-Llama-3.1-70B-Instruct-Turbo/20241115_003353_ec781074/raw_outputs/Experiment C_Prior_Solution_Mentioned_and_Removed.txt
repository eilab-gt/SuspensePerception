***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate it as 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently tied up and being held captive by Blofeld and his henchmen, the fact that he was able to take advantage of a distraction earlier and attempt to escape suggests that he is resourceful and determined. Additionally, Bond is a skilled secret agent, and it's likely that he will find a way to escape or be rescued.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate it as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive and threatened by Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of descriptive language, such as the large and ugly man, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is unable to speak or move also creates a sense of vulnerability, which adds to the suspense.
