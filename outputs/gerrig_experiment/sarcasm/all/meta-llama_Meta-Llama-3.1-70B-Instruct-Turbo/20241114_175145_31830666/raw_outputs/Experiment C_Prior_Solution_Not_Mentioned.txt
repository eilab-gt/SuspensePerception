***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage shows Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Mr. Crushak, it is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations. The passage does not provide any information that would suggest Bond's escape is impossible, and it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape and turn the tables on Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful as it shows Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman, and it creates a sense of tension and danger. The use of descriptive language, such as the large bird crashing into the wall of glass, and the image of Mr. Crushak's ugly face contorted into a smile, adds to the suspense and creates a sense of unease. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond next, and whether he will be able to escape, which adds to the suspense.
