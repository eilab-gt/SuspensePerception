 Based on the passage, it seems that Bond's chances of escaping from Le Chiffre are not very likely. Bond has been captured and is being held as a prisoner by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. Bond's plan to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and exchange a few hurtful words with the girl has failed, and he is now being held captive.

As for the level of suspense, the passage is moderately suspenseful. The description of Bond being captured and held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of danger and uncertainty. The fact that Bond has been captured and is being held captive by a criminal figure who is determined to get revenge adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not contain any major twists or turns that would make it extremely suspenseful.
