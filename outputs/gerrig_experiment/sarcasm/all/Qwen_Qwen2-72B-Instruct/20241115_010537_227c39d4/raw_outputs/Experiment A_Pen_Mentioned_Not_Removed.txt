Question 1: Based on the excerpt provided, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre seems moderately likely. Despite being captured, Bond has shown resourcefulness and an intent to fight back. He is still thinking on his feet and attempting to communicate with Vesper, suggesting he has a plan in mind. However, he is currently outnumbered and outgunned, which makes the situation precarious. Therefore, the answer is 5. Moderately likely.

Question 2: The passage is extremely suspenseful. The tension is high as Bond has been captured and is attempting to escape or at least communicate with Vesper. The descriptions of the actions and the detail of Bond's movements and thoughts create a sense of urgency and danger. Therefore, the answer is 7. Extremely suspenseful.
