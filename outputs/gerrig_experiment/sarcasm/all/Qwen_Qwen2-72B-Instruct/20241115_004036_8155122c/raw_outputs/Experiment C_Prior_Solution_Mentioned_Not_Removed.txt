***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the excerpt, it appears that Bond is in a precarious situation. He has just been overpowered by Crushak, who has bound him with piano wire, causing him pain and restricting his movement. Given this immediate constraint and the presence of Blofeld and Crushak, both of whom are determined to keep Bond captive, it seems that Bond's chances of escaping are not very high at this moment. However, considering Bond's history of resourcefulness and the unpredictable nature of his adventures, it would be unwise to completely rule out the possibility of his escape. Therefore, the answer would be:

4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is quite suspenseful. It describes Bond's desperate attempt to escape, which is thwarted by Crushak's intervention. The detail about the painful binding with piano wire and the ominous threat from Blofeld about Crushak's responsibility for Bond this time adds to the tension. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to get out of this situation, if at all, which is a hallmark of a suspenseful narrative.
