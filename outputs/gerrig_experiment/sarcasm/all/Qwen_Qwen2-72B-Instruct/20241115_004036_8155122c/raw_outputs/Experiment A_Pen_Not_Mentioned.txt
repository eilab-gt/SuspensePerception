Question 1: Given the excerpt and the situation described, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond's escape with certainty. However, based on Bond's history of resourcefulness and the fact that he is actively trying to resist and communicate with Vesper, one could argue that his escape is moderately likely. So, the answer would be:

5. Moderately likely

Question 2: The passage is quite suspenseful as it describes a critical moment where Bond is captured and is trying to act quickly to protect himself and Vesper. The action and the uncertainty of the outcome contribute to a high level of suspense. Therefore, the answer would be:

7. Extremely suspenseful
