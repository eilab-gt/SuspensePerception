***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, he is currently restrained and under the watchful eye of a large and presumably strong man, Mr. Crushak, who has orders to shoot Bond if he even attempts to speak. The situation is tense, and Bond's fate is uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with suspense as it describes Bond's desperate attempt to escape and the immediate danger he faces from Crushak, who is armed and ready to shoot. The use of piano wire to bind Bond adds a sense of brutality and finality to the situation, heightening the tension. The fact that Bond's fate is uncertain and that he is at the mercy of his captors makes the passage very suspenseful.
