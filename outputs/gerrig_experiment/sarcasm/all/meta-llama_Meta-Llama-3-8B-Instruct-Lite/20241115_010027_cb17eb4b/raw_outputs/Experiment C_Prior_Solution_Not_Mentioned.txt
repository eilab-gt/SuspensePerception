**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Cruschak and others. They are being held captive and are at the mercy of their captors. Given their current situation, it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape on his own.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is highly suspenseful because it's clear that Bond and Vesper are in grave danger. They are trapped, and the situation is escalating quickly. The use of descriptive language, such as the sound of the large bird crashing into the wall, adds to the tension and creates a sense of urgency. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and if Bond and Vesper will be able to escape. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia, with Bond being forced into a wooden armchair and having piano wire wrapped around his arms, making it even more tense and suspenseful.
