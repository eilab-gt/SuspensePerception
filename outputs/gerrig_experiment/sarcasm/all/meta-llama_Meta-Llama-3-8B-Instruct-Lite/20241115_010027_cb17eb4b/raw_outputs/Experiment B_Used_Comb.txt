Answer 1: **1. Not very likely**

The passage describes Bond and Vesper being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and Bond being pinned down and unable to escape. The tone of the passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious and disadvantageous situation, making it unlikely that he will escape immediately.

Answer 2: **6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is extremely suspenseful due to the sudden and unexpected turn of events, where Bond is captured and pinned down by the villains. The use of descriptive language, such as "cruel smile" and "pulled out Bond's pocket comb and ran his finger down its teeth", adds to the tension and sense of danger. The reader is left with a sense of unease and concern for Bond's fate, making the passage highly suspenseful.
