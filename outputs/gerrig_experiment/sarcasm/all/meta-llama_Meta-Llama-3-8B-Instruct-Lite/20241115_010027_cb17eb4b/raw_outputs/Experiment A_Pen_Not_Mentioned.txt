Answer 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

I would choose option 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it seems like he is at a disadvantage. He is also injured and disarmed, which makes his chances of escape seem low.

Answer 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I would choose option 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and ominous descriptions, and the reader can sense that Bond is in grave danger. The fact that Bond is trapped and disarmed, and that Le Chiffre is gloating, creates a sense of foreboding that is intense and suspenseful. The passage is also full of action and quick movements, which adds to the sense of tension and suspense. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of urgency and danger, making it extremely suspenseful.
