Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Cruskha and the large, ugly man. He is being held captive and is in a vulnerable position, making it unlikely that he will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of descriptive language, such as "a Large Bird Crashed into the Wall of Glass", "a Large and Ugly Man", and "Each subsequent Twist of the Wire Bit more Painfully into Bond's Flesh", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what will happen to Bond and Vesper.
