**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and the passage suggests that he is at a disadvantage. Le Chiffre seems to have the upper hand, and Bond is being treated roughly and humiliated. It's unlikely that Bond will escape from this situation without some kind of dramatic turn of events.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the description of the scene is vivid and intense. The use of words like "trapped", "gunmen", "roughly stripped", and "humiliated" creates a sense of urgency and fear, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing his ordeal. The passage also raises questions about how Bond will escape and what will happen to him, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.
