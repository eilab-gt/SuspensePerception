Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Cruschak and the large and ugly man. This situation makes it unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and helpless, and are at the mercy of their captors. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as "the large and ugly man", "the bird crashed into the wall", and "each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper, and whether they will be able to escape from their captors.
