 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has successfully captured Bond and Vesper, and has them at his mercy. He has also set up a trap for Bond, which involves losing a considerable amount of money gambling. While Bond has managed to hurt Le Chiffre's business, he is still in Le Chiffre's control.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there are no major plot twists or surprises, the situation that Bond and Vesper find themselves in is dangerous and uncertain. The passage also sets up a sense of tension and conflict between Bond and Le Chiffre, which adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not build up the suspense to an extreme level.
