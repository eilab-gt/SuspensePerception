Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:**  While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. His initial attempt to escape, though thwarted, demonstrates his willingness to fight back.  Fleming's writing often suggests Bond's ability to overcome seemingly impossible odds, but this situation is precarious.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:**  The passage is packed with tension. We have Bond trapped, outnumbered, and facing a cunning adversary in Le Chiffre. The short, choppy sentences and the descriptions of physical action ("A backward kick," "He slammed himself back against the wall," "He caught Bond's shoe...") create a sense of urgency and danger.  The ending, with Le Chiffre taking Bond's fountain pen, leaves the reader wondering what he intends to do with it and how Bond will react.
