Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently in a precarious situation, he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past.  He managed to create a distraction and briefly escape, even though he was quickly apprehended.  This suggests he's not easily defeated and will likely try to find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Blofeld and his menacing henchman, Crusher.  The description of Bond's struggle and the threat of violence create a sense of urgency and anticipation.
