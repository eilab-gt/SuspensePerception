Here are my answers based on the provided passage:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond is resourceful and has a history of escaping tight spots, he's currently tied up and under the watchful eye of a dedicated and intimidating guard, Crusher. The odds aren't in his favor, but it's James Bond, so a complete write-off is unlikely.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds tension effectively.  

* **Blofeld's menacing demeanor:** His dialogue is chilling, and his casual dismissal of Bond's previous escape is unsettling.
* **The introduction of Crusher:** Described as "very large and very ugly," he immediately establishes himself as a formidable threat.
* **Bond's capture:** The detailed description of Bond being tied up with piano wire emphasizes his vulnerability.
* **Blofeld's final words:** The mention of Bond's previous escape and the guard's subsequent death creates a sense of foreboding.
