Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**3. Slightly likely** 

While Bond shows quick thinking and fighting prowess, he's outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre seems to be in control of the situation.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is written in a fast-paced, action-packed style. The use of short sentences and dramatic descriptions ("Like lightning", "whistle of pain", "crashed to the ground") create a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to outsmart his captors.
