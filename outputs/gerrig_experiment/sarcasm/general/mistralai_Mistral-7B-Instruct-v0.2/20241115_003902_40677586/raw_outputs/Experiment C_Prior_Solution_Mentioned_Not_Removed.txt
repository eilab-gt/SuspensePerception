 Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"
1. Not very likely

The passage describes Bond and Vesper being taken prisoner by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushek. Blofeld expresses his displeasure with Bond's interference in his plans and seems determined to keep them captive. There is no indication that Bond has an opportunity to escape or that he is making any attempts to do so.

Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
5. Moderately suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and uncertainty as Bond and Vesper are taken captive by Blofeld. The description of Crushek and the threat he poses to Bond adds to the suspense. However, the passage does not provide enough information to fully engage the reader's suspense or to create a sense of imminent danger.
