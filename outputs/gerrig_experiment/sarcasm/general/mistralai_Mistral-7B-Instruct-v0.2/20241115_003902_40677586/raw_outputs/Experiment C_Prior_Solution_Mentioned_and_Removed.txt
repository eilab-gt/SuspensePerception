 Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage describes Bond and Vesper being captured by Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The suspense comes from the fact that Bond has managed to ruin Blofeld's gambling business but has now fallen into the criminal's trap. The description of the large, ugly Crushak and the threat of violence against Bond increases the tension and uncertainty about their fate. The fact that Blofeld mentions having held Bond captive before and having let him go adds to the suspense, as it suggests that Bond may not escape this time.
