 Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper have been taken prisoner by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. They have been overpowered and are currently at the mercy of their captors. It is unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of intervention or assistance.

Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful as Bond and Vesper have been captured, and the reader is unsure of what will happen to them next. The use of descriptive language and the tension created by the situation adds to the suspense. The fact that Bond is able to defend himself against one of the gunmen but is still outnumbered and outmatched adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty.
