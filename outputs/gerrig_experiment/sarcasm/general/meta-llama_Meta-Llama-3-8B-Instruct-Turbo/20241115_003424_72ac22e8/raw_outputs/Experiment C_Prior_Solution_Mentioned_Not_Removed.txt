I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are currently prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive in a secure location. Blofeld has taken measures to ensure their capture, and it seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some sort of plan or assistance.
