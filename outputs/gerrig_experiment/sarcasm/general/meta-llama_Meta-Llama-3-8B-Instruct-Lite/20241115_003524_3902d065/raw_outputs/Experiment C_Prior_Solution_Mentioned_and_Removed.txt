Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will escape from this predicament.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors, and the descriptions of the setting and the actions of the characters create a sense of foreboding. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as "the large bird crashed into the wall of glass", "the large and ugly man", and "the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what will happen next.
