Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, CruschaK and others, and is being held captive in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and legs, which is a very difficult situation for him to escape from. The fact that Blofeld has a personal vendetta against Bond and is determined to punish him also makes it less likely that Bond will escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is aware that he is in grave danger. The use of vivid and ominous descriptions, such as the "Large and ugly man", "a piece of piano wire around each of the chair's corners and Bond's arms", and "the light from the hall spilled in, revealing another gun pointing at his chest", adds to the suspense. The passage also creates a sense of foreboding, as the reader is aware that Bond is at the mercy of his captors and that his situation is dire.
