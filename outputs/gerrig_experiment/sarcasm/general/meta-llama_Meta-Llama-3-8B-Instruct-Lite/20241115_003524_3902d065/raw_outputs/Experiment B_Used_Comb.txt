Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond also implies that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of their captors, and the description of the scene is vivid and intense. The use of words like "burst", "leapt", "caughed", and "twisted" creates a sense of urgency and chaos, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing the events unfolding. The fact that Le Chiffre is smiling and flippant, while Bond is feeling puny and impotent, adds to the sense of unease and suspense.
