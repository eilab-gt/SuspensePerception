 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond's escape from Le Chiffre. However, considering that Bond is currently a prisoner and has already been attacked by Le Chiffre's gunmen, it can be inferred that his chances of escape are not very high at the moment. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 1. Not very likely.

Regarding the suspensefulness of the passage, the description of Bond's attempted escape and subsequent capture by Le Chiffre's gunmen creates a sense of tension and uncertainty. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond and Vesper will be able to escape from their captors. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of the passage as 6. Very suspenseful.
