***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is in a precarious situation, being a skilled secret agent, it's likely that he will find a way to escape or turn the tables on Blofeld. However, the passage doesn't provide any clear hints or clues that would suggest an easy escape, so it's not extremely likely either.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The description of the scene, including the sudden crash of the bird into the glass wall, adds to the sense of surprise and danger. The conversation between Blofeld and Bond is also ominous and foreboding, making the reader feel that Bond is in grave danger. Overall, the passage effectively builds suspense and tension, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
