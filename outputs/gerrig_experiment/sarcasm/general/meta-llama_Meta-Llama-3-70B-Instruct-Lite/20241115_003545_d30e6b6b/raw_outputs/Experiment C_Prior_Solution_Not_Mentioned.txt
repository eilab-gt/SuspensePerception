***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from tight spots. The passage doesn't provide any clear indication that Bond's situation is hopeless, so it's reasonable to assume that he might find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The description of the scene, including the sudden interruption by the large bird crashing into the wall of glass, adds to the sense of tension and unpredictability. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and how he will manage to escape.
