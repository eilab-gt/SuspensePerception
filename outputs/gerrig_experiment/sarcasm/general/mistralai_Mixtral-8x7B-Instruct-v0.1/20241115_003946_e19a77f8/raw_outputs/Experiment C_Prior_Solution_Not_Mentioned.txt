 Question 1: Based on the passage, we know that Bond has been captured by Blofeld and is now tied up in a chair. Bond's situation seems dire, and there's no indication that he has any means of escape at the moment. However, since this is a work of fiction and Bond is the main character, it's likely that he will find a way to escape eventually. With that said, based on the information provided in this passage alone, I would answer "Somewhat likely" (2) to the question of how likely it is that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and suspenseful scene where Bond has been captured by Blofeld and is now tied up in a chair. The stakes are high, and the situation seems dire, which adds to the suspense. Additionally, the author uses descriptive language to create a vivid image of the scene, which further enhances the suspense. Therefore, I would answer "Very suspenseful" (6) to the question of how suspenseful I find this passage to be.
