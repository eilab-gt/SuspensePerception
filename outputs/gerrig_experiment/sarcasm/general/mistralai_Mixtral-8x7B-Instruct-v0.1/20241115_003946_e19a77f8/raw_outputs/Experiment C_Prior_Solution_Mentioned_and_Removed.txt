 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, it seems that Bond is currently captured and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. However, Bond has a history of escaping from seemingly impossible situations. Considering this, I would answer 'moderately likely' to the question 'How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?'.

Answer Question 2: The excerpt describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond and Vesper are at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. The fact that Bond is tied up and threatened with death if he speaks adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would answer 'very suspenseful' to the question 'How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?'.
