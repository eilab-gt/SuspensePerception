 Question 1: Based on the information provided, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being trapped and outnumbered by Le Chiffre and his men. However, Bond has already shown his skills and resourcefulness in the passage, so it's possible that he could find a way to escape. Given the limited context, I would answer "somewhat likely" for this question.

Question 2: Without the actual passage provided, I am unable to answer this question. However, based on the description of the situation in the question prompt, it seems like there could be a sense of suspense as to whether Bond will be able to escape or not. Therefore, I would estimate that the passage is "moderately suspenseful" for an average reader.
