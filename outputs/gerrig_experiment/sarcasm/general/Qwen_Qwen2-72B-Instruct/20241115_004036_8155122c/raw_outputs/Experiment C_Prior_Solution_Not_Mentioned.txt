***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. While Bond has shown resourcefulness by using the distraction of the bird to attempt an escape, he is now tied up with piano wire and guarded by the large and ugly man, Mr. Crushak. The situation is precarious, and the outcome uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with suspense as it describes Bond's desperate attempt to escape from Blofeld, only to be thwarted and tied up by Crushak. The use of the bird as a distraction, the dimly lit office, and the menacing presence of Crushak all contribute to a sense of impending danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
