***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Given the excerpt, it seems that Bond is currently in a precarious situation, having been caught off guard and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his men. Bond's quick reflexes and agility have allowed him to avoid immediate harm, but he is now trapped and at the mercy of his captors. While Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape tight spots, the immediate likelihood of his escape appears to be 4. Neutral or Uncertain, as there is no clear indication in the passage that an escape is imminent or even likely at this moment.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is 7. Extremely suspenseful. It captures a high-stakes moment where Bond, having just defeated Le Chiffre in a gambling context, is suddenly ambushed and finds himself in a dangerous and unexpected situation. The tension is heightened by Bond's sudden change in fortune and the uncertainty of his fate, making the scene very suspenseful.
