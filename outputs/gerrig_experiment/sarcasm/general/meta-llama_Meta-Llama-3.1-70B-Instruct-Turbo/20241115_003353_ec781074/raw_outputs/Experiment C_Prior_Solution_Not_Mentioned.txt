***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Given the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as '5. Moderately likely'. Although Bond has been captured and tied up by Blofeld's men, James Bond is a skilled spy known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations. However, the passage does not provide any immediate opportunities for Bond to escape, making it uncertain but not impossible.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as '6. Very suspenseful'. The passage creates a tense atmosphere with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall, and the detailed description of Bond being tied up with piano wire, adds to the sense of danger and urgency. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this situation, making the passage very suspenseful.
