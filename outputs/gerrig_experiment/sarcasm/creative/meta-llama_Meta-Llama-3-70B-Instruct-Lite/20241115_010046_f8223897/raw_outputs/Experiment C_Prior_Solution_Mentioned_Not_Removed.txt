***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Since Bond is a skilled secret agent, it's possible that he might find a way to escape. However, considering the current situation where he is trapped and restrained by Blofeld's henchmen, it's not extremely likely. I would rate it as:

5. Moderately likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

This passage is quite suspenseful, as it sets up a dangerous and intense situation where Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The use of descriptive language, such as the sound of the bird crashing into the wall, the darkness of the office, and the brutal actions of CrUsHaK, creates a tense atmosphere. I would rate it as:

6. Very suspenseful
