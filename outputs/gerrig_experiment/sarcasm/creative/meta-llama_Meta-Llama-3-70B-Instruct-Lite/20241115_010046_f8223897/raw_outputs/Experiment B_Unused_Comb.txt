***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a dire situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, and we expect Bond to find a way out of sticky situations. However, the passage doesn't give any clear hints about how Bond might escape, so it's difficult to say how likely it is.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense and dangerous situation for Bond, with a vivid description of the trap set by Le Chiffre. The use of short sentences and active verbs adds to the sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel like they're right there with Bond, experiencing the threat.
