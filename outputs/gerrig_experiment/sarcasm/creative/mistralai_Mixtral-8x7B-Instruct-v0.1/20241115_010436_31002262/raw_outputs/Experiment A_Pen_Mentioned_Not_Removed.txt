 Answer:

Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, Bond has just been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and it does not seem that he has escaped yet. Additionally, there is no information about any immediate plans or possibilities for him to escape. Therefore, based on the information provided in this specific passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. I would choose option 1: "Not very likely."

Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation in which Bond has been captured by his enemy and is in danger. The level of tension and suspense can depend on the individual reader's interpretation, but the situation is objectively suspenseful, with Bond's life and mission hanging in the balance. Therefore, I would choose option 5: "Moderately suspenseful."
