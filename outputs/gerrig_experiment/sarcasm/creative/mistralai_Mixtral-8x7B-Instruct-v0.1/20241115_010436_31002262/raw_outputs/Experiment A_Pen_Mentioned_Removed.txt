 Answer:

Question 1: Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre as the excerpt does not provide enough context regarding their current situation or Bond's resources. However, considering Bond's skills and experiences, one might assume that he has a moderate chance of escaping. So, I would choose option 5: Moderately likely.

Question 2: The suspense level can be subjective depending on the reader's perspective. However, since Bond is in a challenging situation with Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and there is uncertainty about what will happen next, I would say this passage is somewhat suspenseful. Therefore, I would choose option 2: Somewhat suspenseful.
