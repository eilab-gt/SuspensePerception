Based on the modified passage provided, here are my answers:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Given the current situation described in the passage where Bond has been caught off guard, is outnumbered, and has been searched and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his men, Bond's immediate chances of escape appear to be quite low. However, considering that this is a James Bond novel and that Bond is known for his resourcefulness and skill in extricating himself from dangerous situations, it is conceivable that he could find a way out eventually. 

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
The passage builds suspense by revealing that Bond is in a precarious situation, having just been caught by Le Chiffre and his men. The fact that Bond is typically depicted as highly capable and quick-witted makes the reader wonder how he will react and if he will be able to escape. The suspense is further heightened by the action sequence and Bond's attempts to defend himself, despite being overwhelmed. 

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful
