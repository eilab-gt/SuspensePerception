Based on the excerpt provided:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: **4. Neutral or Uncertain**

The passage does not provide enough information to confidently assess the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past by using distractions and his environment to his advantage, but he is now bound and guarded by a large, presumably strong, and violent man named Mr. Crushak. Without further information, it is unclear whether Bond will escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: **6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is filled with tension and suspense, as it describes a dramatic turn of events where Bond, after a momentary victory, is once again captured and put in a precarious situation. The description of Bond's bindings and the introduction of Mr. Crushak, who is explicitly instructed to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak, adds to the uncertainty and danger that Bond faces.
