Question 1: The likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre appears to be Neutral or Uncertain (4), given that he is currently at a disadvantage as a prisoner with his gun confiscated and is about to be searched for any other weapons. However, considering Bond's resourcefulness and his attempt to exchange words with Vesper, it's not impossible that he could find a way to escape.

Question 2: The passage is Extremely suspenseful (7). The narrative involves Bond being caught in a critical situation, trying to communicate with Vesper under duress, and the looming threat of Le Chiffre's plans, which all contribute to a high level of suspense.
