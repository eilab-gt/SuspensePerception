***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the excerpt provided, Bond is in a precarious situation. He has just attempted an escape, which was thwarted by one of Blofeld's henchmen, Mr. Crushak. Bond is now tied up with piano wire, which is causing him considerable pain. Considering this, and the fact that Blofeld and Crushak are still present and armed, it would seem that Bond's chances of escape are not very likely at the moment. However, James Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape seemingly inescapable situations, so there is always a chance. But based on the immediate circumstances, the answer would be:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is very suspenseful. Bond has been captured, and there is a sense of danger and uncertainty about whether he will be able to escape or not. The detail about the piano wire biting into Bond's flesh increases the tension, as it suggests a painful restraint. The presence of armed adversaries and the fact that Bond is in the lair of his enemy add to the suspense.
