Question 1: The likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre based on the excerpt is difficult to gauge definitively, given the turn of events and the control that Le Chiffre has over the situation. Bond has shown resourcefulness by trying to break away and attack his captors, but he is outnumbered and now disarmed. The actions of Le Chiffre's Corsican bodyguard and the fact that they are actively searching Bond for additional weaponry indicate a level of preparedness and control on their part. Considering these factors, the answer would be "Neutral or Uncertain" (4) since the situation could go either way.

Question 2: The passage is "Very suspenseful" (6). The action is intense, with Bond making a desperate attempt to free himself and find Vesper. The physical confrontation with his captors and the disarming of Bond by the Corsican bodyguard add to the tension. Additionally, the anticipation of what Le Chiffre plans to do next, coupled with Bond's uncertain fate, makes for a highly suspenseful narrative.
