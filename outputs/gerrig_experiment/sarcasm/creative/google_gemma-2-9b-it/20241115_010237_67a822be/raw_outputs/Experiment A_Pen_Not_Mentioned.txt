Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

Answer: **2. Somewhat likely**

**Reasoning:**  While Bond is captured and outnumbered, he shows immediate resourcefulness and fighting ability.  He manages to land a blow on one of the gunmen and tries to make a quick escape. This suggests Bond isn't going down without a fight and may have a chance, but the odds are stacked against him. 

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

Answer: **5. Moderately suspenseful**

**Reasoning:**  The passage creates a sense of immediate danger. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre.  The quick movements, the descriptions of the struggle, and the ominous tone contribute to the suspense. However, it's not extremely high tension yet as we don't yet know the full extent of Le Chiffre's plan or Bond's options.
