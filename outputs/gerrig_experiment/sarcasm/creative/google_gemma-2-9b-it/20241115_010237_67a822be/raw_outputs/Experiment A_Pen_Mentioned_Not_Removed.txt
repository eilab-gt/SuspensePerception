Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely** 

While Bond is clearly in a dangerous situation, he has already demonstrated resourcefulness and fighting skills.  His ability to take down one of the gunmen initially suggests he might be able to find a way out. However, Le Chiffre seems to anticipate Bond's moves and is clearly in control.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. We have Bond trapped, outnumbered, and facing a cunning adversary. The short, clipped sentences and the descriptions of Bond's movements create a sense of urgency and danger.  Le Chiffre's calm observation and final line, "Let's not waste time," adds to the anticipation of what is to come.
