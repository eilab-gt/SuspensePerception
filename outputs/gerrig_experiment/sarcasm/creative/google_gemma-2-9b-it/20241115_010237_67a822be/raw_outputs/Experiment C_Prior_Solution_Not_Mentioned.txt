Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and in a difficult situation, he's shown resourcefulness and cunning in the past. The description of him taking advantage of the distraction to pull up the rug suggests he's not giving up easily.  

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage creates a tense atmosphere. We have Bond trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Blofeld's threat. The detailed descriptions of the struggle and Bond's capture, along with Blofeld's menacing words and the introduction of the ugly and imposing Crusher, heighten the suspense.
