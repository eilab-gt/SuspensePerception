Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

**3. Slightly likely**

While Bond is currently bound and in a precarious situation, he's James Bond. He's known for his cunning, resourcefulness, and ability to improvise. The fact that he managed to momentarily gain an advantage by using the bird distraction suggests he won't give up easily.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**


**6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is written in a way that heightens tension. 

* **Action and Threat:** The sudden bird distraction, Bond's struggle, the appearance of Crusher, and the threat of elimination create a sense of danger and urgency.
* **Power Imbalance:** Blofeld's calm, controlled demeanor and the description of Crusher as "very large and very ugly" emphasizes the power imbalance and Bond's vulnerability.
* **Uncertain Future:** The passage ends with Bond tied up and left alone with Crusher, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next and increasing the suspense.
