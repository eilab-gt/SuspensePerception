Here are my answers based on the provided passage:

**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

 **3. Slightly likely**

While Bond is in a precarious situation,  he has a history of escaping tight spots. His quick thinking in using the distraction of the bird shows he's not giving up easily.  However, the presence of Crushak, a seemingly dedicated and brutal guard, makes a successful escape less probable.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**


 **6. Very suspenseful**

The passage builds suspense through several elements:

* **The trapped situation:** Bond and Vesper are prisoners in a dangerous situation.
* **Blofeld's control:** Blofeld's calculated and threatening demeanor increases tension.
* **The introduction of Crushak:** The description of Crushak as "very large and very ugly" and his "devoted" nature to eliminating irritations adds a palpable sense of danger.
* **The threat of violence:** The clear warning that Crushak is ordered to shoot Bond if he speaks adds an element of immediate danger and urgency. 


The combination of these factors
