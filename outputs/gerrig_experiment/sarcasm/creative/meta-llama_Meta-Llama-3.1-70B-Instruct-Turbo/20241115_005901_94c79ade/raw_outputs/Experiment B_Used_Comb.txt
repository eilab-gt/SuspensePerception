***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Considering the context of the situation, with Bond being caught off guard, disarmed, and outnumbered, I would say that the likelihood of his escape is relatively low at this point. However, James Bond is a skilled agent, and his ability to think on his feet and react to unexpected situations is a hallmark of his character. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of his escape as follows:
