 ***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine how likely it is that Bond will escape from Blofeld. However, given that Bond is bound and being held captive, it can be inferred that his situation is precarious.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful, as it describes a high-stakes situation in which Bond is captured by Blofeld and his henchmen. The tension is further heightened by the fact that Bond is bound and at the mercy of his captors, with no clear means of escape in sight. Additionally, the unusual format of the passage, with words alternating between upper and lower case, adds to the overall sense of unease and uncertainty.
