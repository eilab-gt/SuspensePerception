***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped, surrounded by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and is being held captive. Blofeld seems to be gloating and has taken measures to ensure Bond's cooperation, making escape appear unlikely at this point.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is intense and dramatic, with a sense of foreboding and danger. The description of the setting, the characters' actions, and the tension between Bond and Blofeld create a sense of unease and anticipation, making it extremely suspenseful. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to thwart Blofeld's plans.
