Answering Question 1: 
Considering that Bond has already been captured by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, the chances of Bond escaping appear to be low. They have the upper hand, and Le Chiffre seems to have a plan in place. It's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape from this situation without some kind of external intervention or a clever plan. I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

Answering Question 2: 
This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of danger and tension for Bond. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, especially after Bond's failed attempt to escape and being caught by Le Chiffre's men. The text also leaves the reader with a sense of uncertainty and unease, as Bond is at the mercy of his captors. I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

6. Very suspenseful
