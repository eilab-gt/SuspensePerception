Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

It seems that Bond is in a precarious situation, with no clear means of escape and being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen. The fact that they are being held at gunpoint, and Cruschak is using wire to restrain Bond, suggests that escape is highly unlikely at this point.

Answer to Question 2:
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful. The use of dark and ominous descriptions, such as the large man's face contorted into a smile, and the constant threat of violence, creates a sense of tension and fear. The fact that Bond is trapped and helpless, with no clear way to escape, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The passage expertly builds tension, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing his fear and helplessness.
