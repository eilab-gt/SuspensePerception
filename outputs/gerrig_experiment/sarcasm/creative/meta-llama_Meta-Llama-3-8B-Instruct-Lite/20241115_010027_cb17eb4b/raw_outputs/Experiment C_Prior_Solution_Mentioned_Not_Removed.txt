Answer 1: I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 1. Not very likely. Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and it seems like a challenging situation for Bond to escape from.

Answer 2: I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The situation is dire for Bond, and the use of suspenseful language, such as "cracked into the wall of glass", "knocking out the large light that had illuminated the room", and "each subsequent twist of the wire biting more painfully into Bond's flesh" creates a sense of tension and fear for the reader. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape or if he will be trapped forever.
