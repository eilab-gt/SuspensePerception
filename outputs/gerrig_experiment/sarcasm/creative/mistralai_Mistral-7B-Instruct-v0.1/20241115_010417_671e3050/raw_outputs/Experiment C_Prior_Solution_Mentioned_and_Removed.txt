 It is difficult to say for certain, but it seems likely that Bond will try to escape from Blofeld. Based on the passage, it appears that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held in his office. It is not clear what Blofeld's ultimate intentions are for Bond and Vesper, but it is possible that he will attempt to eliminate them. It is also possible that Bond and Vesper will try to find a way to escape before it is too late.

As for how suspenseful this passage is, it is difficult to say. The passage does contain some tense moments, such as when Bond fires back at one of Blofeld's guards and when Crushak pins Bond in his chair. However, it is also a bit of a repetition of Bond being captured and imprisoned, which can make the passage less suspenseful. Overall, I would say that this passage is moderately suspenseful.
