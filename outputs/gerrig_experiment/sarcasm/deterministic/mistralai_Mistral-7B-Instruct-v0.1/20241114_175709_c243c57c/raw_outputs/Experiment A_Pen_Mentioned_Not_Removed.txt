 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has successfully captured Bond and Vesper, and has two gunmen at his disposal. Bond has been shot and is lying on the ground, and it is unclear how he will be able to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there is no immediate danger to Bond or Vesper, the fact that they are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen creates a sense of tension and uncertainty about their fate. The passage also hints at the danger that Bond is in, as he has been shot and is lying on the ground. Overall, the passage is suspenseful, but not extremely so.
