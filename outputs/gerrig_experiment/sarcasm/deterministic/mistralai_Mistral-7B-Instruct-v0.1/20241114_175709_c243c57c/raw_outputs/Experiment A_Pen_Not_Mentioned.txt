 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has successfully captured Bond and Vesper, and has them at his mercy. He has also set up a trap for Bond, which involves losing a considerable amount of money gambling. While Bond may have some skills and resources at his disposal, it is unclear how he will be able to overcome Le Chiffre's plan and escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there are some tense moments, such as when Bond is shot and when he is being searched for, there are also moments of levity and humor, such as when Bond rolls around in the dirt and when Le Chiffre says "Come my dear friend. Let's not waste time." Overall, the passage has a mix of suspense and tension, but it is not extremely suspenseful.
