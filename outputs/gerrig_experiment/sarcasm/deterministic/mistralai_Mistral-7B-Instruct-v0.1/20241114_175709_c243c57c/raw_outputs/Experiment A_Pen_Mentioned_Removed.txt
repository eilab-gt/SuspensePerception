 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Based on the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has successfully captured Bond and Vesper, and has two gunmen at his disposal. Bond has been shot and is injured, and his foot is trapped in a shoe. It seems that Le Chiffre has the upper hand in this situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. There are several tense moments, such as when Bond is shot and when Le Chiffre snatches him away. However, the passage also includes some humor and lighthearted moments, which can lessen the overall suspense. Overall, the passage is a good balance of suspense and tension.
