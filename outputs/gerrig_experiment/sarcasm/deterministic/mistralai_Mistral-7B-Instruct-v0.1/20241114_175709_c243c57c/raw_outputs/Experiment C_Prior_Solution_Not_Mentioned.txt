 Answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Based on the passage, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld. Blofeld has successfully captured Bond and Vesper and has them as prisoners in his office. Blofeld has also laid a trap for Bond by having a large bird crash into the wall of his office, which allowed him to shoot at Bond with a gun. Additionally, Blofeld has a large and ugly man guarding the door, who is not amused by Bond's antics.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

The passage is moderately suspenseful. While there are no major plot twists or surprises, the fact that Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Blofeld and have been captured in a trap adds a sense of danger and uncertainty to the situation. The large and ugly man guarding the door also adds to the tension. However, the passage is not extremely suspenseful as there are no major cliffhangers or plot twists.
