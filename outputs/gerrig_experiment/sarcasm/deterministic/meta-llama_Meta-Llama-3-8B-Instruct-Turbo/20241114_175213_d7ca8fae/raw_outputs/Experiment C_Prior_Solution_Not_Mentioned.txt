Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and they are being held captive in Blofeld's office. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answer 2: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen, and the description of the scene is vivid and intense. The use of words like "crashed", "stumbled", "knocked out", and "pained" creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes for Bond's escape. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and how Bond will manage to escape from his captors.
