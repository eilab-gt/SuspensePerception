Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond is trapped, and Le Chiffre has the upper hand. Bond's attempt to escape was unsuccessful, and he is now at the mercy of his captors. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will escape without some kind of help or clever plan.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The sudden and unexpected twist of Bond being caught off guard, and the brutal treatment he receives at the hands of Le Chiffre's henchmen, creates a sense of urgency and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next, and the suspense is palpable.
