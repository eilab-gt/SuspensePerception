 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the passage ends with Bond being tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. However, given that this is a James Bond novel and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from dangerous situations, it is reasonable to assume that there is a moderate to high likelihood that Bond will eventually escape from Blofeld's clutches. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as 5. Moderately likely.

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, I would rate it as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage describes a tense and dangerous situation in which Bond and Vesper are captured by Blofeld and his gunmen. The use of capitalized letters to indicate the characters' speech adds to the sense of urgency and danger, while the description of Crushak's brutal treatment of Bond creates a sense of unease and anticipation for what might happen next. Overall, the passage effectively builds suspense and leaves the reader eager to find out what will happen to Bond and Vesper.
