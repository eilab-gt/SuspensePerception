 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, considering that Bond is currently unarmed and trapped, it can be inferred that the likelihood of his escape is low. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood as "Not very likely" (1).

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it is quite high. The sudden bursting in of Le Chiffre and his gunmen, the physical confrontation, and the fact that Bond is now unarmed and trapped all contribute to a sense of tension and uncertainty. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness as "Very suspenseful" (6).
