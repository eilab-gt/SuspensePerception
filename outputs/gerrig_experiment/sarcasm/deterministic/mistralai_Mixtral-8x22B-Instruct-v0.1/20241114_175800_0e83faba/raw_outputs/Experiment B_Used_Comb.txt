 1. For Question 1, "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?" I would rate it as 5. Moderately likely. Although Bond is currently trapped and unarmed, it is a common trope in James Bond stories for him to escape from seemingly impossible situations.

2. For Question 2, "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?" I would rate it as 6. Very suspenseful. The passage describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events, with Bond being ambushed and captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The description of Bond's futile attempt to fight back and his subsequent search for weapons adds to the tension and suspense.
