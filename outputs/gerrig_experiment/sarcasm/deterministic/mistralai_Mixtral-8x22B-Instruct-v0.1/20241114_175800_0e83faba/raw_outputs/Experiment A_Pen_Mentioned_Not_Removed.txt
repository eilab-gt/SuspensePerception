 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre. However, given that Bond has already attempted to fight back and has been captured, it can be inferred that his chances of escape are currently low. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "Not very likely" (1).

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, it is quite high. The passage describes a tense situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. Bond attempts to fight back but is quickly subdued, and the passage ends with Le Chiffre stating that they should not waste time. This creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage "Very suspenseful" (6).
