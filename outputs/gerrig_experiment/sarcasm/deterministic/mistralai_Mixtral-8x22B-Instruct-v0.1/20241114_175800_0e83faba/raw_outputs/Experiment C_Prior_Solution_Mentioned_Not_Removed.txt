 Based on the provided passage, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as the passage ends with Bond being tied up by Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. However, considering Bond's previous ability to outwit Blofeld's guards, it is possible that he may find a way to escape. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "Moderately likely" (5).

As for the suspensefulness of the passage, I would rate it as "Very suspenseful" (6). The passage describes a tense situation where Bond is captured by Blofeld and his henchmen, and there is a sense of danger and uncertainty as Bond is tied up and at the mercy of his captors. The use of capitalized letters and distorted spelling also adds to the sense of chaos and urgency in the scene.
