Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain**

While Bond shows quick thinking and tries to escape, the situation seems dire. He's outnumbered, tied up, and Blofeld is clearly determined to eliminate him this time.  

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

The passage is full of tension. Bond's attempt to escape, the sudden crash, the darkness, the introduction of the menacing Crusher, and Blofeld's chilling words all contribute to a highly suspenseful atmosphere.
