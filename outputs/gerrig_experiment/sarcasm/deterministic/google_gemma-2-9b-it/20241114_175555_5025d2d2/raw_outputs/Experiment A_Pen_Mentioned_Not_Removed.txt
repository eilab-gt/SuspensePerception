Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is in a precarious situation, he's shown to be resourceful and quick-thinking. His initial attempt to escape, though thwarted, demonstrates his willingness to fight back.  Fleming's writing often sets up seemingly hopeless situations for Bond, only for him to find a way out.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage is packed with tension. Bond is trapped, outnumbered, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. The short, choppy sentences and the emphasis on physical actions ("Hurled himself," "slammed himself," "caught Bond's shoe") create a sense of urgency and danger. The final line, "Let's not waste time,"  leaves the reader on a cliffhanger, eager to know what Le Chiffre has in store for Bond.
