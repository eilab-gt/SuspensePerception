Here are my answers based on the provided excerpt:

**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**

**Answer: 5. Moderately likely**

**Reasoning:** While Bond is currently captured and in a vulnerable position, he's shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past.  The distraction with the bird and his attempt to escape demonstrate his willingness to act.  However, Blofeld seems to be in control, and the introduction of the menacing Mr. Crusher adds a significant obstacle.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**

**Answer: 6. Very suspenseful**

**Reasoning:** The passage builds tension effectively. Bond's capture, Blofeld's menacing tone, the introduction of the large and ugly Mr. Crusher, and the description of Bond being tied up all contribute to a sense of impending danger and uncertainty about Bond's fate.
