***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond has managed to evade the two gunmen and has even caused some damage to them. However, Le Chiffre and his assistant are still in control, and Bond is being led away. Considering the situation, I would say that Bond's chances of escape are not very high at this point, as he is outnumbered and outgunned. Therefore, the answer is:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is full of action, tension, and uncertainty, which are all key elements of suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next, and the use of phrases like "He very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand" and "He twisted it sharply" creates a sense of urgency and danger. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being led away by Le Chiffre and his assistant, and the mention of the two gunmen dragging Bond to his feet, adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would say that this passage is:

6. Very suspenseful
