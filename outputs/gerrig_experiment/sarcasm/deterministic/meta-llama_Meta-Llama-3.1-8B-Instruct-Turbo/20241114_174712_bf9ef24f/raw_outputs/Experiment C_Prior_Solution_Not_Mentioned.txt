Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond is being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by wire wrapped around his arms. This suggests that he is in a difficult and precarious situation, making it unlikely that he will escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive and restrained by wire. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as "a very large and ugly man", "the large light that had illuminated the room", and "the dark of the office", adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The fact that Bond is being held by a villainous character who is not amused by his behavior also adds to the tension, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
