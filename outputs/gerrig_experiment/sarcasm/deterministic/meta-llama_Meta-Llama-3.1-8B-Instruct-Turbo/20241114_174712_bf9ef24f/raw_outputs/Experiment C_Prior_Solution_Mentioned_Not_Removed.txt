***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He is being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by wire. The fact that Blofeld is gloating and taunting Bond suggests that he has the upper hand. Therefore, I would say that it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Blofeld.

Answer: 1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is being held captive and restrained. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "A large bird crashed into the wall of glass that made up one side of Blofeld's large office" and "Each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being held captive and is in a vulnerable position also adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would say that this passage is extremely suspenseful.

Answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful
