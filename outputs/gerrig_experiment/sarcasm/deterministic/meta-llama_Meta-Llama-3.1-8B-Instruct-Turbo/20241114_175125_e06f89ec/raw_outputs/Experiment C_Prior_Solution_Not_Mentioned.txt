Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a difficult situation, being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, with one of them, Crustak, pinning him down with piano wire. This makes it seem unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tension and suspense, with Bond being trapped and helpless, and the threat of violence and pain from the piano wire. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "A large bird crashed into the wall of glass that made up one side of Blofeld's large office" and "Each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" creates a sense of unease and tension, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
