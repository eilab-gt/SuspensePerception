Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond is being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by wire. This situation does not seem favorable for an escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense and potentially deadly situation for Bond. He is being held captive by a villainous character, and the use of a large and ugly man, Crusshak, to restrain him adds to the sense of danger and unease. The passage also creates a sense of foreboding, as Blofeld seems to be enjoying Bond's predicament and is making ominous comments about his past experiences with Bond.
