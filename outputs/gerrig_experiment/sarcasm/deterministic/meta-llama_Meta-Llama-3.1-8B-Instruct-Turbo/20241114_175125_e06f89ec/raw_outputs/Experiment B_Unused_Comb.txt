***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is in a difficult situation. He has been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they are searching him. Le Chiffre is also taking his belongings, including his pocket comb. This suggests that Bond is not in a position to escape easily. Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as:

1. Not very likely

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
This passage is full of action and tension, with Bond being caught and searched by Le Chiffre's men. The use of words like "burst in", "guns drawn", "whirled around", and "crashed to the ground" creates a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is being handled roughly and his belongings are being taken away adds to the suspense. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as:

7. Extremely suspenseful
