***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is in a precarious situation, being a prisoner of Blofeld and his gunmen, Bond is a skilled and resourceful agent who has managed to outsmart Blofeld before. It's likely that he will try to find a way to escape, and his skills and experience make it moderately likely that he will succeed.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchmen. The description of the scene, including the sudden crash of the bird into the glass wall and the dramatic lighting, adds to the sense of drama and suspense. The threat of violence and death hangs over Bond, making the reader feel anxious and invested in his fate.
