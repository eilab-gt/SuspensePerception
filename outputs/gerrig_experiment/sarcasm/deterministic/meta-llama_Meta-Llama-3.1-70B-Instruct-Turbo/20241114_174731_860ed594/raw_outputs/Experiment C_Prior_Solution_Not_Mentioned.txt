***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage shows Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's men, it is a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations. The passage does not provide any information that would suggest Bond's escape is impossible, and it is likely that Bond will find a way to escape and turn the tables on Blofeld.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful as it shows Bond being captured and at the mercy of Blofeld and his men. The use of vivid descriptions of the scene, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the darkness of the office, creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The fact that Bond is being tied up and threatened by Blofeld and his men adds to the suspense, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next.
