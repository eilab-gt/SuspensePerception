***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't give a clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past, he is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The outcome is uncertain, and it's difficult to predict whether Bond will be able to escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful, as it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is being held captive and searched for weapons. The use of words like "suddenly", "whistle of pain", "hurled himself", and "roughly stripped" creates a sense of urgency and violence, making the reader feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing the danger and uncertainty. The fact that Bond is trying to come up with a plan to escape adds to the suspense, as the reader is left wondering if he will be successful or not.
