***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond is currently trapped and unarmed, but given his resourcefulness and past history of escaping dangerous situations, it is neither certain that he will escape nor that he will not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is filled with action and tension, as Bond is suddenly attacked and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his men. The uncertainty of Bond's situation and the immediate danger he is in contribute to a high level of suspense.
