***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape. Bond has been tied up with piano wire by Crushak, and Blofeld has left him to contemplate his behavior. There is no indication of an immediate plan for escape, nor is there any information about the security or layout of the location that would suggest the ease or difficulty of an escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

Answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful due to the high stakes involved. Bond has been captured and is now at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. The use of piano wire to tie Bond up suggests a level of cruelty and danger, and the fact that Bond is left alone with Crushak implies potential violence. The uncertainty of Bond's fate and the tension created by his precarious situation contribute to the overall suspense of the passage.
