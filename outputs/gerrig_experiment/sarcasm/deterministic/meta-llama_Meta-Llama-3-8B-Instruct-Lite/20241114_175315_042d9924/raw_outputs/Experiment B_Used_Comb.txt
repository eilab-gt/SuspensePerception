Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Bond has been caught and pinned down. This implies that Bond's escape is unlikely at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation, and the use of words like "trapped", "pinned down", and "puny and impotent" creates a sense of hopelessness. The description of the three men approaching Bond, the use of the word "search" and the fact that Bond is being pinned down and helpless all contribute to a sense of suspense and danger.
