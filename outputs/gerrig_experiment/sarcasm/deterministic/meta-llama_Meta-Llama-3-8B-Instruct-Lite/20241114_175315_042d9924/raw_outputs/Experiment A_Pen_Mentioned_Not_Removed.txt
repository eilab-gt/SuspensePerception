Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and it's unlikely that he will escape easily.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "Le Chiffre's eyes gleamed with a cold, cruel light" and "the Corsican slammed his gun into Bond's shoulder", adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape.
