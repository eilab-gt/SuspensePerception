Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond and Vesper are now the prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, which makes it unlikely that Bond will escape on his own. The fact that Le Chiffre has laid a successful trap for Bond and has the upper hand also makes it difficult for Bond to escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond and Vesper are trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre, which creates a sense of unease. The use of descriptive language, such as "the Corisan slammed him back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond's foot whispered past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow deliberately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond's shoe at the top of it, and twisted it sharply" adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and Vesper next, which keeps them engaged and invested in the story.
