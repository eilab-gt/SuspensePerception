Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Cruskak and the large, ugly man. He is being held captive and is in a vulnerable position, making it unlikely that he will escape from Blofeld.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid and ominous descriptions, such as the large, ugly man and the sound of the gun being cocked, adds to the suspense. The reader is on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what will happen to Bond and Vesper.
