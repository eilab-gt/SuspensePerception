 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a difficult and precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. However, given Bond's history as a skilled and resourceful agent, it is possible that he may still find a way to escape. Therefore, I would answer this question with "Somewhat likely" (2).

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a sudden and unexpected turn of events, in which Bond is attacked and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men.
