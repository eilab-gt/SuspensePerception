 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that Bond is currently in a challenging situation, being tied up and under the watch of Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. However, it is important to remember that Bond is a skilled and experienced secret agent, so it is possible that he may find a way to escape. That being said, based on the information given, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping as "somewhat likely," given that there is still uncertainty about what will happen next.

Answer Question 2: The passage describes a tense and high-stakes situation, with Bond being held captive by a dangerous criminal and facing an uncertain future. The level of suspense in the passage is heightened by the use of descriptive language and the sense of danger that is conveyed. Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as "very suspenseful."
