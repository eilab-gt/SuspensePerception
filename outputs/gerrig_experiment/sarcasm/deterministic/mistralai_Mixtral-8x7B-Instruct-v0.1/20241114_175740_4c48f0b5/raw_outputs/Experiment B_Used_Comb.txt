 Answer Question 1: Based on the information provided in the excerpt, Bond is currently trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre. There is no information given about how Bond will escape or if he has the ability to do so. Therefore, it is uncertain how likely it is that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre. I would choose option 4, "Neutral or Uncertain".

Answer Question 2: The excerpt describes a scene in which Bond, who has just defeated his opponent in a high-stakes game, is suddenly attacked and overpowered by Le Chiffre and his men. This creates a sense of suspense as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and how he will escape from this dangerous situation. Therefore, I would choose option 5, "Moderately suspenseful".
