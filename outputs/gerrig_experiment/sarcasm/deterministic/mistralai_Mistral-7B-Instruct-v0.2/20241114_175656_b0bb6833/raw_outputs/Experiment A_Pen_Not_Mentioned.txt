 Answer Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Answer Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage describes Bond and Vesper being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of descriptive language and the imminent danger to Bond's life creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, making it a very suspenseful passage. Additionally, the fact that Bond's plan to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and exchange a few words with the girl before escaping has been thwarted adds to the suspense.
