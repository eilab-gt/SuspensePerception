Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his captors without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and action, with Bond making a sudden decision to follow Vesper, and then being caught and disarmed by the Corsican. The use of vivid language, such as "Like lightning" and "very quickly, but somehow delicately", adds to the sense of urgency and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way to turn the tables on his captors.
