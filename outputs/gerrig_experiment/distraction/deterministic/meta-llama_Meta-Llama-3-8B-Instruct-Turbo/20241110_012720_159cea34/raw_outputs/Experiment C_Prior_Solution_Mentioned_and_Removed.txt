Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, and he is being restrained by piano wire. The situation seems dire, and it's unclear how Bond will be able to escape from his predicament.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and helpless against Blofeld's henchmen. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkening of the room, and the appearance of the large and ugly man all contribute to a sense of escalating suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or survive the ordeal.
