Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond is trapped, and he's been disarmed and searched. He's also been patted down and his comb has been taken away, leaving him feeling "puny and impotent". It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from Le Chiffre and his gunmen in his current situation.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage is full of tension and surprise, with Bond's confidence and sense of security being quickly turned upside down. The sudden burst of the door, the guns drawn, and Bond's failed attempt to escape all contribute to a sense of high stakes and danger. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will be in serious trouble.
