Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a chair and has no clear means of escape. The situation seems dire, and it's unlikely that Bond will be able to escape without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and helpless against Blofeld's superior numbers and resources. The sudden interruption by the bird, the darkness, and the appearance of Crushak all contribute to a sense of urgency and danger. The description of Bond's predicament, including the painful wire wrapping around his arms, adds to the sense of suspense and foreboding. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to create a sense of tension and suspense.
