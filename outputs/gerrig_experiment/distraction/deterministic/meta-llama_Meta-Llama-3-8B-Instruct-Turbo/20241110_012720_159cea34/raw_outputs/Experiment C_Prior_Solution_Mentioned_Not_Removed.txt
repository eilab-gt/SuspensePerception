Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. He is tied up in a wooden armchair with piano wire, which makes it difficult for him to escape. Additionally, Blofeld has mentioned that Crushak is devoted to eliminating irritations from his life, which suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and helpless against Blofeld and his henchmen. The sudden appearance of the bird, the chaos that ensues, and the revelation that Bond is now a prisoner all contribute to a sense of high stakes and urgency. The vivid descriptions of the characters and the setting also add to the suspense, making it feel like the reader is right there with Bond, experiencing the danger and uncertainty firsthand.
