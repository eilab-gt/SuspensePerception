Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and he has been disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape from his captors without some kind of plan or assistance.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond and Vesper being taken prisoner and Bond's attempts to escape being thwarted. The use of vivid language and the sense of danger and uncertainty create a sense of suspense that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
