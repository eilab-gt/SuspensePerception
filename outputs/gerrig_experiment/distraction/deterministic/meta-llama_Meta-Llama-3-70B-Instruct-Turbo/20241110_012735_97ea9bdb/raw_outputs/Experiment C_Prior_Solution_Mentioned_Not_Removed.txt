***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his cunning and ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense from the start, with Bond being held at gunpoint and then attempting to escape. The sudden interruption by the bird crashing into the wall adds to the surprise and unpredictability, and the subsequent confrontation with Crushak and Blofeld raises the stakes. The description of Bond being tied up with piano wire and the ominous tone of Blofeld's dialogue all contribute to a very suspenseful atmosphere.
