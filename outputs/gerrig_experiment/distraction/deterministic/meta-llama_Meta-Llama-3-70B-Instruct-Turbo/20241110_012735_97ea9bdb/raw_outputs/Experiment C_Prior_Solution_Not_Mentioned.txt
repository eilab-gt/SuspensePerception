***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and tied up, this is a James Bond novel, and it's unlikely that the protagonist will remain captive for long. Bond has already shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall, and it's likely that he will find another way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the tension and creates a sense of urgency. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape and what will happen to him next.
