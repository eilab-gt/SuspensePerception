I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has managed to cause some chaos and distraction, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. However, Bond's past experiences and skills suggest that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape from this precarious situation.
