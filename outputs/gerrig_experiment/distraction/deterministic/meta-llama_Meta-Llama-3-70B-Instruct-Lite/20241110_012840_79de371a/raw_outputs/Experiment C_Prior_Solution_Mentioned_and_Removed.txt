I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 3: Slightly likely. Although Bond has managed to cause some chaos and distraction, he is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak. However, Bond's past escapades and resourcefulness suggest that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of his enemies. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the painful wire binding Bond's arms, adds to the sense of urgency and suspense. The threat of Crushak shooting Bond if he even attempts to speak also raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
