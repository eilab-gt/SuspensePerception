I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide a clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond has been caught and tied up, he is a skilled agent, and it's possible he might find a way to escape. However, the situation seems dire, and it's also possible that Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, will prevent Bond from escaping.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being caught and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as "piano wire bit more painfully into Bond's flesh," adds to the sense of unease and suspense. The fact that Bond is at the mercy of Blofeld and Crushak creates a sense of uncertainty, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
