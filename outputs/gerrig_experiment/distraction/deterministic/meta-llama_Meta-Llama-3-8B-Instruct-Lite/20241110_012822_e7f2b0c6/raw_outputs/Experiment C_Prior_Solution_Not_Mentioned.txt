Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and is being held captive in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and the chair's corners. This makes it unlikely that he will escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and helpless, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the "painfully" tight piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia, as Bond is trapped in a small, dark room with no clear escape route. Overall, the passage is very suspenseful and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
