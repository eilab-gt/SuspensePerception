Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and is being held captive in a chair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and legs. This makes it unlikely that he will escape from his current situation.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes and intense situation where Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The use of vivid and ominous language, such as "large and very ugly man", "contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile", and "bit more painfully into Bond's flesh" creates a sense of tension and foreboding. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or not.
