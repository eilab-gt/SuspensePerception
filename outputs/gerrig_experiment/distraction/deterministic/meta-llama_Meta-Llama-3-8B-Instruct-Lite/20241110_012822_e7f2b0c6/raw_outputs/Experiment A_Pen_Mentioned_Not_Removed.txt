Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being held captive by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and has been disarmed. It seems unlikely that he will escape from this situation without some kind of clever plan or intervention.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is being held captive by a villainous character. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashed to the ground", and "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the reader feel on edge and eager to know what will happen next. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty, as the reader is left wondering how Bond will escape from this predicament.
