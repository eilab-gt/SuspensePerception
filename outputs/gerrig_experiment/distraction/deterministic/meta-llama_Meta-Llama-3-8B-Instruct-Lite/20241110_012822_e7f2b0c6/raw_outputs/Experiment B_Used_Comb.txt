Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen, making it unlikely that he will escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is suddenly attacked and overpowered by Le Chiffre's henchmen. The use of action-packed language, such as "the door burst in toward him", "leapt through", "guns drawn", and "crashed to the ground" adds to the suspense. The passage also creates a sense of vulnerability and helplessness as Bond is searched and disarmed, making the reader feel a sense of unease and tension.
