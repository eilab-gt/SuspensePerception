***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, the passage shows Bond's quick thinking and resourcefulness in trying to escape, even in the face of adversity. This suggests that Bond is likely to find a way to escape, given his skills and experience.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tense moments, from the bird crashing into the glass wall to Bond's failed attempt to escape and his subsequent capture. The description of the henchman, Mr. Crushak, and the painful way he ties Bond up with piano wire adds to the sense of danger and suspense. The passage effectively creates a sense of urgency and raises questions about how Bond will manage to escape, making it extremely suspenseful.
