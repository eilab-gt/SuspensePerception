***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, Bond's actions in the passage suggest that he is resourceful and skilled. He attempts to escape and cause damage to the gunmen, and even after being caught, he is able to right himself with minimal damage. This implies that Bond is a capable and determined individual who will likely find a way to escape from his captors.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and urgency. Bond is in a precarious situation, and the reader is left wondering if he will be able to escape. The use of action-packed language, such as "hurled himself down the passage" and "slammed himself back against the wall", creates a sense of intensity and raises the stakes. Additionally, the fact that Bond is being searched and disarmed by the gunmen adds to the sense of danger and vulnerability, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
