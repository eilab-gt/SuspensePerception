***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as 6. Very likely. This is because James Bond is a skilled and resourceful character, and despite being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, it is likely that he will find a way to escape. The fact that he was able to outwit Blofeld's guard in a previous encounter also suggests that he has the skills and cunning to escape from this situation.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being held captive and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the large bird crashing into the wall of glass and the ugly face of Mr. Crushak, adds to the sense of drama and suspense. The fact that Bond is being tied up with piano wire and is in a precarious situation also creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
