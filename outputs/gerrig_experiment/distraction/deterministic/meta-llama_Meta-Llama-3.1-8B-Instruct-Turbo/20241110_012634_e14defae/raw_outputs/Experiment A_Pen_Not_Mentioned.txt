**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been caught off guard by Le Chiffre's trap and is now a prisoner. He has been disarmed and is being handled roughly by the two gunmen. Although Bond is agile and has managed to roll to his feet, the situation seems to be under control of Le Chiffre and his men, making it unlikely that Bond will escape easily.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is in a precarious situation, having been caught off guard and disarmed. The use of words like "suddenly", "like lightning", and "agilely" creates a sense of quick and intense action, which adds to the suspense. The fact that Bond is being handled roughly and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere.
