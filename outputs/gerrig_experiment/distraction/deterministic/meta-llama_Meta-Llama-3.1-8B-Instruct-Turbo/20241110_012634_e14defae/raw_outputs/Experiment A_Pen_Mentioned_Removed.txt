**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been caught off guard by Le Chiffre's trap and is now a prisoner. He has been disarmed and is being handled roughly by the two gunmen. Although Bond is able to think quickly and move agilely, the situation seems to be under control of Le Chiffre and his men. Therefore, it is not very likely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond is caught off guard and is being handled by his captors. The use of action verbs like "slammed", "shot", "twisted", "dragged", and "snatched" creates a sense of urgency and tension. The fact that Bond is able to think quickly and move agilely adds to the suspense, as it suggests that he may still have a chance to escape or turn the situation around. The passage also raises questions about what will happen next, such as whether Bond will be able to escape or what Le Chiffre's ultimate plan is, which adds to the suspense.
