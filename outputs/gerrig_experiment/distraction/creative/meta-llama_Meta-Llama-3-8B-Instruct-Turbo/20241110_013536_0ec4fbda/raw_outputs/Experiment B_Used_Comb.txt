Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"

I would answer: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently trapped and disarmed, and he is being handled roughly by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape in the immediate future.

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it sets up a situation where the protagonist, Bond, is suddenly and unexpectedly attacked and trapped. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and overcome his captors. The use of vivid and descriptive language, such as "the door burst in toward him", "guns drawn", and "Bond felt puny and impotent", adds to the sense of tension and suspense.
