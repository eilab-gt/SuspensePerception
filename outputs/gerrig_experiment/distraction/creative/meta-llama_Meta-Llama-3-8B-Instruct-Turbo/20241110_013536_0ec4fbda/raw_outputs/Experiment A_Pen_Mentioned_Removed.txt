Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond and Vesper are now prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have been disarmed. Le Chiffre's attention is focused on Bond, and his men are keeping him under close surveillance. The situation is dire, and Bond's chances of escape seem slim at this point.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a tense and precarious situation where Bond and Vesper are trapped and disarmed. The use of descriptive language, such as "like lightning" and "very quickly, but somehow delicately", adds to the sense of urgency and tension. The reader is left wondering how Bond will manage to escape and what will happen to Vesper.
