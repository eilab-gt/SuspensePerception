Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped in a wooden armchair with piano wire wrapped around his arms and legs, making it difficult for him to move or escape. Additionally, he is surrounded by Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, who are both determined to keep him captive.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the graphic detail of the piano wire cutting into Bond's flesh, adds to the sense of suspense and danger. The passage also builds tension by describing Bond's attempts to escape and the obstacles he faces, making it a thrilling and suspenseful read.
