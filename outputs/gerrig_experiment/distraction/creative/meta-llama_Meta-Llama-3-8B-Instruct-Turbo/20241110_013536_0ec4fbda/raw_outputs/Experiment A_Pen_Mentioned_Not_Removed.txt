Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is outnumbered and outgunned, and he has just been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen. He has no clear plan to escape, and his attempt to kick the thin man and pursue Vesper was foiled by the Corsican's quick thinking. It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre's clutches at this point.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is caught by Le Chiffre and his men. The sudden twist of the Corsican's hand to twist Bond's shoe and send him crashing to the ground is unexpected and adds to the suspense. The fact that Bond is being stripped of his weapons and is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men makes the reader feel like anything can happen next, which increases the suspense.
