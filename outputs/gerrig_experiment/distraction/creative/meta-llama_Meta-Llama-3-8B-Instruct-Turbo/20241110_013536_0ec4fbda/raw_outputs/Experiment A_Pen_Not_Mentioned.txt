Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
1. Not very likely

Bond is already a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and they have disarmed him and are treating him roughly. It seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without some kind of plan or outside help.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it sets up a situation where Bond is trapped and in danger. The use of descriptive language, such as "like lightning" and "he very quickly, but somehow delicately", creates a sense of tension and urgency. The fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned, and that Le Chiffre seems to have the upper hand, adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or find a way out of his predicament.
