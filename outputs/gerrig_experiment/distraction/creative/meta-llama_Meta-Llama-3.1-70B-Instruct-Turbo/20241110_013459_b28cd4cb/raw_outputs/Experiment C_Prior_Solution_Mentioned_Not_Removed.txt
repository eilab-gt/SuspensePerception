**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**
I would choose option 6: Very likely. The passage suggests that Bond has been able to think quickly and take advantage of distractions in the past (as evidenced by the bird crashing into the wall), and he has a history of outwitting Blofeld's guards. Additionally, Bond's character is typically portrayed as resourceful and skilled, which increases the likelihood of his escape.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tense moments, such as the bird crashing into the wall, the darkness after the light is knocked out, and Bond being pinned into a chair with piano wire. The presence of Blofeld and his menacing henchman, Mr. Crushak, adds to the sense of danger and tension, and the fact that Bond is being held captive and tortured raises the stakes. The passage effectively builds suspense and creates a sense of urgency, making it extremely suspenseful.
