**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**

Based on the passage, I would say that the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld is: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. While Bond has shown resourcefulness and quick thinking in the past, the situation seems dire, with Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak. However, the passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Bond's escape, and it's likely that Bond will find a way to escape, given his character's history.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being captured and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The fact that Crushak has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him adds to the sense of urgency and raises the stakes. The passage also sets up a sense of anticipation, as the reader wonders how Bond will manage to escape from this situation.
