***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose option 5, Moderately likely.

Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld's henchman, Crushak, Bond has already shown his resourcefulness and cunning in the passage. He took advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the glass wall and attempted to escape. While he was thwarted by Crushak, it's likely that Bond will continue to try and find a way to escape, given his character's history of being able to think on his feet and find creative solutions to difficult situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6, Very suspenseful.

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense from the beginning, with Blofeld's ominous tone and the introduction of Crushak, a menacing and ugly henchman. The bird crashing into the glass wall adds an element of surprise and chaos, and Bond's subsequent attempt to escape keeps the reader on edge. The passage then builds up to a more ominous and sinister tone
