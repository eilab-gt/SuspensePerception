Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

Bond is currently trapped and being searched by Le Chiffre's gunmen, and Le Chiffre has successfully taken away his gun and other potential weapons. This does not bode well for Bond's chances of escape.

Answer to Question 2:
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it suddenly introduces a dramatic turn of events, where Bond's moment of triumph is quickly turned into a situation where he is overpowered and trapped. The use of action-packed language, such as "busted in", "guns drawn", "crashed to the ground", and "twisted it sharply", creates a sense of tension and urgency, making the reader feel like they are experiencing the scene alongside Bond. The fact that Bond is now at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his henchmen adds to the suspense, making it clear that Bond is in a precarious situation.
