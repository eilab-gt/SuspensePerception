Answer 1: I would choose option 1, "Not very likely". The passage suggests that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his henchmen, and is being searched and disarmed. This implies that Bond's chances of escape are low at this point.

Answer 2: I would choose option 6, "Very suspenseful". The passage is full of action and tension, with Bond fighting off henchmen and trying to outmaneuver his captors. The use of words like "suddenly", "lightning", and "agilely" adds to the sense of urgency and excitement, making the passage very suspenseful. The fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned also raises the stakes, making the reader worry about his fate.
