Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, with Bond being pinned down by piano wire. This situation seems dire and unlikely to be resolved by Bond's escape alone.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and helpless, and Blofeld and Crushak being formidable foes. The descriptions of the setting, the characters' actions, and the emotions evoked (e.g., fear, pain) all contribute to a sense of suspense. The situation is intense and high-stakes, making it very suspenseful.
