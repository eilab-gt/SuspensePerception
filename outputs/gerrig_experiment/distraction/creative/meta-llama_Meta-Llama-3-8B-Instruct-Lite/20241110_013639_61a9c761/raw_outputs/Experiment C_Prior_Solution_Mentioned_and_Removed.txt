Answering Question 1:

* "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"

I would choose 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and they have taken measures to ensure that he is securely tied up. It seems unlikely that Bond will be able to escape on his own, especially since Crushak has been ordered to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him.

Answering Question 2:

* "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"

I would choose 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being trapped and helpless against his captors. The use of words like "gun", "pointing at his chest", "eliminating", and "shoot you if you even attempt to speak to him" creates a sense of urgency and foreboding. The description of Bond's physical suffering as Crushak wraps piano wire around his arms is also particularly harrowing, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
