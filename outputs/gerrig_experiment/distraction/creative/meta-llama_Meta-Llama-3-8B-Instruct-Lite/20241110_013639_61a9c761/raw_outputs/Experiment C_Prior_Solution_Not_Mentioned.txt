Answer to Question 1:
1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and it seems unlikely that he will escape from their clutches without some sort of assistance or plan.

Answer to Question 2:
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it sets up a tense and dangerous situation for Bond. He is trapped, pinned down, and being threatened by a large and menacing man, with no clear way out. The use of descriptive language, such as "large and ugly", "painfully", and "grunted to indicate" adds to the tension and suspense, making the reader feel that Bond is in a precarious and potentially deadly situation.
