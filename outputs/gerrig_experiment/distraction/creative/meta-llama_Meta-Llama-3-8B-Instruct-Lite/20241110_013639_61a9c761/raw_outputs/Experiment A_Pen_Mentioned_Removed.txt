Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Given the situation where Bond and Vesper are prisoners of Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and Le Chiffre has possession of Bond's gun and fountain pen, it's unlikely that Bond will escape on his own.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of urgency and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors, and there's a sense of tension and uncertainty as to what will happen to him. The use of vivid language, such as "crashed to the ground", "agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed", and "read his thoughts" adds to the suspense and immerses the reader in the scene. The quick succession of events, including the fight, the search, and the removal of Bond's weapons, creates a sense of fast-paced action and raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
