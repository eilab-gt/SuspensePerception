Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage indicates that Bond has been captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and is currently being searched and disarmed. This suggests that he is at a disadvantage and unlikely to escape from his captors.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful as it describes Bond being taken prisoner by his enemies and being disarmed. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or not. The use of action-packed language, such as "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins", "crashed to the ground", and "twisted sharply", creates a sense of tension and excitement, making the passage very suspenseful.
