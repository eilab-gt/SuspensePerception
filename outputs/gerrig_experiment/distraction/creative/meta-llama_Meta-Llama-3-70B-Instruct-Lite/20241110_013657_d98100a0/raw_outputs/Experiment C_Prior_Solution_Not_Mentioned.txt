I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't provide clear hints about Bond's chances of escape. While Bond has shown some resourcefulness by trying to distract Blofeld, he's currently trapped and tied up. It's uncertain whether he'll be able to escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful, as it describes Bond's attempt to escape and the subsequent capture by Blofeld's henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the contorted face of Mr. Crushak, adds to the tense atmosphere. The passage effectively conveys a sense of danger and uncertainty, making it very suspenseful.
