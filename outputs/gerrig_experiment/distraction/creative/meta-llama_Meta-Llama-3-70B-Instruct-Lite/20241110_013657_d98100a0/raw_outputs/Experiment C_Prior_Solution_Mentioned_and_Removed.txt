I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. Although Bond has shown resourcefulness in the past, he is currently in a precarious situation, tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld's henchman, Crushak. The passage doesn't provide enough information to suggest a clear escape route for Bond, making his chances of escape uncertain.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond in a vulnerable position and Blofeld's menacing presence. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful twisting of the piano wire around Bond's arms, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The threat of death or harm is implicit, making the reader wonder what will happen next.
