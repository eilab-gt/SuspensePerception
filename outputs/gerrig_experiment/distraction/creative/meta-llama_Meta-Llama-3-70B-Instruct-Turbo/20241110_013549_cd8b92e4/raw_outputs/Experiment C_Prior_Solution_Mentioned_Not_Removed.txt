**Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"**
I would answer: 5. Moderately likely

Although Bond is currently trapped and tied up, he has a history of outwitting his captors (as mentioned in the passage). This suggests that he might have a chance to escape, but it's not a guarantee.

**Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"**
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and helpless. The description of the scene, including the sudden bird crashing into the wall and the darkening of the room, adds to the tension. The introduction of the menacing Mr. Crushak and the painful piano wire binding also contribute to the sense of danger and suspense. The reader is left wondering how Bond will escape, if he will escape at all.
