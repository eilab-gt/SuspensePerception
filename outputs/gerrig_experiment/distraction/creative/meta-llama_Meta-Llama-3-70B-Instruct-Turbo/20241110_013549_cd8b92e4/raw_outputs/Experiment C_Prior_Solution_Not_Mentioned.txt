Based on the passage, I would answer:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage shows Bond attempting to escape but being caught by Blofeld's henchman, Mr. Crushak. However, it's a James Bond novel, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from seemingly impossible situations. Therefore, it's difficult to say whether Bond will ultimately escape or not.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and action-packed scene where Bond tries to escape from Blofeld's trap. The sudden appearance of the large bird, the darkness, and the threat of Mr. Crushak's gun all contribute to a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is being tied up and left to contemplate his situation adds to the sense of suspense, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next.
