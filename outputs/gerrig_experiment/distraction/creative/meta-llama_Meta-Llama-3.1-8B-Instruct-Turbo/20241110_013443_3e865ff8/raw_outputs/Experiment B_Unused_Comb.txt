Answering Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"
Given that Bond has already been caught by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and the two men have thoroughly searched him, stripping him of his revolver and pocket comb, it seems that Bond is not in a position to escape easily. However, Bond is described as being agile and skilled in hand-to-hand combat, so it's not entirely impossible that he might find a way to escape. 

Therefore, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 2. Somewhat likely

Answering Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"
This passage is full of elements that create tension and suspense. There's a sudden and unexpected entrance of three men, with guns drawn, into Bond's hotel room. Bond's actions are rapid and agile, and he suffers a minor injury, but we're left wondering if he'll escape from his captors. Le Chiffre's menacing behavior, such as patting Bond down and taking away his comb, adds to the sense of danger and suspense.

Therefore, I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful
