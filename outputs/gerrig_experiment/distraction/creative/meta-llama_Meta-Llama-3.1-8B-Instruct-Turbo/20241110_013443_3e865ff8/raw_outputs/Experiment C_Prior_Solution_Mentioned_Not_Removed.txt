**Answer to Question 1:**
The correct answer is: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is overpowered by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and is currently being restrained by piano wire. This makes it unlikely that he will escape without further intervention or a plan.

**Answer to Question 2:**
The correct answer is: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation with Bond, a skilled operative, being caught and restrained by his captors, with a not-so-subtle threat of violence from Crushak, and a hint of Blofeld's sinister intent. The sudden turn of events, such as the bird crashing into the wall and the introduction of the armed man, creates tension and keeps the reader engaged and worried for Bond's fate.
