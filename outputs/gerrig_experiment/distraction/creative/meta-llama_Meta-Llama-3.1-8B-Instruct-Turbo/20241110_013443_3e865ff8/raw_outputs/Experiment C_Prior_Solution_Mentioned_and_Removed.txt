**Answer to Question 1:**
Based on the passage, I would choose option 1: "Not very likely". Bond has been caught and tied up by a large and violent man, Crushak, who has orders to shoot him if he tries to escape or speak. Blofeld also seems to be confident that Bond will not be able to escape, and there is no indication in the passage that Bond has a clear plan or opportunity to escape. Therefore, it seems that Bond is in a precarious and vulnerable situation.

**Answer to Question 2:**
Based on the passage, I would choose option 7: "Extremely suspenseful". The passage describes a tense and threatening situation where Bond is captured and threatened with violence. The use of words like "crashed", "gunshot", "stumbled", "knocked out", "pinning", "painfully", and "orders to shoot" creates a sense of danger and foreboding, and the description of Crushak as a large and ugly man who is devoted to eliminating Bond adds to the tension. Overall, the passage has a high level of suspense, as the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next.
