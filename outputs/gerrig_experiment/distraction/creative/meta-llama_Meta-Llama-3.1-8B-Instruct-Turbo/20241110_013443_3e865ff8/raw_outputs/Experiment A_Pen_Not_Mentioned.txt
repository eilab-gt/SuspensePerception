**Answer to Question 1:** 1. Not very likely

Based on the passage, it seems that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned. Le Chiffre has set a trap for Bond and has already managed to subdue him, taking his revolver. While Bond is agile and resourceful, it seems unlikely that he will be able to escape without further assistance or a significant turn of events. Therefore, the likelihood of Bond escaping from Le Chiffre is not very high.

**Answer to Question 2:** 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage creates a sense of tension and danger as Bond is caught by Le Chiffre's trap and is being subdued by the two gunmen. The description of Bond's quick actions and the Corsican's agility in dodging Bond's kick and twisting his shoe creates a sense of fast-paced action. The fact that Bond is outnumbered and outgunned adds to the tension, making the reader wonder what will happen next. The passage leaves the reader with a sense of uncertainty, which is a hallmark of suspenseful writing.
