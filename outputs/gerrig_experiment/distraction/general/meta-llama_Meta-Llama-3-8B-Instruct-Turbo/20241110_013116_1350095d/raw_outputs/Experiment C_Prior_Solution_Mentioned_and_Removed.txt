Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, given that Bond is currently tied up in a chair, Crushak is armed, and Blofeld has explicitly stated that Crushak will shoot Bond if he tries to escape or speak to him.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is trapped and helpless, and that Blofeld and Crushak are determined to eliminate him. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" Crushak, and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of unease and fear. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape or survive the ordeal.
