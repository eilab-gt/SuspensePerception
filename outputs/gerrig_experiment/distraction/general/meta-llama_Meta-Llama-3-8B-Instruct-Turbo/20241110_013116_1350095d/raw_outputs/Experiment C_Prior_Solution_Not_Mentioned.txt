**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld's trap, as he is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, Crushak and the other unnamed gunman. Bond is also physically restrained by the piano wire, making it difficult for him to escape.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. Bond is trapped and being held captive by Blofeld, who is not amused by his actions. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "very large and very ugly" to describe Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The passage also builds anticipation and raises questions about how Bond will escape or what will happen to him next. The dark and ominous tone of the scene, with the broken light and the darkness of the office, also contributes to the suspenseful atmosphere.
