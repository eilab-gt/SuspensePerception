Answering Question 1:

I would choose option 1: Not very likely. Bond is trapped, and Le Chiffre has taken away his gun and pocket comb, leaving him without any means of escape. Additionally, Bond is described as feeling "puny and impotent", which suggests that his chances of escape are slim.

Answering Question 2:

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. The passage is full of tension and surprise, from the sudden burst of the door to the unexpected twist of Bond's shoe being caught. The description of Bond's feelings of impotence and puniness adds to the sense of danger and uncertainty, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
