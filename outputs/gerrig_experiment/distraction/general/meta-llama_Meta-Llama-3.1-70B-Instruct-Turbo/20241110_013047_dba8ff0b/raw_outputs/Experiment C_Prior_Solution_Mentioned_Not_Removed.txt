***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although the passage describes Bond being tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, James Bond is a skilled secret agent known for his resourcefulness and ability to escape from difficult situations. Given his past successes and the fact that he was able to momentarily gain the upper hand earlier in the passage, it's likely that he will find a way to escape from Blofeld's captivity.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would answer: 7. Extremely suspenseful

The passage is full of tense moments, from the sudden distraction of the bird crashing into the glass wall to Bond's brief attempt to escape, only to be thwarted by Crushak. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the ugly appearance of Crushak and the painful twisting of the piano wire, adds to the sense of tension and suspense. The fact that Blofeld is determined to eliminate Bond and has a henchman devoted to carrying out his wishes creates a sense of urgency and raises the stakes, making the passage extremely suspenseful.
