***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***

I would choose option 6: Very likely. 

Although the passage shows Bond being captured and disarmed by Le Chiffre and his men, Bond's character and the typical James Bond plot suggest that he will likely find a way to escape or turn the tables on his captors. Bond's actions, such as moving his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, also imply that he is planning something.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would choose option 7: Extremely suspenseful. 

The passage is full of tension and suspense, with Bond being captured, disarmed, and at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his men. The use of action-packed language, such as "Like lightning" and "whistled past his hip", creates a sense of urgency and danger. The fact that Bond is trying to come up with a plan to escape, and that Le Chiffre seems to be anticipating his moves, adds to the suspense. The passage effectively creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about what will happen next, making it extremely suspenseful.
