***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***

Considering the passage, I would rate the likelihood of Bond's escape as 6. Very likely. Although Bond is currently tied up and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman, Bond has already shown his resourcefulness in the passage by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the glass wall. This suggests that Bond is likely to find another opportunity to escape, given his skills and experience.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***

I would rate the suspense level of the passage as 7. Extremely suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and urgency, with Bond facing imminent danger from Blofeld and his henchman. The use of vivid imagery, such as the bird crashing into the glass wall and the ugly face of Mr. Crushak, adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. The fact that Bond is tied up and at the mercy of his captors also raises the stakes, making the reader wonder how he will manage to escape.
