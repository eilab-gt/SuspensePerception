Answering Question 1:

* How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?
I would choose option 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and it seems that Blofeld has taken measures to ensure that Bond will not be able to escape, such as having Crushak tie him up using piano wire. Bond's previous attempts to outwit Blofeld's guards in the past have been unsuccessful, and it seems that Blofeld is determined to keep Bond captive this time as well.

Answering Question 2:

* How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?
I would choose option 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and helpless against Blofeld's henchman Crushak. The use of vivid and ominous descriptions, such as "a very large and very ugly man", "a piece of piano wire", and "the large light that had illuminated the room" creates a sense of foreboding and unease. The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond and whether he will be able to escape from his captors. The passage also raises questions about the fate of Bond's ally
