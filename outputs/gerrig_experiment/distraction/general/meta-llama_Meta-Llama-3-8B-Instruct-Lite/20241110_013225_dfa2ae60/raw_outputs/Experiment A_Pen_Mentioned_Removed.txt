Answer 1: I would choose option 1, "Not very likely". Bond is overpowered by Le Chiffre and his two gunmen, and is being searched and disarmed, which doesn't bode well for his chances of escape.

Answer 2: I would choose option 6, "Very suspenseful". The passage is full of tension and danger, with Bond being overpowered, and the threat of violence and capture hanging over him. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "crashed to the ground", and "gun trained on Bond's unquiet chest" creates a sense of urgency and danger, making the passage very suspenseful.
