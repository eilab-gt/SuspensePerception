Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a precarious situation, being captured by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and is at their mercy. The fact that they are searching him for other weaponry and twisting his arm to remove his revolver implies that he is in a vulnerable position, making it "Not very likely" that he will escape.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful as it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a difficult situation and is being held captive by Le Chiffre, which creates a sense of unease. The use of action-packed language, such as "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins and brought a whistle of pain from him", and "he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion in which he took great pride, he righted himself with minimal damage" adds to the suspense. The passage also creates a sense of uncertainty, as the reader is unsure of what will happen to Bond next, making it "Very suspenseful".
