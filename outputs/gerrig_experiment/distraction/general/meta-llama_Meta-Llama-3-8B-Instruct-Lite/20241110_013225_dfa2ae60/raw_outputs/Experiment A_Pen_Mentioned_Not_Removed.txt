Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

It seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point, as he has been overpowered by the two gunmen and is being searched for any hidden weapons. Le Chiffre's control over the situation is evident, and Bond's attempts to escape seem to be foiled by the Corsican's quick reflexes and Le Chiffre's orders to search him thoroughly.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful, as it creates a sense of tension and danger around Bond's predicament.

The reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next and whether he will be able to escape from his captors. The passage also builds on the previous events, creating a sense of escalating tension and suspense.
