Answer to Question 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is trapped and disarmed, and he is at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He is unable to escape, and his attempts to resist are met with success by Le Chiffre's men. This suggests that Bond's chances of escape are slim.

Answer to Question 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is extremely suspenseful because it sets up a sense of tension and danger. Bond, who was previously confident and successful, is suddenly caught off guard and overpowered by Le Chiffre's men. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "the door burst in toward him" and "Bond crashed to the ground", adds to the sense of drama and suspense. The passage also creates a sense of unease and vulnerability, as Bond is left feeling "puny and impotent" and at the mercy of his captors. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to build tension and suspense, drawing the reader in and making them feel like they are right there with Bond, experiencing his fear and helplessness.
