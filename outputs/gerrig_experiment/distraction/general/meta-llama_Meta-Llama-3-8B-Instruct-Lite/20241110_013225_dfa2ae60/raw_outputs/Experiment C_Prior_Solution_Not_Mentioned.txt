Answer 1: 1. Not very likely

Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman Crushak, and he is being restrained with piano wire. It seems unlikely that he will escape from this situation without some kind of outside help or a clever plan.

Answer 2: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger. The reader is aware that Bond is in a precarious situation and that he is at the mercy of his captors. The use of vivid descriptions, such as the "large and very ugly" man Crushak, adds to the sense of unease. The passage also creates a sense of claustrophobia, with Bond being trapped in a chair with no clear way to escape. Overall, the passage is expertly crafted to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.
