**Question 1: How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?**
I would answer 1. Not very likely. Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, who has been ordered to shoot him if he tries to speak to him. The situation seems dire, and Bond's chances of escape appear slim.

**Question 2: How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?**
I would answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage is filled with tension and danger, as Bond is trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The description of the events is vivid and intense, making it easy to imagine the scene and feel the sense of urgency and fear. The reader is left wondering if Bond will be able to escape or if he will meet a dire fate.
