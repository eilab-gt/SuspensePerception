I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would choose option 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't give a clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond has shown some resourcefulness and agility, he is currently at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose option 6: Very suspenseful. The passage is full of tense and intense moments, such as Bond's attempt to rescue Vesper, the sudden twist where the Corsican catches Bond's shoe, and the subsequent search and stripping of Bond's weapons. The sense of danger and uncertainty is palpable, making it a very suspenseful passage.
