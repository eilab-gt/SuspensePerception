***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage sets up a precarious situation for Bond, but it's a James Bond novel, so it's hard to predict whether he'll escape or not. The fact that Bond has already tried to escape once and was caught suggests that it might not be easy, but Bond is a skilled agent, so he might still find a way out.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a tense atmosphere, with Bond being trapped and at the mercy of Blofeld and his henchman. The use of descriptive language, such as the "very large and very ugly man" and the painful wire binding Bond's arms, adds to the sense of danger and tension. The threat of being shot if Bond even attempts to speak to Crushak raises the stakes, making the passage very suspenseful.
