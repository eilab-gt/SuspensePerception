I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4: Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide a clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond has attempted to escape earlier, he was caught and is now tied up. However, Bond's history of outwitting his captors suggests that he might still find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6: Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the sudden interruption by the bird, Bond's attempt to escape, and his subsequent capture. The description of Crushak's ugly appearance and the painful wire binding add to the sense of danger and unease, making the passage very suspenseful.
