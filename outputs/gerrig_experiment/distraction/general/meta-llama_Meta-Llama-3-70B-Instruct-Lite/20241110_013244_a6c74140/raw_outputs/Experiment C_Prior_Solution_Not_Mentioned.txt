I'll answer the questions based on the provided passage.

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would choose answer 4. Neutral or Uncertain. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine Bond's chances of escape, and it's unclear what will happen next. While Bond has been caught and tied up, it's a James Bond story, and Bond is known for his ability to escape from difficult situations.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would choose answer 6. Very suspenseful. The passage creates a sense of tension and danger, with Bond being caught and tied up by Blofeld's henchman. The description of Crushak's ugly face and the painful wire binding Bond's arms adds to the sense of unease. The passage effectively builds suspense by leaving the reader wondering what will happen to Bond next.
