**Answer to Question 1:**
Given the situation, I would rate the likelihood of Bond escaping from Blofeld as follows: 1. Not very likely

The reason for this answer is that Bond is currently a prisoner of Blofeld and his henchman, Crushak, who is armed and has orders to shoot Bond if he attempts to speak to him. Additionally, Bond is physically restrained by piano wire, making it difficult for him to escape or defend himself.

**Answer to Question 2:**
I would rate the suspensefulness of this passage as: 7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage creates a sense of tension and danger, as Bond is in a precarious situation, trapped and at the mercy of his captors. The use of vivid descriptions of the setting and the characters, as well as the threat of violence and the physical pain Bond is experiencing, contribute to the high level of suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or find a way out of this situation.
