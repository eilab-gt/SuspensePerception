**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

Bond has just been caught by Le Chiffre's gunmen and is being disarmed. The text states that the two gunmen "dragged Bond to his feet" and that Le Chiffre's assistant "roughly stripped Bond's revolver out of its shoulder holster." This suggests that Bond is currently in a difficult and vulnerable position, making it not very likely that he will escape from Le Chiffre at this point.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and intense situation where Bond is caught off guard and is being overpowered by Le Chiffre's gunmen. The use of words like "suddenly," "like lightning," and "brusquely" creates a sense of urgency and quick action, which adds to the suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or what Le Chiffre's intentions are, making it a very suspenseful passage.
