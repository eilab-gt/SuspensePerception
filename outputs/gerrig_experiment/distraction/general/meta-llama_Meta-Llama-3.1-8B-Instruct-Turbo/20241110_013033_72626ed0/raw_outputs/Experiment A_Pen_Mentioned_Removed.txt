**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond has been caught off guard and is now a prisoner of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. He has been disarmed and is being handled roughly, which indicates that the situation is not in his favor. Additionally, the fact that Le Chiffre has been able to anticipate Bond's thoughts and actions implies that he has a significant upper hand. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre at this point.

**Answer to Question 2:**
6. Very suspenseful

This passage is very suspenseful because it describes a high-stakes situation where Bond's life is in danger. The use of phrases like "With a backward kick which connected with the thin man's shins" and "Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage" creates a sense of urgency and tension. The fact that Bond is being disarmed and handled roughly by Le Chiffre's men adds to the suspense, and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The passage effectively builds tension and creates a sense of uncertainty, making it very suspenseful.
