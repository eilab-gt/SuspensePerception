**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

This answer is chosen because Bond is currently being held captive by Blofeld and his two gunmen, and there is no indication in the passage that he has any immediate plan to escape. The passage also mentions that the last guard who held Bond captive died in an automobile accident, implying that Blofeld's previous captives have met with tragic ends.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This answer is chosen because the passage is full of tense and ominous moments, such as Bond being trapped in the dark, being met by a large and ugly man with a gun, and being tied up with piano wire. The passage also implies that Bond is in grave danger, and the mention of the previous guard's death adds to the sense of foreboding and tension.
