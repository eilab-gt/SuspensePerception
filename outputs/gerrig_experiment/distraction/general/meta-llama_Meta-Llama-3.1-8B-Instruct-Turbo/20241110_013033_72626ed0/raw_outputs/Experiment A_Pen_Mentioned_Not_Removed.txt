**Answer to Question 1:**
Given that Bond has been caught by Le Chiffre's trap and is now a prisoner, it is unlikely that he will escape. The fact that he has been disarmed and is being held by two gunmen and Le Chiffre himself suggests that his chances of escape are low. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. Not very likely

**Answer to Question 2:**
This passage is suspenseful because it describes a tense situation where Bond is trying to escape from his captors, and the outcome is uncertain. The use of words like "suddenly", "like lightning", and "brusquely" creates a sense of urgency and quick action, which adds to the suspense. The fact that Bond is being disarmed and is at the mercy of his captors also adds to the tension. Therefore, the correct answer is:

7. Extremely suspenseful
