**Answer to Question 1:**
1. Not very likely

The passage suggests that Bond is in a difficult situation. He is tied up in a chair by a large and ugly man, Crushak, who is devoted to eliminating "irritations" from Blofeld's life. Blofeld has also laid a successful trap for Bond, and Bond is currently a prisoner. Given these circumstances, it seems unlikely that Bond will escape from Blofeld at this point.

**Answer to Question 2:**
7. Extremely suspenseful

This passage is extremely suspenseful because it creates a sense of tension and danger for the protagonist, James Bond. The sudden interruption by the bird, the unexpected appearance of the large and ugly man, Crushak, and the subsequent capture and torture of Bond all contribute to a high level of suspense. The reader is left wondering what will happen next and whether Bond will be able to escape or if he will suffer further at the hands of Blofeld and his henchman.
