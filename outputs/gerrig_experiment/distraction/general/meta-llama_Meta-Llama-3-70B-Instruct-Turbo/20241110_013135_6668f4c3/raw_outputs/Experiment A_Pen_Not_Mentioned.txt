Based on the passage, I would answer the questions as follows:

***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage shows Bond being caught by Le Chiffre and his gunmen, and being disarmed and searched. However, it also shows Bond's quick thinking and agility in trying to escape and do damage to his captors. This suggests that Bond is resourceful and may have a chance to escape, but it's not clear at this point whether he will be successful.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
6. Very suspenseful

The passage is very suspenseful because it describes a tense and dangerous situation where Bond is being captured and threatened by Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The use of words like "whistle of pain", "slammed", "shot out his left hand", and "barked" creates a sense of urgency and violence, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to Bond next. The fact that Bond is being disarmed and searched also raises the stakes and makes the situation feel more precarious.
