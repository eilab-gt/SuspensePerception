***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Le Chiffre?"***
I would answer: 4. Neutral or Uncertain

The passage doesn't give a clear indication of whether Bond will escape or not. While Bond has shown some agility and quick thinking, he is currently at the mercy of Le Chiffre and his gunmen. The situation seems precarious, but Bond's character is known for his resourcefulness, so it's hard to predict the outcome.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage is quite suspenseful, as Bond is in a dangerous situation, and the reader is left wondering what will happen to him and Vesper. The use of action words like "hurled", "slammed", "whistled", and "barked" creates a sense of urgency and tension. The fact that Bond's plan is thwarted and he's being searched and disarmed adds to the suspense. The reader is left on edge, wondering how Bond will get out of this predicament.
