***Question 1: "How likely is it that Bond will escape from Blofeld?"***
I would answer: 6. Very likely

Although Bond is currently in a precarious situation, being tied up by Blofeld's henchman Crushak, the passage does not suggest that Bond's situation is hopeless. Bond has already shown his resourcefulness by taking advantage of the distraction caused by the bird crashing into the wall, and the tone of the passage implies that Bond will find a way to escape.

***Question 2: "How suspenseful do you find this passage to be?"***
I would answer: 6. Very suspenseful

The passage creates a sense of tension and suspense through the use of descriptive language, such as the "large and very ugly man" and the "painfully" biting piano wire. The situation is clearly dangerous for Bond, and the reader is left wondering how he will manage to escape. The passage also raises questions about what will happen to Bond next, which adds to the suspense. Overall, the passage is well-written and effectively creates a sense of suspense.
