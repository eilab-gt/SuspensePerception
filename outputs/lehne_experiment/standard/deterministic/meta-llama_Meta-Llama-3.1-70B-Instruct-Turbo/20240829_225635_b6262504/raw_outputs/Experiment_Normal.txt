Suspense level: 4

This paragraph is a bit of a letdown after the ominous tone of the first paragraph. The event that Nathanael describes as "terrible" is actually quite mundane - a barometer dealer coming to his room and being rejected.

However, the fact that the story has reached a conclusion and the tension has been released means
Suspense level: 9

This paragraph is a great conclusion to the story, as it ties together the various threads and reveals the true identity of the barometer dealer. The fact that Coppelius has not changed his name and is still using a variant of it (Giuseppe Coppola) is a clever touch, and the revelation that he is the same person who killed Nathanael's father is a shocking one. The fact that Nathanael is determined to take revenge on Coppel
