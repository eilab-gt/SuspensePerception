The mention of the Sandman's presence is a reminder of the dark and ominous figure that has been lurking in the shadows, but it's more of a hint at what's to come rather than a direct threat. The narrator's statement about a "dark fate" hanging over his life is a ominous one, but it's more of a general statement than a specific threat, and it doesn't create a sense of immediate danger or suspense. Overall, this paragraph is more of a conclusion to the story than a continuation of the suspenseful narrative.
