1 Nathanael to Lothar: I have been working on a series of drawings, and I have come to the conclusion that they are the work of the same hand that created the terrifying image of the Sandman. – I have been haunted by this figure ever since I saw the drawings. – I can't get it out of my mind, and it seems to be following me everywhere I go. 5

1 Nathanael to Lothar: When I was a child, I was very sensitive and imaginative. I was particularly fond of fairy tales and legends, and I spent many hours lost in their enchanting worlds. One story in particular, the story of the Sandman, had a profound effect on me. The Sandman was said to be a terrifying figure who came to children at night and put grains of sand in their eyes to make

1 Nathanael to Lothar: One day, when I was about seven years old, I was sitting in my father's study, looking at a picture book, when I suddenly heard a loud knock on the door. My father called out, "Come in!" and the door opened. A tall, thin man with a long, thin face and a long, thin nose entered. He was the barometer dealer who had come to offer his goods. He

1 Nathanael to Lothar: As I grew older, I began to doubt the truth of the old woman's story. I told myself that it was just a fairy tale, and I tried to forget about the Sandman. But every time I heard the sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs, the image of the Sandman would come back to me, and I would feel a shiver of fear. I tried to tell myself that it was

1 Nathanael to Lothar: One day, when I was about twelve years old, I decided to find out the truth about the Sandman. I waited until my father was out of the house, and then I went into his study and looked around for something that might give me a clue. I found a small, old book on the shelf, bound in leather, with a strange, mysterious title. I opened it and began to read. The book was

1 Nathanael to Lothar: I saw my father sitting in his armchair, smoking his pipe, and the barometer dealer standing in front of him. The dealer was holding a small, round box in his hand, and my father was examining it with great interest. Suddenly, the dealer opened the box, and I saw a small, round, glass eye staring at me. I was so terrified that I could hardly breathe. The dealer took the eye

1 Nathanael to Lothar: I saw the barometer dealer standing in the doorway, his face twisted with rage. He was holding the small, round, glass eye in his hand, and he was looking around the room with a wild, mad look. Suddenly, he saw me, and his eyes widened in horror. He let out a scream and threw the eye at me. I ducked, and the eye shattered on the floor. The

1 Nathanael to Lothar: I was so terrified that I could hardly breathe. I turned and ran out of the room, down the stairs, and out of the house. I ran as fast as I could, not stopping until I reached the forest. I hid behind a tree and waited until I was sure that the Sandman had left the house. Then I went back home, but I could not bring myself to enter the house. I spent the

1 Nathanael to Lothar: My father took a small, round, glass eye from a box and held it over the flame. Suddenly, the eye began to boil and bubble, and a terrible stench rose from it. Coppelius took a pair of long, sharp tweezers and plunged them into the boiling eye. He pulled out a small, round, white object, which he put on a small, round, silver
