1 Nathanael's dream: I was in a large, dimly lit room. A woman was sitting on a high, ornate throne. Her face was hideous, and her eyes burned like glowing coal. She spoke to me in a voice that was both soft and terrifying, telling me that I would be her slave and would have to do her bidding. I tried to escape, but I couldn't move.  Then I saw a

My mother was a gentle, kind woman who took care of me and my younger sister. We lived in a small, simple house, but we were happy. I was a sensitive child, and I loved to draw and to dream. I spent many hours alone, lost in my thoughts. One day,

1 Nathanael's fear of the Sandman: I was terrified of the Sandman. I had heard that he came every night and sprinkled sand into the eyes of children who didn't go to bed on time. I was afraid that he would come for me and blind me. I would lie in bed, listening for the sound of his heavy footsteps, and I would shiver with fear. I would pull the covers over my head and try to

1 Nathanael's encounter with the Sandman: One day, as I was walking through the woods near my home, I came across an old, strange-looking man. He was tall and thin, with a long, pointed beard and a hat that was pulled down over his eyes. I felt a strange feeling of recognition when I looked at him, and I knew that he was the Sandman. I followed him, trying to keep a safe distance, and

I was filled with a mixture of fear and excitement as I watched him. I wanted to see him clearly, to understand who he really was. I took a step closer, and the Sandman looked up and saw me. He smiled, and his eyes seemed to burn like

"Nathanael," he said, "I have come for you. You have grown up now, and it is time for you to join my children in the half-moon. But don
     9

1 Nathanael's encounter with the Sandman: I watched as my father and Coppelius began to work. They were making glass eyes. I had never seen anything like it. They took small pieces of glass and heated them in the fire until they glowed red-hot, and then they blew into them until they cooled and formed into beautiful, round eyes. I was fascinated by the process, but I also felt a growing sense of dread.
     10

1 Nathanael's escape: I screamed and struggled, but Coppelius was too strong. I felt the hot coals burning my eyes, and I felt my sight begin to fade. I felt myself being lifted off the stove, and I thought I was going to die. But then, just as suddenly as the darkness had come over me, it disappeared. I was lying on the floor, and I could see again. I looked up and saw my

     7

1 Nathanael's recovery and reflection: I recovered from my illness, but I was never quite the same. I was more sensitive and more introspective. I began to question everything I had been taught and to think for myself. I became more and more distant from my family and friends, and I spent more and more time alone. I began to read and to write, and I found solace in my art. I became a lawyer, and I moved
     8

1 Nathanael's encounter with the Sandman (again): I followed my mother and siblings out of the room, and I heard my father's voice calling after us. "Nathanael!" he said.

     10

1 Nathanael's discovery: I pushed open the door and went into my father's room. I saw my father lying on the floor, his body twisted and contorted. He was dead. Coppelius was standing over him, a knife in his hand. I screamed and fell to my knees. I felt a sense of horror and disbelief wash over me. I looked at Coppelius, and I felt a wave of hatred and rev
     8

1 Nathanael's aftermath: I was left alone with my mother and sisters. We were poor, and we struggled to make ends meet. I took care of my mother and sisters, and I tried to put the terrible event behind me. I threw myself into my work, and I became a successful lawyer. I never forgot the Sandman, but I tried to forget. I never spoke of him to anyone, and I never told my wife or children about
     9

1 Nathanael's plan for revenge: I set out to find Coppelius, determined to confront him and seek revenge for my father's death. I searched for him for months, and I finally tracked him down to a small town in the Black Forest. I went to his house, and I found him working in his workshop. I confronted him, and I demanded justice for my father. Coppelius laughed and mocked me, but I

        6

1 Clara's explanation: Clara wrote to Nathanael, explaining that she understood why he had been acting strangely. She told him that she knew that he had been troubled by the memory of old Coppelius, and she knew that the Sandman from the fairy tale had been associated with him in his mind.

1 Clara's comforting words: Clara wrote to Nathanael, comforting him and encouraging him to put Coppelius and Coppola out of his mind.

1 Nathanael's frustration: Nathanael wrote to Lothar, expressing his frustration that Klara had opened and read the letter to him by mistake.

        5

1 Nathanael's suspicions: Nathanael wrote to Lothar, expressing his suspicions about Coppola. He told him that it was certain that Coppola was not the same person as Coppelius, the lawyer.

He felt uneasy and crept away quietly into the auditorium next door

1 Nathanael's revelation: Nathanael wrote to Lothar, telling him that he had learned that the figure he had seen was Spallanzani's daughter Olimpia, who had been locked up in a strange and bad way, so that no one was allowed to go near her.

 7

1 Nathanael's change: Nathanael wrote to Lothar, explaining that he was right when he had written to him that the repulsive figure of Coppola had entered his life in a very hostile way. He told him that everyone could feel this, as Nathanael's whole being had changed completely in the first few days. He told him that he used to have a particular strength in charming, lively stories, which
     10

1 Nathanael's poem and the Sandman: Nathanael wrote a poem about the figure of the ugly Coppelius, and he had a dark premonition that Coppelius would spoil his happiness in love. He depicted himself and Clara, united in faithful love, but then it was as if a black fist reached into their lives and tore away some joy. Finally, when they were already standing at the altar, the terrible

1 Nathanael's reaction to his poem: Nathanael wrote a poem about the figure of the ugly Coppelius, and he was calm and collected while he was writing it. But when he finished and read it out loud, he was seized with horror and cried out. He felt as if the poem was a success, and it seemed to him as if it would ignite Clara's cold mind. He wondered who the horrible voice was that belonged
 6

1 Nathanael and Clara's reunion: Nathanael and Clara were sitting in their mother's little garden. Clara was very cheerful because Nathanael had not tormented her with his dreams and premonitions for the three days in which he had been writing a poem.

 9

1 Nathanael's breakdown: Nathanael was drawn away by his poetry, and his inner fire colored his cheeks bright red. He was unable to resist, and tears welled up from his eyes. Klara tried to comfort him, but he pushed her away and shouted at her, accusing her of being a lifeless automaton. Klara was deeply hurt by his words, and she shed bitter tears, saying that he didn't understand her
 8

1 Nathanael and Lothar's duel: Lothar went into the arbor to talk to Klara, and she told him what had happened. Every word of her accusation fell like a spark into Nathanael's heart, and the resentment he had long harbored against the dreamy Nathanael flared up into wild anger. He ran to Nathanael and reproached him for his senseless
  9

1 Klara's intervention: Klara heard the fierce argument and saw that the fencing master brought the swords at dusk. She suspected what was about to happen, and when they arrived at the battlefield, Lothar and Nathanael had just thrown off their coats in gloomy silence. With bloodthirsty fighting spirit in their burning eyes, they were about to attack each other when Klara rushed through the garden gate. Sobbing
  10

1 Reconciliation: Lothar lowered his weapon and looked down at the ground in silence, but in Nathanael's heart all the love he had ever felt for the lovely Clara was rekindled in heart-rending melancholy.

 6

1 Nathanael's observations: Nathanael paid no particular attention to the fact that he lived opposite Professor Spallanzani, and it seemed no more unusual to him when he noticed that from his window he could see straight into the room where Olimpia often sat alone.

1 Nathanael's encounter with Coppola: Nathanael was writing to Klara when there was a soft knock on the door; it opened at his call, and Coppola's repulsive face looked in. Nathanael felt a trembling inside; remembering what Spallanzani had said to him about his countryman Coppola, and what he had solemnly promised his beloved about Coppelius the Sand
   10

1 Coppola's display of power: But at that moment Coppola had put his barometer aside, reached into his wide coat pockets and pulled out glasses, which he laid on the table. – “Now – now – glasses – glasses on your nose, put them on my eyes, those are my eyes – beautiful eyes!” – And with that he pulled out more and more glasses, so that the whole table began to flicker and sparkle strangely
    8

1 Nathanael's realization: Coppola gently freed himself with a hoarse laugh and with the words: “Ah! - nothing for you - but here are some nice glasses" - he had put all his glasses away and taken a number of large and small perspective glasses out of the side pocket of his coat. As soon as the glasses were gone, Nathanael became very calm and, thinking of Klara, he realized that the horrible ghost could

1 Nathanael's first sight of Olimpia: He picked up a small, very neatly made pocket perspective glass and looked through the window to examine it. Never in his life had he seen a glass that brought objects so cleanly, sharply, and clearly close to his eyes. Involuntarily he looked into Spallanzani's room; Olimpia was sitting, as usual, in front of the small table. - Now Nath

1 Nathanael's encounter with Coppola: A clearing of the throat and scratching woke him as if from a deep dream. Coppola was standing behind him: "Tre Zechini - three ducats." - Nathanael had completely forgotten about the optician, and quickly paid what was asked. "Adieu, dear friend!" - Coppola left the room, not without many strange sidelong glances at N
     7

1 Nathanael's struggle with Coppola: But he had sighed like that himself, he noticed that. "Klara," he said to himself, "is probably right to think I'm a tasteless ghost-seer." - Now he sat down to finish the letter to Klara, but a glance through the window convinced him that Olimpia was still sitting there, and in an instant, as if driven by an irresistible
    8

1 Nathanael's surprise party: When he was about to return to his apartment, he noticed a noisy commotion in Spallanzani's house.

    6

1 Olimpia's appearance: Nathanael found an invitation card and went to the professor at the appointed hour with his heart pounding. The company was large and brilliant. Olimpia appeared very richly & tastefully dressed. One had to admire her beautifully formed face & her stature. The somewhat oddly bent back & the wasp-like thinness of her body seemed to have been caused by too much constriction. There was something measured
    8

1 Olimpia's performance: The concert began. Olimpia played the piano with great skill and also performed a bravura aria in a clear, glass-bell voice. Nathanael was quite delighted; he was standing in the back row and could not quite make out Olimpia's features. So, quite unnoticed, he took out Coppola's glass&amp; looked at the beautiful Olimpia. Ah! –
     9

1 The dance: The concert was over, the ball began. To dance with her! – with her! that was now the goal of all Nathanael’s wishes. He himself did not know how it happened that, when the dance had already begun, he stood close to Olimpia, who had not yet been asked, and took her hand. Olimpia's hand was ice cold, he felt himself trembling with a terrible chill of death,
     8

1 The dance: Heated up by the dance&amp; the copious amounts of wine he had consumed, Nathanael had cast off all his usual shyness. He sat next to Olimpia, her hand in his hand, and spoke passionately of his love in words that no one understood, neither he nor Olimpia. But she did, for she looked him straight in the eye&amp; sighed over again: "Ah - ah -
     9

1 Professor Spallanzani's smile: Professor Spallanzani walked past the happy couple a few times&amp; smiled at them with strange contentment.

"Separation," he screamed wildly&amp;

1 Siegmund's explanation: "Do me a favor, brother," said Siegmund one day, "do me a favor&amp; tell me how you, clever fellow, were able to fall in love with that waxen face, that wooden doll over there?"

     9

1 Olimpia's response: Olimpia was surprised by Nathanael's sudden declaration of love, she blushed deeply. She hesitated for a moment, then said: "Ah - ah - ah!" - "Yes, my dear, glorious, glorious Nathanael, I will be yours forever!" - "Ah - ah!" - "Yes, my dear, glorious, glorious Nathanael, I will be yours
    8

1 Spallanzani's study: Already on the stairs, in the hallway, he heard a strange noise; it seemed to be coming from Spallanzani’s study. – A stamping – a clatter – a pushing – banging against the door, interspersed with curses&amp; imprecations. “Let go – let go – infamous – wicked man! – Is that why you risked your life&amp
     9

1 Nathanael's struggle: Nathanael rushed in, seized by nameless fear. The professor had grabbed a female figure by the shoulders, the Italian Coppola by the feet, and they were pulling him back, fighting in full fury for possession.

     8

1 Coppola's laughter: Then Coppola threw the figure over his shoulder&amp; ran quickly down the stairs with a horrible, piercing laughter. Nathanael stood frozen – he had seen only too clearly that Olimpia's deathly pale wax face had no eyes, but black sockets instead; she was a lifeless doll. Spallanzani rolled on the ground, shards of glass had cut his head, chest&amp

      8

1 Nathanael's capture: He would have strangled him, but the noise had attracted many people who forced their way in, tore the enraged Nathanael to his feet&amp; saved the professor. Siegmund, strong as he was, could not control the madman; he kept screaming in a terrible voice: "Wooden doll, turn around,"&amp; struck around with clenched fists. Finally,
     9

1 Klara's embrace: Klara, who had faithfully stood by his friend in great need, came in. Nathanael held out his hand to him: "You faithful brother, you have not abandoned me after all." - "Ah, ah!" - Klara's eyes glistened with tears of joy, and she took Nathanael in her arms. They stood there, embracing for a long time, and he was finally able
     8

1 Nathanael's thoughts: Every trace of madness had disappeared, and Nathanael soon regained strength in the careful care of his mother, his lover, and his friends. In the meantime, happiness had returned to the house; for an old, penniless uncle, from whom no one had hoped for anything, had left his mother, along with a not inconsiderable fortune, a small estate in a pleasant area not far from the
     8

1 The lovers' climb: It was time for the four happy people to go to the estate. At midday they walked through the streets of the town. They had bought a lot of things, the high town tower cast its gigantic shadow over the market. "Well!" said Clara, "let's climb up again&amp; and look into the distant mountains!" No sooner said than done! Both Nathanael&amp; and Clara climbed up, the

1 Klara's fear: Klara clung tightly to the railing in desperate fear of death. Nathanael, with tremendous strength, he grabbed Klara&amp; wanted to hurl her down, but Klara was not afraid to die. She felt herself being torn between the love she had for him and the fear of death. In the end, Klara, "Ah - ah - ah!" - "Yes, my dear, glorious,

1 Klara's death: Klara, seized by the madman, was floating in the air above the gallery – she was only still clutching the iron bars with one hand.  - Nathanael's heart was filled with a terrible, fear – he felt as if the madman was pulling her down.
