1  Nathanael: I have a strange story to tell you, Lothar. It is about the Sandman, who comes to children and makes their eyes close with sand. – I have often heard this story, but I never paid much attention to it. – But now I am seized by a strange fear of this Sandman. – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! –

1  Nathanael: I was born in a small town in the province of Brandenburg, where my father was a pastor. My mother died when I was still a baby, and my father married again. My stepmother was a very beautiful woman, but she was also very proud and haughty. She had a sister, who was even more beautiful and more proud than she was. My father's house was always full of guests, and I was often left alone with my stepmother's sister. She was very kind to me, and I loved her dearly. But one day, when I was about seven years old, she suddenly left the house and never came back. I was heartbroken, and I never saw her again. – I have often thought about her since then, and I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her

1  Nathanael: One evening, when I was about eight years old, I was sitting on my father's lap and looking at a picture book. It was a book of fairy tales, and the pictures were very beautiful. I was so engrossed in the book that I didn't notice that my father had fallen asleep. Suddenly I heard a loud noise, and I looked up. The picture book was lying on the floor, and my father was sitting in his armchair with his eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling. I was frightened and called out to him, but he didn't answer. I ran to my stepmother and told her what had happened. She came into the room and saw that my father was still sitting there, staring at the ceiling. She called for a doctor, and he came and said that my father was dead. – I have often thought about that evening since then, and I have often dreamed of my father sitting in his armchair with his eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling. – I have often dreamed of my father sitting in his armchair with his eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling. – I have often dreamed

1  Nathanael: I was sent to school, and I was very happy there. I made many friends, and I learned many things. But I never forgot the terrible Sandman, and I was always afraid of him. I often dreamed of him, and I was always afraid to go to bed.

1  Nathanael: One day, when I was about twelve years old, I decided to find out the truth about the Sandman. I went to the attic and looked for the old picture book that I had had as a child. I opened it and found the picture of the Sandman. It was a picture of a man with a long, thin face, a pointed beard, and a tall hat with a wide brim. He was holding a bag in one hand and a handful of sand in the other. I stared at the picture for a long time, and I felt a strange feeling of fear and fascination. I closed the book and went back to my room. I couldn't sleep that night, and I kept thinking about the Sandman. I dreamed of him, and I was afraid. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dream

1  Nathanael: I saw the Sandman standing by the fireplace, holding a glass of wine in one hand and a pipe in the other. He was a tall, thin man with a long, pointed beard and a tall hat with a wide brim. He was dressed in a long, black coat and had a strange, cold expression on his face. I was terrified, but I couldn't move. I stood there, frozen with fear, and watched as the Sandman took a sip of wine and puffed on his pipe. He didn't seem to notice me, and I wondered if he was real or just a figment of my imagination. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then

1  Nathanael: I saw the Sandman standing in the doorway, holding a bag in one hand and a handful of sand in the other. He was looking around the room, and his eyes fell on me. I was frozen with fear, and I couldn't move. The Sandman raised his hand and threw the sand at me. I closed my eyes and waited for the pain, but nothing happened. I opened my eyes, and the Sandman was gone. I was still standing there, trembling with fear and amazement. I went back to my hiding place and waited for the Sandman to leave. I didn't sleep that night, and I couldn't stop thinking about the Sandman. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. – I have often dreamed of the Sandman since then, and I have often been afraid to go to bed. –
