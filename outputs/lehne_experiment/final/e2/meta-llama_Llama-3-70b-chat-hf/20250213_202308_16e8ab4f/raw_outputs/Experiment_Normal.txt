The paragraph builds tension as Nathanael's fear and horror grow, and the sentence "The horrible apparition of the Sandman tormented me all night long" creates a sense of sustained dread.

While the mention of the Sandman and the "dark fate" that has hung over Nathanael's life is still ominous, the overall tone of the paragraph is more subdued and less suspenseful than the previous paragraphs.
