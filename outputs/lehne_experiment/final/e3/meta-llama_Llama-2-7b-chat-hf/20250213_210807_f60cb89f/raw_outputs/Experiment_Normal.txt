The use of the phrase "uncanny to us" and the mention of Olimpia being "wasted words" creates a sense of tension and conflict between the characters. The exchange between Nathanael and Siegmund is heated and emotional, and their differing opinions on Olimpia's nature adds to the suspense. However, the paragraph does not have the same level of tension and intrigue as some of the previous paragraphs, which is why I would rate it a 7 rather than a 10.
