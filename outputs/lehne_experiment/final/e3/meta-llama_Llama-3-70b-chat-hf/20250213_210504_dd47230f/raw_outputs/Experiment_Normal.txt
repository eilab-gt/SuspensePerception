I would rate this paragraph a 2 out of 10 in terms of suspense. The paragraph starts by building up the idea that something terrible has happened to Nathanael, but the revelation that it's just a barometer dealer coming to his room is quite anticlimactic. The dealer's visit seems like a mundane and harmless event, and the fact that Nathanael threatened to throw him down the stairs is more comical than suspenseful.

The sentence "I did hear heavy footsteps clattering up the stairs" is particularly effective in creating a sense of unease and suspense.

The use of words like "wicked", "bloody", and "crooked beaks" adds to the sense of horror and suspense. The fact that the narrator is a child and is trembling with fear and horror makes the scene even more unsettling. The paragraph builds up to a sense of climax, with the narrator's cry of "The Sandman! The Sandman!" and the image of the Sandman tormenting him all night long. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 out of 10 is that the suspense is more atmospheric and psychological than plot-driven, and the paragraph is more focused on creating a sense of fear and unease than on building tension or suspense through action or plot twists.

However, the paragraph is more focused on the narrator's inner thoughts and feelings than on external events or plot twists, which keeps the suspense level from being higher.

The paragraph ends on a cliffhanger, with the narrator opening the door to the living room, which adds to the sense of suspense and anticipation. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 out of 10 is that the suspense is still more atmospheric and psychological than plot-driven, and the paragraph is more focused on building tension than on delivering a shocking or surprising twist.
