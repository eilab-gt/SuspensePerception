1  Nathanael: I have a terrible story to tell you, Lothar. It is about the Sandman, who comes to children in their dreams and puts out their eyes with his finger. – I have often heard this story, but I did not believe it. – But now I am convinced that it is true. – I have seen the Sandman! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! – I have seen him! –

1  Nathanael: I was born in a small town in the province of Brandenburg, where my father was a pastor. My mother died when I was still a baby, and my father married again. My stepmother was a very beautiful woman, but she was also very proud and haughty. She had a sister, who was even more beautiful and even more proud than she was. My father's house was always full of guests, and I was often left alone with my stepmother's sister. She was very kind to me, and I loved her dearly. But one day, when I was about seven years old, she suddenly left the house and never came back. I was heartbroken, and I never saw her again. – I have often thought about her since then, and I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of her. – I have often dreamed of

1  Nathanael: One evening, when I was about eight years old, I was sitting on my father's lap and looking at a picture book. It was a book of fairy tales, and the pictures were very beautiful. I was so engrossed in the book that I didn't notice when my father fell asleep. Suddenly I heard a loud noise, and I looked up. My father was snoring loudly, and the picture book was lying open on the table. I was about to close it when I saw a strange figure standing in the doorway. It was the Sandman! He was tall and thin, with a long, pointed beard and a wide-brimmed hat. He had a pair of huge, glowing eyes, and he was holding a bag in his hand. He looked at me for a long time, and then he came closer and closer. I was terrified, and I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The Sandman opened his bag and took out a handful of sand. He threw the sand into my eyes, and I felt a burning pain. I woke up with a start, and I was lying in my bed, crying. I

1  Nathanael: I grew up and became a student at the university in Berlin. I studied hard and made many friends. But I never forgot the terrible story of the Sandman, and I often thought about him. One day, as I was walking through the city, I saw a man who looked exactly like the Sandman. He was tall and thin, with a long, pointed beard and a wide-brimmed hat. He had a pair of huge, glowing eyes, and he was carrying a bag. I followed him for a long time, but he never noticed me. I was terrified, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that the Sandman was following me. I ran home as fast as I could, and I locked myself in my room. I couldn't sleep that night, and I lay awake, listening for the sound of the Sandman's footsteps. But he never came. – I have often thought about that man since then, and I have often wondered if he was really the Sandman. – I have often thought about that man since then, and I have often wondered if he was really the Sandman. – I have often thought about

1  Nathanael: One day, when I was about twenty years old, I decided to confront the Sandman. I waited for him in my father's study, and I hid behind the door. I heard him coming up the stairs, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. He entered the room, and I stepped out from behind the door. The Sandman looked at me for a long time, and then he smiled. "Ah, you are the one who has been following me," he said. "I have been waiting for you. I have been waiting for you." I was terrified, but I tried to keep my voice steady. "Who are you?" I asked. "I am the Sandman," he replied. "I am the one who puts out the eyes of naughty children. But I have a proposition for you. I will spare your eyes if you will come with me and see my children in the half-moon." I hesitated for a moment, and then I nodded. The Sandman took my hand, and we went out into the night. We flew through the air, and I could see the stars twinkling below us.

1  Nathanael: I saw the Sandman sitting in my father's armchair, and he was holding a picture book. He looked up as I entered, and he smiled. "Ah, you are here," he said. "I have been waiting for you. I have a story to tell you. It is the story of my children. They are the children of the moon, and they live in the half-moon. They are very beautiful, but they have crooked beaks with which they peck out the eyes of naughty human children. But I have a proposition for you. I will spare your eyes if you will come with me and see my children in the half-moon." I hesitated for a moment, and then I nodded. The Sandman took my hand, and we went out into the night. We flew through the air, and I could see the stars twinkling below us. We flew over the city, and we flew over the countryside. We flew over the mountains, and we flew over the sea. And then we came to the half-moon. The Sandman opened the door, and we went inside. The children were there

1  Nathanael: I was under a spell. At the risk of being discovered and severely punished, I stood there, my head sticking out from behind the curtains, listening. My father received Coppelius solemnly. "Up! - to work," he called in a hoarse voice and threw off his coat. The father quietly and grimly took off his dressing gown, and both dressed in long black smocks. The father opened the double doors of a closet; but I saw that what I had thought was a cupboard for so long was not a cupboard, but rather a black cavity in which stood a small stove. Coppelius came over, and a blue flame crackled on the stove. They took out a large, round, black cauldron, and they began to stir it with long wooden spoons. I could see that it was full of eyes. I was horrified, and I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I was frozen with fear. I could only watch as they added more eyes to the cauldron, and I could hear the sound of children crying. I didn't know what was happening

1  Nathanael: Oh God! - when my old father now bent down to the fire, he looked quite different. A horrible, convulsive pain seemed to have twisted his gentle, honest features into an ugly devilish image. He looked like Coppelius. He swung the glowing red tongs and used them to pull brightly shining masses out of the thick smoke. It seemed to me as if human faces were becoming visible all around, but without eyes - hideous, deep black caves instead. "Eyes, eyes!" cried Coppelius in a dull, booming voice. I screamed, seized by wild terror, and rushed out of my hiding place. Then Coppelius grabbed me. "Little beast! – little beast!” he bleated, baring his teeth, and threw me onto the stove so that the flames began to singe my hair: “Now we have eyes – a beautiful pair of children’s eyes.” So whispered Coppelius, and with his fists he grabbed glowing red grains from the flames, which he wanted to sprinkle in my eyes. I struggled and fought, but I couldn't escape. I could feel

1  Nathanael: Then my father raised his hands imploringly and called out: "Master! Master! Leave my Nathanael his eyes - leave them to him!" Coppelius laughed shrilly and called out: "The boy can keep his eyes and cry his share in the world; but now we will examine the mechanism of the hands and feet properly." And with that he grabbed me so hard that the joints cracked, and unscrewed my hands and feet and put them back in now here, now there. "It's not right anywhere! It's fine the way it was! - The old man has understood it!" So hissed and lisped Coppelius; but everything around me turned black and dark, a sudden cramp shot through nerve and bone - I felt nothing anymore. I was unconscious, and I didn't know what was happening to me. I could only feel the pain in my eyes, and I could hear the sound of my father's voice, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. I was lost in a dark, endless void. I didn't know where I was, and I didn'

1  Nathanael: Why should I tire you, my dear Lothar! Why should I tell you in such detail when there is still so much left to say? Enough! – I had been discovered eavesdropping and had been mistreated by Coppelius. Fear and terror had given me a fever, which kept me ill for several weeks. “Is the Sandman still here?” – That was my first healthy word and the sign of my recovery. – I can only tell you about the most terrible moment of my youth; then you will be convinced that a dark fate really has hung a gloomy veil of clouds over my life, which I may only tear apart when I die. I have told you everything, Lothar, and I have told you the truth. I have told you about the Sandman, and I have told you about Coppelius. I have told you about the half-moon and the children of the moon. I have told you about the eyes in the cauldron, and I have told you about the pain in my eyes.

1  Nathanael: Coppelius was no longer seen; it was said that he had left town. A year may have passed when we sat at the round table in the evening according to the old custom. Then we suddenly heard the front door creak on its hinges and slow, heavy footsteps rumbled up the stairs. “That’s Coppelius,” said my mother, turning pale. “Yes! – it’s Coppelius,” repeated my father in a weak, broken voice. Tears poured from my mother’s eyes. "But father, father!" she cried, "must it be like this?" - "For the last time!" he replied, "for the last time he's coming to me, I promise you. Just go, go with the children! - Go to bed! Good night!" My mother took us children and led us to bed, and we lay there trembling with fear. I could hear the sound of Coppelius's footsteps in the hallway, and I could hear my father's voice, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. I was terrified, and I couldn't sleep. I lay

"Be quiet, be quiet, lie down in bed! - Sleep - sleep," my mother called after me; but tormented by indescribable inner fear and unrest, I could not close my eyes. It was probably already midnight when a terrible blow occurred. "That's Coppelius!" I cried in horror and jumped out of bed. Then there was a shriek of piercing, hopeless misery. I rushed to my father's room. The door was open, suffocating steam billowed out towards me. The maid cried out: "Ah, the Lord! - the Lord!" I could see my father lying on the floor, and I could see Coppelius standing over him, holding a long, sharp knife. I was terrified, and I didn't know what to do. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I was frozen with fear

1  Nathanael: My father lay dead on the floor in front of the steaming stove, his face burned black and horribly distorted. Around him, his sisters howled and whimpered - his mother was unconscious beside him! - "Coppelius, wicked Satan, you have killed your father!" - I screamed; I lost my senses. When my father was laid in the coffin two days later, his features had returned to their mild and gentle state, as they had been in life. The explosion had awakened the neighbors, the incident was reported and brought to the attention of the authorities, who wanted to summon Coppelius to account. But he had disappeared from the scene without a trace. I was left alone, with the memory of the Sandman and the terrible events that had taken place in my childhood.

He was dressed differently, but Coppelius' figure and facial features are too deeply engraved in my mind for there to be any mistake here. Moreover, Coppelius has not even changed his name. He claims to be a Piedmontese mechanic and calls himself Giuseppe Coppola. I am determined to take him on and avenge my father's death. Don't tell your mother about the appearance of the horrible monster - send my greetings to my dear, faithful Clara. Farewell, etc., etc. I have told you everything, my friend, and I have told you the truth. I have told you about the Sandman, and I have told you about Coppelius.

For you must have thought of me very vividly when you wanted to send your last letter to Brother Lothar and addressed it to me instead of to him. I opened the letter with joy and only realized my mistake when I read the words: "Ah, my dearest Lothar!" - Now I should not have read on, but given the letter to my brother. The beginning of your letter shocked me deeply. - Ah, my dearest Nathanael! What could have happened in your life that was so terrible? I was worried about you, and I wanted to write to you, but I didn't know what to say. I was afraid that you were angry with me for not writing sooner, and I didn't want to burden you with my own troubles. But now I must tell you everything, my dear Nathanael. I have been very ill, and I have been in great pain. I have been tormented by nightmares and visions, and I have

1  I read and read! - Your description of the disgusting Coppelius is horrible. Only now did I hear how your good old father died such a terrible death. Brother Lothar, to whom I delivered his property, tried to calm me down, but he was unsuccessful. The fatal barometer dealer Giuseppe Coppola followed me everywhere. But soon, the very next day, everything had changed in me. Don't be angry with me, my dearest love, that despite your strange suspicion that Coppelius will do something bad to you, I am completely cheerful and unprejudiced, as always. I am happy and content, and I want to forget the past. I want to live in the present and look forward to the future. I want to be with you, my dear Nathanael, and I want to be happy with you.

1  I will just confess to you straight out that, in my opinion, all the horrible and terrible things you speak of were only going on inside you. Old Coppelius may have been repulsive enough, but the fact that he hated children made you children really loathe him. Of course, in your childish mind, the terrible Sandman from the fairy tale was now associated with old Coppelius. The sinister goings-on with your father at night were probably nothing other than the two of them secretly conducting alchemical experiments. Your father certainly brought about his death through his own carelessness, and Coppelius is not to blame for it. I am sorry if I have caused you any distress, my dear Nathanael, but I believe that the truth will set you free. I believe that the truth will set you free.

1  Nathanael to Lothar: I am very displeased that Klara recently opened and read the letter to you by mistake. She wrote me a very profound philosophical letter in which she proves in detail that Coppelius and Coppola only exist in my inner being. In fact, one would not believe that the mind that often shines out of such bright, faithfully smiling child's eyes like a lovely, sweet dream could discuss things so intelligently, so masterfully. She is referring to you. You read her logical lectures so that she can sift through everything carefully and learn to separate things. - Stop that! I am sorry if I have caused you any distress, my dear Lothar, but I must ask you to keep my secret. I must ask you to keep my secret. I must ask you to keep my secret.

1  Incidentally, it is quite certain that the barometer seller Giuseppe Coppola is by no means the old lawyer Coppelius. I am attending lectures by the recently arrived professor of physics, whose name is Spallanzani and who is of Italian descent. He has known Coppola for many years, and you can also tell from his accent that he really is from Piedmont. Coppelius was a German. I am not entirely reassured. You and Klara may think I am a gloomy dreamer, but I cannot shake the impression that Coppelius's accursed face makes on me. I am glad that he is out of town, as Spallanzani tells me.

1  - Recently I climbed the stairs and noticed that the curtain that is usually drawn tightly across a glass door had a small gap at the side. I do not know how I came to look through it curiously. A tall, very slim, perfectly symmetrical, beautifully dressed woman was sitting in the room in front of a small table on which she had placed both arms, her hands folded together. She was sitting opposite the door, so that I could see her angelic face in full. She did not seem to notice me, and her eyes were fixed, I would almost say she had no vision, it seemed to me as if she were sleeping with her eyes open. I felt quite uneasy, so I crept quietly away into the auditorium next door. I was afraid to go back, but I couldn't help myself. I went back to the door and looked through the gap again. The woman was still sitting there, as if she had not moved an inch. I felt a strange, inexplicable fear, and I ran down the stairs as fast as I could. I did not know what it was that had frightened me so, but I knew that I had seen something

I could have told you better and in more detail in person. Know that I will be with you for over a fortnight. I must see my sweet, dear angel, my Klara, again. Then the bad mood that was trying to take hold of me will be gone. A thousand greetings, etc., etc. I have told you everything, my dear Lothar, and I have told you the truth.

1  Nothing can be invented more strange and wonderful than what happened to my poor friend, the young student Nathanael, and what I have undertaken to tell you, dear reader! In order to make clearer what needs to be known at the beginning, it should be added to those letters that soon after Nathanael's father died, Clara and Lothar, children of a distant relative who had also died and left them orphaned, were taken into the house by Nathanael's mother. Clara and Nathanael developed a strong affection for each other; they were therefore engaged when Nathanael left the place to continue his studies in G. There he is now, attending lectures by the famous professor of physics, Spallanzani. I have told you everything, my dear reader, and I have told you the truth. I have told you about the Sandman, and I have told you about Coppelius. I have told you about the half-moon and the children of the moon.

1  Now I could confidently continue with the story; but at this moment the image of Clara is so vivid before my eyes that I cannot look away. The mistaker and the hoverer played a nasty trick on her; for without saying too much, which was not in Clara's taciturn nature, her bright gaze and that subtle ironic smile said to them: Dear friends! How can you expect me to regard your fleeting shadows as real figures? For this reason, Clara was scolded by many as being cold, unfeeling, and prosaic; but others loved the intelligent girl immensely, but none more than Nathanael. Clara was attached to her lover with all her heart. With what delight she flew into his arms when he now, as he had promised in his last letter to Lothar, actually entered her mother's room in his hometown. It happened just as Nathanael had believed; When he saw Clara again, he thought neither of the lawyer Coppelius nor of Clara's sensible letter; all his resentment had disappeared. I am glad that he is happy, my dear reader, and I am glad that

1  But Nathanael was right when he wrote to his friend Lothar that the repulsive figure of Coppola had entered his life in a very hostile way. Everyone felt this, because Nathanael's whole being had changed completely in the first few days. He always spoke of how every person, believing themselves to be free, only serves as a cruel game for dark powers. He used to have a particular strength in charming, lively stories, which he wrote down and which Clara listened to with the deepest pleasure; now his poems were dark, incomprehensible, shapeless, so that, even if Clara did not say it out of consideration, he certainly felt how little they appealed to her. His annoyance with Clara's cold, prosaic nature grew stronger, Clara could not overcome her displeasure with Nathanael's dark, gloomy, boring mysticism, and so both of them grew further and further apart. I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader

1  The figure of the ugly Coppelius had, as Nathanael had to admit, paled in his imagination, and it often cost him effort to paint him quite vividly in his poems. Finally it occurred to him to make the dark premonition that Coppelius would spoil his happiness in love the subject of a poem. He depicted himself and Clara, united in faithful love, but now and then it was as if a black fist reached into their lives and tore away some joy. Finally, when they were already standing at the altar, the terrible Coppelius appeared and touched Clara's lovely eyes; they leap into Nathanael's chest like bloody sparks, Coppelius grabs him and throws him into a flaming circle of fire that spins and carries him away with a roar. But through this wild roar he hears Clara's voice: "Can't you see me? Coppelius has deceived you, those weren't my eyes - I have my eyes, just look at me!" Nathanael looks into Clara's eyes; but it is Death who looks at him kindly with Clara'

Soon, however, the whole thing seemed to him to be just a very successful poem, and it seemed to him as if it would ignite Clara's cold mind.

1  They, Nathanael and Clara, were sitting in their mother's little garden. Clara was very cheerful because Nathanael had not tormented her with his dreams and premonitions for the three days in which he had been writing that poem. Nathanael too spoke animatedly and happily of funny things as usual, so that Clara said: "Now I have you completely back. Do you see how we have driven away the ugly Coppelius?" Then Nathanael remembered that he had the poem in his pocket that he had wanted to read aloud. He immediately pulled out the pages and began to read. Clara, suspecting something boring as usual and resigning herself to it, began to knit quietly.

He was irresistibly drawn away by his poetry, his inner fire colored his cheeks bright red, tears welled up from his eyes. - Finally he had closed his eyes, he groaned in deep exhaustion: "Ah! - Klara - Klara!" - Klara pressed him gently to her breast and said quietly but very seriously: "Nathanael - my dear Nathanael! - throw the crazy - nonsensical - insane fairy tale into the fire." Then Nathanael jumped up indignantly and shouted, pushing Klara away: "You lifeless, damned automaton!" He ran away, the deeply hurt Klara shed bitter tears: "Ah, he never loved me, because he doesn't understand me," she sobbed loudly. I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them,

1  Lothar went into the arbor; Klara had to tell him what had happened; every word of her accusation fell like a spark into his heart, so that the resentment he had long harbored against the dreamy Nathanael flared up into wild anger. He ran to Nathanael and reproached him for his senseless behavior towards his beloved sister in harsh words, which the quick-tempered Nathanael responded in kind. A duel was inevitable. They decided to fight behind the garden the following morning with sharp rapiers. I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader.

1  Klara had heard the fierce argument and seen that the fencing master brought the swords at dusk. She suspected what was about to happen. When they arrived at the battlefield, Lothar and Nathanael had just thrown off their coats in gloomy silence; with bloodthirsty fighting spirit in their burning eyes, they were about to attack each other when Klara rushed through the garden gate. Sobbing, she cried out loudly: "You wild, horrible people! - just knock me down now before you attack each other; for how can I live any longer in this world if the beloved has murdered the brother or the brother the beloved!" I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader.

1  Lothar lowered his weapon and looked down at the ground in silence, but in Nathanael's heart all the love he had ever felt for the lovely Clara was rekindled in heart-rending melancholy. The murder weapon fell from his hand and he fell at Clara's feet. "Can you ever forgive me, my only, dearly beloved Clara! - Can you forgive me, my dearly beloved brother Lothar!" - Lothar was moved by his friend's deep pain; with a thousand tears the three reconciled people embraced each other and swore not to leave each other in constant love and loyalty. I am glad for them, my dear reader, and I am glad for them, my dear reader, and I am glad for them, my dear reader. I am glad for them, my dear reader. I am glad for them, my dear reader.

1  Nathanael felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted from him. He spent three more blissful days with his loved ones, then he returned to G., where he planned to stay for another year, but then return to his hometown forever. Nathanael was astonished when he went to his apartment and saw that the whole house had burned down. Although the fire had broken out in the laboratory of the pharmacist who lived on the lower floor, and the house had therefore burned from the bottom up, the bold, robust friends had managed to get into Nathanael's room on the upper floor in time and save books, manuscripts and instruments. They had carried everything unharmed to another house and taken over a room there, which Nathanael immediately moved into. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  He paid no particular attention to the fact that he lived opposite Professor Spallanzani, and it seemed no more unusual to him when he noticed that from his window he could see straight into the room where Olimpia often sat alone, so that he could see her figure clearly, although her features remained indistinct and confused. He did notice that Olimpia often sat for hours at a small table in the same position, doing nothing, and that she was obviously staring at him with an unblinking gaze; he had to admit to himself that he had never seen a more beautiful figure; however, Clara in his heart, the stiff, rigid Olimpia remained utterly indifferent to him. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  He was just writing to Klara when there was a soft knock on the door; it opened at his call, and Coppola's repulsive face looked in. Nathanael felt a trembling inside; remembering what Spallanzani had said to him about his countryman Coppola, and what he had so solemnly promised his beloved about Coppelius the Sandman, he was ashamed of his childish fear of ghosts, pulled himself together with all his might, and said as gently and calmly as possible: "I'm not buying a barometer, my dear friend! Just go!" But Coppola stepped into the room and said in a hoarse tone: "Oh, no barometer! - I've got a nice eye too - a nice eye!" Nathanael cried out in horror: "You madman, how can you have eyes? – Eyes – eyes?” I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him,

1  But at that moment Coppola had put his barometer aside, reached into his wide coat pockets and pulled out glasses, which he laid on the table. – “Now – now – glasses – glasses on your nose, put them on my eyes, those are my eyes – beautiful eyes!” – And with that he pulled out more and more glasses, so that the whole table began to flicker and sparkle strangely. A thousand eyes looked and twitched convulsively and stared up at Nathanael; but he could not look away from the table, and fiery glances jumped more and more wildly and shot their blood-red rays into Nathanael’s chest. Overcome by mad terror, he cried out: – “Stop, you horrible man!” – He had grabbed Coppola firmly by the arm, who was just reaching into his pocket to pull out more glasses. I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  Coppola gently freed himself with a hoarse laugh and with the words: “Ah! - nothing for you - but here are some nice glasses" - he had put all his glasses away and taken a number of large and small perspective glasses out of the side pocket of his coat. As soon as the glasses were gone, Nathanael became very calm and, thinking of Klara, he realized that the horrible ghost could only have come from within him and that Coppola could be a very honest mechanic and optician and by no means Coppelius's accursed double. To make up for everything, Nathanael decided to buy something from Coppola. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  He picked up a small, very neatly made pocket perspective glass and looked through the window to examine it. Never in his life had he seen a glass that brought objects so cleanly, sharply and clearly close to his eyes. Involuntarily he looked into Spallanzani's room; Olimpia was sitting, as usual, in front of the small table. - Now Nathanael saw Olimpia's beautifully formed face for the first time. Only the eyes seemed strangely rigid and dead. But as he looked ever more closely through the glass, it was as if moist moonlight appeared in Olimpia's eyes. Nathanael lay in the window as if by magic, always looking at the heavenly-beautiful Olimpia. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  A clearing of the throat and scratching woke him as if from a deep dream. Coppola was standing behind him: "Tre Zechini - three ducats." - Nathanael had completely forgotten about the optician, and quickly paid what was asked. "Adieu, dear friend!" - Coppola left the room, not without many strange sidelong glances at Nathanael. He heard him laughing loudly on the stairs. "Well," said Nathanael, "he's laughing at me because I've certainly paid him far too much for the little perspective!" - As he spoke these words quietly, it was as if a deep sigh of death echoed horribly through the room, Nathanael's breath caught in inner fear. I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  But he had sighed like that himself, he noticed that. "Klara," he said to himself, "is probably right to think I'm a tasteless ghost-seer." - Now he sat down to finish the letter to Klara, but a glance through the window convinced him that Olimpia was still sitting there, and in an instant, as if driven by an irresistible force, he jumped up, grabbed Coppola's perspective and could not tear himself away from Olimpia's seductive sight until his friend and brother Siegmund called him away to the lecture given by Professor Spallanzani. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  When he was about to return to his apartment, he noticed a noisy commotion in Spallanzani's house. The doors were open, all kinds of equipment was being brought in, busy maids were sweeping, and inside carpenters and upholsterers were knocking and hammering. Nathanael stopped in the street in complete amazement; then Siegmund came up to him laughing and said: "Well, what do you say about our old Spallanzani?" Nathanael assured him that he could not say anything, since he knew absolutely nothing about the professor; then he learned from Siegmund that Spallanzani was going to give a big party the next day, a concert and a ball, and that half the university was invited. It was widely known that Spallanzani was going to have his daughter Olimpia appear for the first time. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for

1  Nathanael found an invitation card and went to the professor at the appointed hour with his heart pounding. The company was large and brilliant. Olimpia appeared very richly and tastefully dressed. One had to admire her beautifully formed face and her stature. The somewhat oddly bent back and the wasp-like thinness of her body seemed to have been caused by too much constriction. There was something measured and stiff about her step and posture that struck some as unpleasant; they attributed this to the constraints imposed on her by the company. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  The concert began. Olimpia played the piano with great skill and also performed a bravura aria in a clear, glass-bell voice. Nathanael was quite delighted; he was standing in the back row and could not quite make out Olimpia's features. So, quite unnoticed, he took out Coppola's glass and looked at the beautiful Olimpia. Ah! – then he noticed how she looked at him full of longing, how every note was clearly expressed in the loving look that ignited his inner being. The artificial embellishments seemed to Nathanael the heavenly exultation of a soul transfigured by love, and when finally, after the cadence, the long trill rang out loudly through the hall, he could no longer contain himself, he had to cry out loudly in pain and delight: “Olimpia!” – Everyone looked around at him, some laughed. The cathedral organist, however, pulled an even darker face than before and simply said: “Now, now!” I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and

1  The concert was over, the ball began. To dance with her! – with her! that was now the goal of all Nathanael’s wishes. He himself did not know how it happened that, when the dance had already begun, he stood close to Olimpia, who had not yet been asked, and took her hand. Olimpia's hand was ice cold, he felt himself trembling with a terrible chill of death, he stared into Olimpia's eyes, which shone at him full of love and longing, and at that moment it was as if pulses began to beat in the cold hand and streams of life's blood began to glow. And Nathanael's inner being also glowed with love, he embraced the beautiful Olimpia and flew through the rows with her. I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  Heated up by the dance and the copious amounts of wine he had consumed, Nathanael had cast off all his usual shyness. He sat next to Olimpia, her hand in his, and spoke passionately of his love in words that no one understood, neither he nor Olimpia. But perhaps she did, for she looked him straight in the eye and sighed over and over again: "Ah - ah - ah!" - whereupon Nathanael said: "Oh, you glorious, heavenly woman! - you ray from the promised beyond of love," and more of the same. But Olimpia just kept sighing: "Ah, ah!" I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  Professor Spallanzani walked past the happy couple a few times and smiled at them with strange contentment. Nathanael suddenly felt as if things were getting noticeably dark at Professor Spallanzani's; he looked around and noticed, to his considerable horror, that the last two lights in the empty hall were about to go out. "Separation, separation," he screamed wildly and desperately, he kissed Olimpia's hand, he leaned towards her mouth, ice-cold lips met his glowing ones! - Just as when he touched Olimpia's cold hand, he felt an inner horror, the legend of the dead bride suddenly flashed through his mind; but Olimpia had pressed him tightly to her, and in the kiss her lips seemed to warm to life. I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  "Do you love me - do you love me, Olimpia? - Just this word! - Do you love me?" So whispered Nathanael, but Olimpia sighed as she stood up, only: "Ah - ah!" - "Yes, you, my lovely, glorious star of love," said Nathanael, "have risen for me and will shine, will transfigure my inner being forever!" - "Ah, ah!" replied Olimpia, striding forward. Nathanael followed her, and they stood in front of the professor. "You have had an extraordinarily lively conversation with my daughter," said the professor, smiling, "well, dear Mr. Nathanael, if you find it enjoyable to talk to the shy girl, then your visits shall be welcome." - With a whole bright, radiant sky in his chest, Nathanael left. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I

Nathanael wanted to explode angrily, but quickly came to his senses and replied: "Tell me, Siegmund, how your gaze, which normally clearly perceives everything beautiful, could have missed the heavenly charm of Olimpia?" Siegmund noticed how things stood with his friend, skilfully relented and added: "It is strange that many of us judge Olimpia in much the same way. Olimpia has become quite uncanny to us, we didn't want to have anything to do with her, it seemed to us as if she was just acting like a living being." Nathanael simply said very seriously: "Olimpia may well be uncanny to you, you cold, prosaic people. Only the poetic mind unfolds the equally organized! But you have no understanding of all that, and all of it is wasted words.” I am glad for him, my dear reader,

1  Professor Spallanzani seemed delighted with his daughter’s relationship with Nathanael; he gave him all sorts of unambiguous signs of his goodwill, and when Nathanael finally dared to hint at a relationship with Olimpia, the latter smiled with his whole face and said that he would give his daughter complete freedom of choice. – Encouraged by these words, Nathanael decided to implore Olimpia the very next day to say frankly in clear words what her lovely loving look had long since told him, that she wanted to be his forever. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  Already on the stairs, in the hallway, he heard a strange noise; it seemed to be coming from Spallanzani’s study. – A stamping – a clatter – a pushing – banging against the door, interspersed with curses and imprecations. “Let go – let go – infamous – wicked man! – Is that why you risked your life and limb? – ha, ha, ha! – we didn’t wager like that – I, I made the eyes – I the clockwork – stupid devil with your clockwork – cursed dog of a simple watchmaker – get away with you – Satan – stop – puppet-maker – devilish beast! – stop – go – let go!” – It was Spallanzani’s and the horrible Coppelius’ voices that were buzzing together.

1  Nathanael rushed in, seized by nameless fear. The professor had grabbed a female figure by the shoulders, the Italian Coppola by the feet, and they were pulling and tugging them back and forth, fighting in full fury for possession. Nathanael recoiled in utter horror when he recognized the figure as Olimpia; Flaring up in wild anger, he wanted to snatch his beloved from the angry men, but at that moment Coppola, turning with enormous strength, wrested the figure from the professor's hands and dealt him a terrible blow with the figure itself, causing him to stagger backwards over the table on which there were phials, retorts, bottles and glass cylinders, and fall to the ground; all the equipment shattered into a thousand pieces. I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  Then Coppola threw the figure over his shoulder and ran quickly down the stairs with a horrible, piercing laughter. Nathanael stood frozen – he had seen only too clearly that Olimpia's deathly pale wax face had no eyes, but black sockets instead; she was a lifeless doll. Spallanzani rolled on the ground, shards of glass had cut his head, chest and arm, blood was pouring out like a fountain. But he gathered his strength. – “Follow him – follow him, why are you hesitating? – Coppelius – Coppelius, he stole my best machine from me – worked on it for twenty years – risked his life and limb – the gears – language – movement – ​​mine – the eyes – the eyes stolen from you. – Damned – accursed – follow him – get me Olimpia – there are the eyes!” I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  He would have strangled him, but the noise had attracted many people who forced their way in, tore the enraged Nathanael to his feet and saved the professor. Siegmund, strong as he was, could not control the madman; he kept screaming in a terrible voice: "Wooden doll, turn around," and struck around with clenched fists. Finally, the combined strength of several people managed to overpower him. His words were drowned out by a terrible, animalistic roar. Raging in this horrific frenzy, he was taken to the madhouse.

Klara had bent over him, and his mother and Lothar stood not far away. "Finally, finally, oh my dearest Nathanael - now you have recovered from a serious illness - now you are mine again!"
- Thus spoke Klara from the bottom of her heart and took Nathanael in her arms. But bright, glowing tears welled up from his eyes out of sheer sadness and delight, and he groaned deeply. "My Klara!" - Siegmund, who had faithfully stood by his friend in great need, came in. Nathanael held out his hand to him: "You faithful brother, you have not abandoned me after all."

1  Every trace of madness had disappeared, and Nathanael soon regained strength in the careful care of his mother, his lover, and his friends. In the meantime, happiness had returned to the house; for an old, penniless uncle, from whom no one had hoped for anything, had died and had left his mother, along with a not inconsiderable fortune, a small estate in a pleasant area not far from the city. They wanted to go there: the mother, Nathanael with his Clara, whom he now intended to marry, and Lothar.

1  It was time for the four happy people to go to the estate. At midday they walked through the streets of the town. They had bought a lot of things, the high town hall tower cast its gigantic shadow over the market. "Well!" said Clara, "let's climb up again and look into the distant mountains!" No sooner said than done! Both Nathanael and Clara climbed up, the mother went home with the maid, and Lothar, not inclined to climb the many steps, wanted to wait below. Then the two lovers stood arm in arm on the highest gallery of the tower and looked into the fragrant forests, behind which the blue mountains rose like a giant city.

Nathanael mechanically reached for his side pocket; he found Coppola's perspective, he looked sideways - Klara was standing in front of the glass! - Then his veins twitched convulsively - deathly pale he stared at Klara, but soon streams of fire glowed and sprayed through his rolling eyes, he roared horribly like a hunted animal; then he leapt high into the air, and laughing horribly in between, he screamed in a piercing tone: "Wooden doll, turn around - wooden doll, turn around" - and with tremendous strength he grabbed Klara and wanted to hurl her down, but Klara clung tightly to the railing in desperate fear of death.

1  Lothar heard the madman raging, he heard Klara's screams of fear, a terrible premonition ran through him, he ran upstairs, the door of the second flight of stairs was locked - Klara's cries of distress echoed louder. Mad with rage and fear, he pushed against the door, which finally burst open. – Klara's cries became fainter and fainter: "Help – save – save –" the voice died away in the air. "She's gone – murdered by the madman," Lothar screamed. The door to the gallery was also slammed shut. – Despair gave him enormous strength, he burst the door off its hinges. – God in heaven – Klara, seized by the madman Nathanael, was floating in the air above the gallery – she was only still clutching the iron bars with one hand. I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my

1  Quick as lightning, Lothar seized his sister, pulled her inside and at the same moment struck the madman in the face with his clenched fist, causing him to recoil and let go of his deadly prey. Lothar ran down, his unconscious sister in his arms. – She was saved. I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader, and I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader. I am glad for him, my dear reader.

1  Now Nathanael raced around the gallery and jumped high into the air and shouted: "Circle of fire, turn around - circle of fire, turn around." The people ran together at the wild shouting; among them towered the lawyer Coppelius, who had just come into the city and was walking straight to the market. They wanted to climb up to seize the madman, but Coppelius laughed, saying: "Ha, ha - just wait, he'll come down of his own accord," and looked up like the others. I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader, and I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader. I am sorry for them, my dear reader.

1  Nathanael suddenly stood there as if frozen, he bent down, saw Coppelius, and with a piercing cry: "Ha! Sköne Oke - sköne Oke" he jumped over the railing. When Nathanael lay on the cobblestones with his head shattered, Coppelius had disappeared in the crowd. I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader, and I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader. I am sorry for him, my dear reader.

1  Several years later, Clara was said to have been seen in a distant region, sitting hand in hand with a friendly man in front of the door of a beautiful country house, with two lively boys playing in front of her. It would be concluded from this that Clara still found the quiet domestic happiness that suited her cheerful, fun-loving spirit and that Nathanael, who was torn inside, could never have granted her. I am glad for her, my dear reader, and I am glad for her, my dear reader, and I am glad for her, my dear reader. I am glad for her, my dear reader. I am glad for her, my dear reader.
