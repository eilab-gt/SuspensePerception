They wanted to climb up to seize the madman, but Coppelius laughed, saying: "Ha, ha - just wait, he'll come down of his own accord," and looked up like the others.

My rating: 1/10. This paragraph is not suspenseful as it does not contain any elements that would increase the sense of fear or tension for the reader. The focus is on Clara's future and her happiness, which is a positive and
