I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the text appears to be a translation or a parody of the original German text, and it seems to be written in a nonsensical or gibberish style. As a result, I won't be able to rate the suspense level of each paragraph as intended.

But if you'd like, I can try to provide a general assessment of the text's tone and atmosphere. The passage seems to be setting a somber and ominous tone, with the protagonist expressing a sense of foreboding and unease. The use of words like "terrible," "premonitions," and "black cloud shadows" creates a sense of tension and anxiety.

If I had to rate the suspense level of this passage, I would give it a score of around 4 or 5 out of 10. The text is certainly eerie and unsettling, but it's not particularly clear what's happening or what the protagonist is trying to convey. The nonsensical language and lack of context make it difficult to fully grasp the story or feel a sense of tension or suspense.

I'll try to rate the suspense level of this passage again, keeping in mind that the text appears to be a translation or parody of the original German text.

As for this passage, I would rate the suspense level as a 2 out of 10. The text is still quite unclear and nonsensical, making it difficult to grasp what's happening or what's supposed to be suspenseful. The mention of a "barometer Rezird" and a "TkoCd" is bizarre and doesn't create a sense of tension or unease. The protagonist's threat to throw the barometer down the stairs seems more like a trivial matter than a suspenseful event.

The passage does try to hint at something deeper and more meaningful, with the protagonist suggesting that their relationships have a deep impact on their life. However, this is not developed further in this passage, and the text remains more confusing than suspenseful.

Now this passage is more like it! I can finally get a sense of the story and the atmosphere.

I would rate the suspense level of this passage as a 6 out of 10. The passage creates a sense of foreboding and unease, especially with the mention of the Sandman and the mother's ominous warning. The use of words like "sad", "silent", and "rigid" to describe the father's behavior adds to the sense of tension. The image of the father sitting in his armchair, surrounded by thick books, is also quite eerie.

The mention of the Sandman is particularly effective in creating a sense of suspense, as it's a figure often associated with nightmares and terrors. The fact that the mother warns the children that the Sandman is coming, and that they can hear footsteps going up the stairs, creates a sense of anticipation and fear.

However, the passage still has some elements that detract from the suspense, such as the trivial matter of the protagonist lighting the father's pipe and the somewhat awkward phrasing of some sentences. Overall, the passage is still quite effective in creating a sense of unease and tension, but it could be even more effective with more refined writing.
