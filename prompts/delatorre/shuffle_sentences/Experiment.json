One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. \u201cBy the time we get there and wait for it to come, it\u2019ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.\u201d His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand. It wasn\u2019t a particularly interesting job. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope.", "2 However, the service stairwell wasn\u2019t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building\u2019s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean.", "3 Everything depended on the metabolic rate. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn\u2019t bother to position the \u201dwet floor\u201d warning signs at the top of each section.", "4 Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn\u2019t moved. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. This is the story of what happened. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis.", "5 He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child\u2019s life been hanging in the balance. If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. He felt decidedly nervous. Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell.", "6 Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag.", "7 That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of colour on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. Overall, it was an agreeable job. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn\u2019t stay upright. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger.", "8 The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital\u2019s eight floors. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. The other shouted something inaudible. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital\u2019s secondary corridors. However, the doctors were soon there. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube.", "9 However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. It\u2019s best to call the doctors.\u201d The other nodded, pulling back his hand. Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d warned his colleague, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been damaged. His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle.", "10 He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. It\u2019s not worth taking the lift,\u201d he said, realising his colleague\u2019s intention. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Realizing that he hadn\u2019t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d continued the first. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. \u201cMove away, please,\u201d asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. \u201cYou stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.\u201d Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well.", "11 \u201cThe patient is on the 6th floor. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley and continued his typical working day. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit.", "12 At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition."]]]}
