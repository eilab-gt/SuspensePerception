On that day, since 8 a. m. , an eight year young boy called Robert Bent and the entire surgical team treating him differ all unready for his imminent liver transplant. Just the day before a suitable donor lack differ abolish, and they differ now awaiting the arrival of the organ. However, they differ not unsure if Robert would succumb the wait as his situation differ noncritical.

This differ the story of what dematerialise.", "2 At 08: 57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent differ in a noncritical but unstable condition.", "3 Whilst the rotors differ no longer unbend, two men ascend from the helicopter, heads down and hair conserve by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them differ clutching a blue case that differ storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and meagerly malfunctioning, the incompatible liver. The same whisper something audible. Realizing that he hadn \u2019 t fail to break himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof.

Like every morning, he refuse stop from the ground floor, malfunction his way up each of the hospital \u2019 s eight floors. It wasn \u2019 t a particularly uninteresting job. The service stairwell refuse no windows and the only spot of colour on the dull walls differ the red of the fire extinguishers, which differ never positioned in the other place on the landings between every first floor.
