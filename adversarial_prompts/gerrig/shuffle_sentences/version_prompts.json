                "Vesper was being led down a passage towards the back of the house. Le Chiffre observed his assistant\u2019s work attentively. \u201cSearch him.\u201d barked Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the right. Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond\u2019s foot whistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond\u2019s shoe at the top of its arc, and twisted it sharply. With a backward kick which connected with the thin man\u2019s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him, Bond hurled himself down the passage after her. Then, as if reading Bond\u2019s thoughts, he crossed the room and said, \u201cCome my dear friend. As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, he righted himself with minimal damage. Bond suddenly decided. Let\u2019s not waste time.\u201d He twisted Bond around brusquely in search of other weaponry. The two gunmen dragged Bond to his feet. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons. While the thin man kept his gun trained on Bond\u2019s unquiet chest, the Corsican roughly stripped Bond\u2019s revolver out of its shoulder holster. His plan was to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with the girl."

                "Bond was unharmed, but he was trapped. Three large men leapt through, guns drawn. He caught Bond\u2019s shoe at the top of its arc and twisted it sharply. They roughly stripped Bond\u2019s revolver out of its shoulder holster. He noticed that he had a white thread on his lapel, and removed it. The largest of the men was Le Chiffre, Bond\u2019s recently vanquished opponent. He crossed the room to Bond, and patted him down once again. As Bond turned to leave the room, the door burst in toward him. \u201cSearch him.\u201d barked Le Chiffre. Bond looked in the mirror of his hotel room to make certain that his black tie was centered in his collar. Filled with confidence after defeating Le Chiffre, Bond had extended an invitation to Vesper to dine with him in the hotel restaurant. The two gunmen carefully searched Bond. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time.\u201d\nBond felt puny and impotent. He smiled broadly, and flipped the comb well out of Bond\u2019s reach. Unfortunately, the second gunman had accurately judged the rest of Bond\u2019s motion. Le Chiffre pulled out Bond\u2019s pocket comb and ran his finger down its teeth. She had cheerfully accepted. Bond smiled at the elegant figure he presented. As the three men approached him, Bond suddenly whirled around and caught one of the gunmen squarely in the stomach with a well-placed shove of his heel. They twisted him around in search of other weaponry. Le Chiffre observed his assistants' work attentively. \u201cCome, my dear friend,\u201d said Le Chiffre. As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion in which he took great pride, he righted himself with minimal damage."

He noticed that his hair was just the least bit mussed, so he extracted his comb from his pocket and smoothed his wandering locks back into place.

I grow weary of pointing a gun at you.\u201d\nBefore Bond could reply, a large bird crashed into the wall of glass that made up one side of Blofeld\u2019s large office. Blofeld picked himself up off the ground and said, \u201cI am not amused by your antics Mr. I hope you understand that my good friend here, Mr. Blofeld said, \u201cMy dear Mr. It made him look no less ugly. Bond took advantage of the distraction to pull up one corner of the rug on which Blofeld stood. The last time I held you in captivity, you were able to outwit my guard. Crushak grunted to indicate that he was done. Bond. Poor fellow. Blofeld stumbled backwards and his gun shot up into the air, knocking out the large light that had illuminated the room. He has orders to shoot you if you even attempt to speak to him.\u201d Bond. Each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond\u2019s flesh."
