            "Unused Comb",
            "Filled with confidence after defeating Le Chiffre, Bond had extended an invitation to Vesper to dine with him in the hotel restaurant. She had cheerfully accepted.\nBond looked in the mirror of his hotel room to make certain that his black tie was centered in his collar. He noticed that he had a white thread on his lapel, and removed it. Bond smiled at the elegant figure he presented.\nAs Bond turned to leave the room, the door burst in toward him. Three large men leapt through, guns drawn. The largest of the men was Le Chiffre, Bond\u2019s recently vanquished opponent.\nAs the three men approached him, Bond suddenly whirled around and caught one of the gunmen squarely in the stomach with a well-placed shove of his heel. Unfortunately, the second gunman had accurately judged the rest of Bond\u2019s motion. He caught Bond\u2019s shoe at the top of its arc and twisted it sharply. As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion in which he took great pride, he righted himself with minimal damage. Bond was unharmed, but he was trapped.\n\u201cSearch him.\u201d barked Le Chiffre.\nThe two gunmen carefully searched Bond. They roughly stripped Bond\u2019s revolver out of its shoulder holster. They twisted him around in search of other weaponry.\nLe Chiffre observed his assistants' work attentively. He crossed the room to Bond, and patted him down once again. Le Chiffre pulled out Bond\u2019s pocket comb and ran his finger down its teeth. He smiled broadly, and flipped the comb well out of Bond\u2019s reach. \u201cCome, my dear friend,\u201d said Le Chiffre. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time.\u201d\nBond felt puny and impotent."

            "Blofeld smiled and said, \u201cWe must stop meeting like this Mr. Bond. I grow weary of pointing a gun at you.\u201d\nBefore Bond could reply, a large bird crashed into the wall of glass that made up one side of Blofeld\u2019s large office. Bond took advantage of the distraction to pull up one corner of the rug on which Blofeld stood. Blofeld stumbled backwards and his gun shot up into the air, knocking out the large light that had illuminated the room.\nAs Bond\u2019s eyes grew accustomed to the dark of the office, he hurried toward the door. He was met there, however, by a very large and very ugly man. Light from the hall spilled in, revealing another gun pointing at his chest.\nBlofeld picked himself up off the ground and said, \u201cI am not amused by your antics Mr. Bond. I hope you understand that my good friend here, Mr. Crushak, is devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life.\u201d At this, the large man contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile. It made him look no less ugly. Blofeld continued, \u201cTie up Mr. Bond.\u201d\nCrushak forced Bond into a wooden arm chair and carefully pinned Bond in place by wrapping a piece of piano wire around each of the chair\u2019s corners and Bond\u2019s arms. Each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Bond\u2019s flesh.\nCrushak grunted to indicate that he was done. Blofeld said, \u201cMy dear Mr. Bond. The last time I held you in captivity, you were able to outwit my guard. He died soon after that in an automobile accident. Poor fellow. Crushak here will be responsible for you this time. He has orders to shoot you if you even attempt to speak to him.\u201d"
