Bond took advantage of the distraction to pull up one corner of the rug on which Blofeld stood. Blofeld stumbled backwards and his gun shot up into the air, knocking out the large light that had illuminated the room.\nAs Bond\u2019s eyes grew accustomed to the dark of the office, he hurried toward the door. He was met there, however, by a very large and very ugly man. Light from the hall spilled in, revealing another gun pointing at his chest.\nBlofeld picked himself up off the ground and said, \u201cI am not amused by your antics Mr. Bond. I hope you understand that my good friend here, Mr. Crushak, is devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life.\u201d At this, the large man contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile.
