                "Alex was standing in the doorway of a room on the right. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons.\nAlex was being led down a passage towards the back of the house. Bond suddenly decided. With a backward kick which connected with the thin man\u2019s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him, Bond hurled himself down the passage after her. His plan was to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with the girl.\nLike lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond\u2019s foot whistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond\u2019s shoe at the top of its arc, and twisted it sharply. As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, he righted himself with minimal damage.\n\u201cSearch him.\u201d barked Alex.\nThe two gunmen dragged Bond to his feet. While the thin man kept his gun trained on Bond\u2019s unquiet chest, the Corsican roughly stripped Bond\u2019s revolver out of its shoulder holster. He twisted Bond around brusquely in search of other weaponry. Alex observed his assistant\u2019s work attentively. Then, as if reading Bond\u2019s thoughts, he crossed the room and said, \u201cCome my dear friend. Let\u2019s not waste time.\u201d"

                "Filled with confidence after defeating Alex, Bond had extended an invitation to Vesper to dine with him in the hotel restaurant. She had cheerfully accepted.\nBond looked in the mirror of his hotel room to make certain that his black tie was centered in his collar. He noticed that he had a white thread on his lapel, and removed it. Bond smiled at the elegant figure he presented.\nAs Bond turned to leave the room, the door burst in toward him. Three large men leapt through, guns drawn. The largest of the men was Alex, Bond\u2019s recently vanquished opponent.\nAs the three men approached him, Bond suddenly whirled around and caught one of the gunmen squarely in the stomach with a well-placed shove of his heel. Unfortunately, the second gunman had accurately judged the rest of Bond\u2019s motion. He caught Bond\u2019s shoe at the top of its arc and twisted it sharply. As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion in which he took great pride, he righted himself with minimal damage. Bond was unharmed, but he was trapped.\n\u201cSearch him.\u201d barked Alex.\nThe two gunmen carefully searched Bond. They roughly stripped Bond\u2019s revolver out of its shoulder holster. They twisted him around in search of other weaponry.\nAlex observed his assistants' work attentively. He crossed the room to Bond, and patted him down once again. Alex pulled out Bond\u2019s pocket comb and ran his finger down its teeth. He smiled broadly, and flipped the comb well out of Bond\u2019s reach. \u201cCome, my dear friend,\u201d said Alex. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time.\u201d\nBond felt puny and impotent."

Riley stumbled backwards and his gun shot up into the air, knocking out the large light that had illuminated the room.\nAs Alex\u2019s eyes grew accustomed to the dark of the office, he hurried toward the door. He was met there, however, by a very large and very ugly man. Light from the hall spilled in, revealing another gun pointing at his chest.\nRiley picked himself up off the ground and said, \u201cI am not amused by your antics Mr. Alex. I hope you understand that my good friend here, Mr. Morgan, is devoted to eliminating such irritations from my life.\u201d At this, the large man contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile. It made him look no less ugly. Riley continued, \u201cTie up Mr. Alex.\u201d\nMorgan forced Alex into a wooden arm chair and carefully pinned Alex in place by wrapping a piece of piano wire around each of the chair\u2019s corners and Alex\u2019s arms. Each subsequent twist of the wire bit more painfully into Alex\u2019s flesh.\nMorgan grunted to indicate that he was done. Riley said, \u201cMy dear Mr. Alex. The last time I held you in captivity, you were able to outwit my guard. He died soon after that in an automobile accident. Poor fellow. Morgan here will be responsible for you this time. He has orders to shoot you if you even attempt to speak to him.\u201d"
