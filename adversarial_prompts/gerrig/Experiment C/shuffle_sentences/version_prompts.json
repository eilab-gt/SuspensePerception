He twisted Bond around brusquely in search of other weaponry. \u201cSearch him.\u201d While the thin man kept his gun trained on Bond\u2019s unquiet chest, the Corsican roughly stripped Bond\u2019s revolver out of its shoulder holster. Bond suddenly decided. Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond\u2019s foot whistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond\u2019s shoe at the top of its arc, and twisted it sharply. Le Chiffre observed his assistant\u2019s work attentively. The two gunmen dragged Bond to his feet. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons.\n Let\u2019s not waste time.\u201d Vesper was being led down a passage towards the back of the house. Le Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the right. His plan was to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with the girl.\n As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion that he hoped went unnoticed, moved his fountain pen deeper into his breast pocket, he righted himself with minimal damage.\n barked Le Chiffre.\n With a backward kick which connected with the thin man\u2019s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him, Bond hurled himself down the passage after her."

                "He smiled broadly, and flipped the comb well out of Bond\u2019s reach. Unfortunately, the second gunman had accurately judged the rest of Bond\u2019s motion. As he crashed to the ground, Bond rolled agilely and, with a motion in which he took great pride, he righted himself with minimal damage. He crossed the room to Bond, and patted him down once again. They roughly stripped Bond\u2019s revolver out of its shoulder holster. barked Le Chiffre.\n As the three men approached him, Bond suddenly whirled around and caught one of the gunmen squarely in the stomach with a well-placed shove of his heel. He caught Bond\u2019s shoe at the top of its arc and twisted it sharply. Three large men leapt through, guns drawn. He noticed that he had a white thread on his lapel, and removed it. As Bond turned to leave the room, the door burst in toward him. Bond felt puny and impotent. Le Chiffre pulled out Bond\u2019s pocket comb and ran his finger down its teeth. \u201cCome, my dear friend,\u201d said Le Chiffre. Filled with confidence after defeating Le Chiffre, Bond had extended an invitation to Vesper to dine with him in the hotel restaurant. The largest of the men was Le Chiffre, Bond\u2019s recently vanquished opponent.\n The two gunmen carefully searched Bond. Bond was unharmed, but he was trapped.\n Bond smiled at the elegant figure he presented.\n \u201cSearch him.\u201d Bond looked in the mirror of his hotel room to make certain that his black tie was centered in his collar. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time.\u201d\n They twisted him around in search of other weaponry.\n Le Chiffre observed his assistants' work attentively.

Light from the hall spilled in, revealing another gun pointing at his chest.\n As Bond\u2019s eyes grew accustomed to the dark of the office, he hurried toward the door. At this, the large man contorted his face into what he might have intended as a smile. Blofeld continued, \u201cTie up Mr. Bond.\u201d\n It made him look no less ugly. Crushak grunted to indicate that he was done. He was met there, however, by a very large and very ugly man.
