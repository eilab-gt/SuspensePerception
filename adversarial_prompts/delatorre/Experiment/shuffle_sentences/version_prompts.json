                "4 That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of colour on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. However, the service stairwell wasn\u2019t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building\u2019s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. Overall, it was an agreeable job. Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. It wasn\u2019t a particularly interesting job. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley and continued his typical working day. He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn\u2019t bother to position the \u201dwet floor\u201d warning signs at the top of each section. Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital\u2019s eight floors.   Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell.",
                "5 \u201cBy the time we get there and wait for it to come, it\u2019ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.\u201d It\u2019s not worth taking the lift,\u201d he said, realising his colleague\u2019s intention. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. \u201cThe patient is on the 6th floor. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital\u2019s secondary corridors.   The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand.",
                "6 His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle.    Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn\u2019t stay upright. The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag.",
                "7 The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d warned his colleague, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been damaged. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted.   Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d continued the first. The other nodded, pulling back his hand. Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other. It\u2019s best to call the doctors.\u201d \u201cYou stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.\u201d He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital.",
                "8 \u201cMove away, please,\u201d asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. However, the doctors were soon there.   Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn\u2019t moved. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague.",
                "9 After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs.    He closed the case. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge.",
                "10 If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child\u2019s life been hanging in the balance. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. Everything depended on the metabolic rate.   According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work. He felt decidedly nervous.",
                "11 Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope.   Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre. One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. The metabolic rate gave cause for optimism: the organ had not been damaged by the impact.",

He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn\u2019t bother to position the \u201dwet floor\u201d warning signs at the top of each section. However, the service stairwell wasn\u2019t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building\u2019s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean. It wasn\u2019t a particularly interesting job. The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of colour on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor. He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley and continued his typical working day. Overall, it was an agreeable job.   Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell. That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes.",
                "5  The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell. This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents. Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift. On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital\u2019s secondary corridors. The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. \u201cThe patient is on the 6th floor. His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand. It\u2019s not worth taking the lift,\u201d he said, realising his colleague\u2019s intention. \u201cBy the time we get there and wait for it to come, it\u2019ll have taken longer than walking down two floors.\u201d",
                "6   The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance. His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle. The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. Since his other foot was already raised he couldn\u2019t stay upright.",
                "7 Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well. He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. It\u2019s best to call the doctors.\u201d \u201cYou stay here watching it, in case anyone comes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d continued the first.   Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped. The other nodded, pulling back his hand. The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again. He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d warned his colleague, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been damaged. Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other.",
                "8 Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague. His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step. Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange.   Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn\u2019t moved. Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall. However, the doctors were soon there. \u201cMove away, please,\u201d asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. He heard them rushing up the service stairwell.",
                "9 He closed the case.    After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs. It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge. The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping.",
                "10 If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. Everything depended on the metabolic rate. His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver. The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope. The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct.   According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination. He felt decidedly nervous. With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work.

One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues. After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis. The metabolic rate confirmed his worst fears: the organ had definitively deteriorated as a result of the impact. As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times. Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger. Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope.",

                "1 Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ. Finally, at 21:26, the medical team certified the death of Robert Bent, without having been able to carry out the liver transplant due to the damage that the organ sustained in transit. However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical. On that day, since 8 a.m., an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. This is the story of what happened.   What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008.",
                "2  At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition.",
                "3 Realizing that he hadn\u2019t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof.   Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades. One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver. The other shouted something inaudible. The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit. During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose.",
