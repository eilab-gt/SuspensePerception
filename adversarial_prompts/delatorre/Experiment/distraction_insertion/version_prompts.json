During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. ",
                "4  Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell.  Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital\u2019s eight floors.  It wasn\u2019t a particularly interesting job.  The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of colour on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor.  Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  Overall, it was an agreeable job.  However, the service stairwell wasn\u2019t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building\u2019s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean.  He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn\u2019t bother to position the \u201dwet floor\u201d warning signs at the top of each section.  That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes.  He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley and continued his typical working day. ",
                "5  The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell.  On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital\u2019s secondary corridors.  This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents.  Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift.  The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  \u201cThe patient is on the 6th floor.  It\u2019s not worth taking the lift,\u201d he said, realising his colleague\u2019s intention.  \u201cBy the time we get there and wait for it to come, it\u2019ll have taken longer than walking down two floors. \u201d His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand. ",
                "6  His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle.  Since his other foot was already raised he couldn\u2019t stay upright.  Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance.  The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. ",
                "7  Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped.  Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other.  The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again.  \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d warned his colleague, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been damaged.  It\u2019s best to call the doctors. \u201d The other nodded, pulling back his hand. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d continued the first.  \u201cYou stay here watching it, in case anyone comes. \u201d Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well.  He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital.  He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. ",
                "8  Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn\u2019t moved.  Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall.  His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step.  Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  However, the doctors were soon there.  He heard them rushing up the service stairwell.  Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague.  \u201cMove away, please,\u201d asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. ",
                "9  He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs.  It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge.  After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  He closed the case.  The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. ",
                "10  According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination.  The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct.  The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope.  Everything depended on the metabolic rate.  To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work.  His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver.  He felt decidedly nervous.  He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child\u2019s life been hanging in the balance.  If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. ",
                "11  Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre.  Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger.  One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues.  Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube.  As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times.  After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis.  The metabolic rate gave cause for optimism: the organ had not been damaged by the impact. ",
                "12  Finally, at 21:26, the medical team verified that Robert Bent\u2019s newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly, and had not been affected by the damage that it sustained in transit. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.. "

                "9  He heard a click when the doctor pressed either end of the handle with his thumbs.  It divided in two, the outer case opening to reveal a sort of small padded fridge.  After a brief look the doctor turned to those watching, shaking his head. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  He closed the case.  The fridge had ruptured with the impact, and there was a long split down one side from which a thin stream of refrigerated air was slowly escaping. ",
                "10  According to the initial diagnosis, the interior polyurethane bag was urgently transferred to the hepatology laboratory, where the liver was removed for examination.  The superficial condition of the organ appeared to be correct.  The enzyme activity was still sufficiently low, which gave the medical team hope.  Everything depended on the metabolic rate.  To check this it was necessary to make a clean puncture and carry out a subsequent biopsy. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  With his face covered by a mask, everyone else in the laboratory moved back to give the surgeon in charge space to work.  His gloved hands guided a small syringe, the point located approximately halfway down the left lobe of the liver.  He felt decidedly nervous.  He had carried out numerous biopsies but never before had a child\u2019s life been hanging in the balance.  If he was one millimetre out he would damage the organ irreparably. ",
                "11  Holding his breath, he inserted the needle one centimetre.  Relieved to not encounter any resistance, he carefully drew out the plunger.  One quarter of the syringe filled with a transparent liquid, which he passed to one of his colleagues.  Satisfied, he wiped the sweat from his brow with his uniform and watched as his colleague put barely two drops of liquid on a Petri dish and placed it under the microscope. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  The surgeon lowered his mask and looked down the tube.  As he analysed the sample, he sporadically pursed his lips, occasionally lifting his head to blink several times.  After an interminable half a minute, he moved away from the microscope and looked with concern at his colleagues, who were anxiously awaiting the diagnosis.  The metabolic rate gave cause for optimism: the organ had not been damaged by the impact. ",
                "12  Finally, at 21:26, the medical team verified that Robert Bent\u2019s newly transplanted liver was functioning correctly, and had not been affected by the damage that it sustained in transit. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.. "

                "1  What you are about to read is the story of a real event that took place at the UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, in San Francisco, California, on 24 February 2008.  On that day, since 8 a. m. , an eight year old boy called Robert Bent and the entire medical team treating him were all ready for his imminent liver transplant. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  Just the day before a suitable donor had been found, and they were now awaiting the arrival of the organ.  However, they were not sure if Robert would survive the wait as his situation was critical.  This is the story of what happened. ",
                "2  At 08:57 the helicopter carrying the organ landed punctually on the roof of the hospital where Robert Bent was in a critical but stable condition. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it.. ",
                "3  Whilst the rotors were still turning, two men descended from the helicopter, heads down and hair blown by the whirlwind of the spinning blades.  One of them was clutching a blue case that was storing, at a temperature of four degrees centigrade and fully functioning, the compatible liver.  The other shouted something inaudible. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  Realizing that he hadn\u2019t managed to make himself heard over the noise of the blades, he touched his colleague on the shoulder, pointed at the watch on his wrist and then at the doorway off the roof.  The man carrying the case gave a visible nod and, still ducking down, moved away from the helicopter towards the exit.  During the journey they had been told that the patient was in a critical situation and they had no time to lose. ",
                "4  Just a few minutes earlier, the cleaner had finished mopping the floor of the service stairwell.  Like every morning, he had started from the ground floor, working his way up each of the hospital\u2019s eight floors.  It wasn\u2019t a particularly interesting job.  The service stairwell had no windows and the only spot of colour on the dull walls was the red of the fire extinguishers, which were always positioned in the same place on the landings between every second floor.  Cleaning the corridors was much more enjoyable: the doctors were usually friendly, and there was always a bored patient happy to have a chat. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  Overall, it was an agreeable job.  However, the service stairwell wasn\u2019t dirty: the staff used the lifts or any of the three staircases distributed in the building\u2019s wings, so there was never anything needing a thorough clean.  He whistled as he worked his way up the stairs, with just a mop, a bucket and a cloth hanging from his pocket, and, so as not to have to carry them, he didn\u2019t bother to position the \u201dwet floor\u201d warning signs at the top of each section.  That morning, like every morning, he finished mopping in fifteen minutes.  He took the lift back down to the ground floor, collected the cleaning trolley and continued his typical working day. ",
                "5  The helipad exit was a metal ramp, now under cover, which led to the service stairwell.  On the service stairwell landing there was another door leading onto one of the hospital\u2019s secondary corridors.  This corridor housed the central archives, the main storeroom and, finally, the rooms reserved for doctors and residents.  Round a bend at the end of the corridor was the east wing lift.  The man carrying the case went to enter the corridor, but the other caught his arm. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  \u201cThe patient is on the 6th floor.  It\u2019s not worth taking the lift,\u201d he said, realising his colleague\u2019s intention.  \u201cBy the time we get there and wait for it to come, it\u2019ll have taken longer than walking down two floors. \u201d His colleague shrugged and moved away from the door, holding the bannister of the service stairwell with his free hand. ",
                "6  His foot slipped the moment he placed it on the first step, twisting his ankle.  Since his other foot was already raised he couldn\u2019t stay upright.  Without thinking, to stop himself from falling he reached out to grab hold of the bannister with his other hand, letting go of the case. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  The case rolled down the stairs whilst the man managed to hold on and recover his balance.  The two men held their breath as they watched in horror how the case spun over on every step, making a noise that sounded like a bunch of loose keys being shaken in a bag. ",
                "7  Finally, the case reached the bottom and stopped.  Three seconds later the two men were kneeling down beside it, looking at each other.  The man who seconds before had been in charge of the case reached out his arm to pick it up again.  \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d warned his colleague, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been damaged.  It\u2019s best to call the doctors. \u201d The other nodded, pulling back his hand. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d continued the first.  \u201cYou stay here watching it, in case anyone comes. \u201d Without wasting any time he set off down the stairs, taking care not to slip as well.  He went down the two floors and went through the door into the hospital.  He walked quickly through the complex network of corridors until reaching the reception desk in the transplant department, from where the medical team was alerted. ",
                "8  Meanwhile, keeping a firm hold on the bannister, his colleague hadn\u2019t moved.  Standing beside the case, he was trying to think of anything except the possibility that the content of the package had been damaged by the fall.  His ankle hurt, he was bearing his weight on his injured foot, whilst the other was hardly touching the step.  Despite the pain, he had no intention of moving, overwhelmed by the superstition that the condition of that liver in some way depended on the suffering he was capable of offering in exchange. He looked for his hidden watch. He couldn't find it..  However, the doctors were soon there.  He heard them rushing up the service stairwell.  Directly, three doctors appeared, followed by his colleague.  \u201cMove away, please,\u201d asked one of the doctors, who was kneeling down next to the case. ",
